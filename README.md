# Restaurant Recommedation System
This project its intended for a Traveler as an app or html page that gives restaurants or places to visit based in his preferences and  his location.

# Details of the project
    We will get the initial information: *user preferences and location* from a HTLM page coding with JavaScript, CSS & Bootstrap. 
    We will take our datasets from Yelp! API  yelp_academic_dataset_bussines  and we will process and clean with Python Pandas.
    We will train our model according to the reviews of the restaurant and its location, using Unsupervised Machine Learning with K-means clustering based on the reviews or opinions of previous users. 
    We will display our recommendations results  in another HTML page.
    We will use Content Based  Filtering  it makes recommendation based on user preferences  en vez de Collaborative based filtering what requieres other users.

# Tool
    Python libraries

# Mockup of the Machine Learning 

    1. Data Preparation
        a)  Data Selecction (Quality of the data: what data is avalable, what data is missing, and what data con be removed) 
        b)  Data Processing (formatting, cleaning and sampling)
        c)  Data Transformation (Transforming our data into a simpler format for future use, such as CSV, spreadsheet or Database) 

    2.  Preprocessing data with Pandas.
        a)  What knowledge do we hope to glean from running an unsupervised learning model on this dataset?
        b)  What data is available? What type? What is missing? What can be removed?
        c)  Is the data in a format that can be passed into an unsupervised learning model?
        d)  Can I quickly hand off this data for others to use?
    
    3.  Clustering data. Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning that groups data points together.
        K-means Algorithm: K-means is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to identify and solve clustering issues. K represents how many clusters are. 



        
The only way to determine what an unsupervised algorithm did with the data is to go through it manually or create visualizations. Since there will be a manual aspect, unsupervised learning is great for when you want to explore the data. Sometimes you'll use the information provided to you by the unsupervised algorithm to transition to a more targeted, supervised model.

As with supervised learning, data should be preprocessed into a correct format with only numerical values, null value determination, and so forth. The only difference is unsupervised learning doesn't have a target variable—it only has input features that will be used to find patterns in the data. It's important to carefully select features that could help to find those patterns or create groups.





Yelp is a business directory service and crowd-sourced review forum. The company develops, hosts and markets the Yelp.com website and the Yelp mobile app, which publish crowd-sourced reviews about businesses. It also operates an online reservation service called Yelp Reservations.

Yelp attempted to solve the problem “What should I eat?” This quickly expanded to include other business to answer other questions. This can best be represented as “I’m in [town]. Where can I go to get the [best/fastest/cheapest/easiest] [food/service/etc]?” Your friend’s recommendations are likely the largest influencer of where you will go if you have no preference. Yelp provided a service for when that was either not available or not trusted.
