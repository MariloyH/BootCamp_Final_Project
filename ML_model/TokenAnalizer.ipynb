      "One of my favorite places to go to in Philly  and I take every one of my visiting friends here! This place has a lot of yummy stores and awesome stores ( recommended: the grilled cheese place at Meltkraft Grilled Cheese  the donuts at Beilers  4 Seasons Juice Bar  Muellar's Chocolate Co.  icecream from Bassetts  and local honey from Bee Natural). I love coming here  and even though it can get really crowded during lunch hours on the weekends  it's still worth it.\n",
      "This might be a bit unfair to have a single review  as each stall has very different fare with a variety of qualities. It can definitely be considered food heaven  but on the contrary on a Saturday morning can be Philadelphia hell. The produce at Iovines is very good and fresh  and very very reasonably priced. It can be hectic but the lines go extremely quickly. The rest of the market tends to have very long lines - but the lines can be an indication of the HAVE TO eat. The Original Turkeys turkey sandwhich with cranberry and stuffing. The Cannolis at Termini Bros (best I've ever had)  Becks Cajun Hurricane Sandwhich  Anything at Beilers  but especially their Donuts and their pecan cinnamon rolls  The Reuban or Rachel from Hershels  DiNicks Roast Pork  Dienner's chicken  but most importantly Millers Twist! Its definitely an experience you dont want to miss as a tourist  and if your a local you already go there regularly!\n",
      "Alright  I remember the first time I went to the reading terminal and being overwhelmed by the barrage of smells  noise  and people walking back and forth experiencing this massive food/dining market all at the same time. In order to save you  my readers from doing the same research I did to find the 'best of the best '   Here is a list of my suggestions (you can view my personal reviews as needed)  1. Any pretzels from Miller's twist - $2.5 (soooo delicious) 2. Roast pork sandwich from DiNic's - $8-10 (very intense provolone taste  voted best in many food magazines) 3. Gumbo at Beck's Cajun Cafe - $10 (lots of flavors  big bowel  a little bit salty)  Additional things to try (from other viewers) 1. Beiler's doughnuts 2. Roast duck noodle platter at Sang Kee Peking Duck House 3. Apple dumplings at Dutch Eating Place  If you want to explore  I'd recommend going aisle by aisle first to see what's available before you settle down. Here's my recs:  Step 1 - walk and explore Step 2 - choose where you want food(s) from Step 3 - find a table (hardest part) Step 4 - have one person sit there and then get food. Step 5 - don't forget to get napkins and utensils Step 6 - eat and repeat\n",
      "It's an experience  to say the least!  Not as many good vegan options since Basic 4 left  but it is still a neat place and a good place to get breads  jams  produce  and other delicious things.\n",

      "fresh seafood and produce. fresh breads  cheese wheels spices and great restaurants for lunch\n",
      "Reading terminal is always crowded. The food is fresh  the people are from different places. The environment is awesome.\n",
      "Go hungry and early!  Can eat anywhere in the market and get a great meal.  Doesn't matter which spot you pick  I've lived in Philly for 6 years and haven't been able to go to every single spot here.  When I last checked I have been to about 75% of all the stands.  It will satisfy any and all cravings you have.  Just follow your nose!\n",
      "This is a great spot for fresh local foods  candies to taste there or buy produce and meats to take home. Great farm to table market place! I wish I lived closer so I could have brought some of them home! I had a Dinics sandwich and some great candies from local companies.\n",
      "In one word: Dry.  In three words: Dry and flavorless.  Preferred Geno's  but only because his cheez whiz makes it less dry.  My comparison review of Genos v. Pats: Despite their poor reviews on Yelp for being over priced  less than spectacular  and staffed by greasy men with the unique streak of arrogance borne of notoriety  we felt that experiencing the origins of the 'steak would be more rewarding than tracking down steakeries more highly regarded by the on-line community.   So off to South Philly we ventured. We had been warned by other steak hunters that the area inhabited by the legendary steakeries was dilapidated and dangerous- so we were happily surprised to find them located in a vibrant community reminiscent of the San Francisco Mission (except with a lot less Latinos and a lot more Italians.)   Arriving unmolested  we broke into teams to procure steaks from each of the shops (without out having to stand in both the long winding lines sequentially.) Our team went to Geno's  while Priscilla  Tammy and Sam went to Pat's to pick up our steaks.  Geno's was interestingly decorated in photo's of the owner and his son posing with scantily-clad  skanky looking women and various celebs  as well as over the top pro-American propaganda and anti-immigrant rhetoric.   I was warned by a woman in line that I must order our steaks with the whiz. Apparently it caused quite an uproar when John Kerry failed to order the traditional \\South Philly \\\" from Geno's- note that Pat's doesn't serve the whiz  so apparently the style only represents the north corner of the intersection  rather than all of South Philly.  When I returned to our seats  team 2 had already procured our steaks from Pats. Apparently some confusion had occurred during ordering  and we now had in our possession 7 steaks- 4 from Pats  and 3 from Genos.   Both steaks were pretty basic- thin strips of steak with onions on bland French rolls  Pat's came with the traditional Provolone and Geno's with the aforementioned Cheese Whiz.  I started by eating one half of a Pat's steak. It was decent  but uninspiring. Several members of the expedition complained that Pat's Steaks were too dry. While not overly moist  I didn't share their concern  however the flavor was lacking in my opinion. Pat's Steaks were very bland in flavor  reminding me of my own creations before I got down with Montreal seasoning and fresh garlic. The cheese was also lacking in flavor.   Next  I moved onto a Geno's steak  with the Whiz. I was intrigued by the flavor and consistency of the Whiz  the steak was juicier than Pat's and the Whiz and grease mixed into thin cheese-gravy that soaked the otherwise bland roll. The meat was similarly bland to that of Pat's  but the flavor of the Whiz compensated for the most part.   I ended up consuming about 2.5-3 steaks in various portions in the sitting  as a excess had been ordered and various members of the expedition were unable to complete their missions  so I feel that I am qualified to end the age old debate as to who makes the best Cheese Steak:  Consensus amongst the group was that Geno's made the better steak of the two  but Geno's lost points due to the quasi-racist vibe  and at least 1 member of the expedition didn't care much for the Whiz. If we had spent more than a single night in Philly  we would have undoubtedly searched for less famous  but more delectable competition  but unfortunately we left the City of Brotherly love disappointed by the over-hyped  over-rated 'steaks.    Mike's Ratings: (On a scale from 1-5  5 being perfect and 1 being inedible.)   Cheese Steak Shop: 4.5-5 (Great tasting  but pretty expensive. I require a 15' to fully satisfy my hunger) Geno's: 3-3.5 (Tasty  also too damn expensive)  Pat's: 2.5-3 (Very bland  I can do better at home.)   Vanessa's Ratings: Cheese Steak Shop: 5 (\\\"Yummy!\\\") Geno's: 3.5 (\\\"I wouldn't go out of my way to stand in that line & he's racist.\\\") Pat's: 2 (\\\"It was too dry.\\\")\"\n",

      "So basically because it's famous  they over charge for their overly greasy and mediocre cheesesteaks  but you're still going to go here. The guy taking my order reminded me of the Soup Nazi and I was scared to mess up my order. A cheesesteak is $10  fries $4.50. Crazy right? The sizes are smaller than others I've had  extremely greasy  under seasoned and extremely overrated. As fast as I got my cheesesteak it wasn't even hot  what?! Jim's and Ishkabibble's on South St are way better... don't waste your time or money.\n",
      "You. Are. Kidding. This is the worst cheese steak I ever had! Stale bread  grizzled meat. Not even close to good. The Emperor's New Clothes. A joke and a ripoff. Geno's is no better  by the way. These are gimmicks.  Go to Sheetz.\n",
      "I can't really compare Pat's and Geno's since I didn't have to taste Geno's cheesteaks  but Pat's was quite good!  There were so many flavor combination available but I stuck to \\Steak Whiz Wit-Out\\\"(no onions just cheez whiz)! Make sure you do your order right  be quick and have cash.  @ lunch-be prepared to find parking and/or eat while standing. Don't you worry...it's all worth it.  I stopped @ Pat's hours before my flight back to Cali and wished I ordered another one for my plane ride back home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally a real Philly Cheese Steak. I got a whiz wit. The bread was soft  the meat was  well meaty  and the cheese was whizzy. Best cheese steak I ever had.\n",
      "Claim to be the inventors of the Philly Cheesesteak. We literally walked 2.5 miles to get here (our own decision)  so we were starving when we got there. Don't worry when you see the long line  they serve about 15 people a minute (no joke). I asked for American cheese on mine  but I'm pretty sure you get cheese wiz no matter what. Also watch out for the service: I'm pretty sure the rudeness is part of the act  but I was very taken aback when the guy yelled at me WHILE I was ordering. Definitely be prepared when you step up to order.  All of that being said  the food was great! I got the cheesesteak with onions and covered it with ketchup. Delicious! And definitely get the fries!! Literally the best fries I've ever had. If you're looking for fast food  this is a great choice. Minus one star only for the service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meh. Not too impressed.So I had to do the Pat's vs Geno's taste test for myself after seeing it on The Travel Channel.Lets start with the building.....it looks like Snooki & Jwoww live there.VERY GAUDY.If they put the effort they put into making the outside of the building gaudy into their Cheesesteaks then maybe their Cheesesteaks would be really good.I ordered a Cheesesteak add Provolone American and onions.The bread was really chewy compared to Pat's and the meat was very dry.The meat to bread ratio just wasn't right either there was just too much dry  chewy bread & too little meat.At one point while I was chewing a bite I felt like I had cotton mouth.(Beleive me that's not a good feeling.) There was definitely less meat and cheese on my Geno's cheesesteak & overall the sandwich was just bigger at Pat's. I know that there are waaay better cheesesteak places than these 2 in Philly because we asked some locals but I had to do the \\touristy taste test \\\"thing for myself.The results are in  and the winner is..........Pat's. Next time I come to Philly I won't be coming to either one of these just because I wanna go try other places but if you absolutely had to choose from these 2 then it's definitely Pat's hands down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Kind of disappointed that after waiting 20+ mins in line in the freezing cold weather  the cheesesteak was not worth it. Wanted to try an authentic philly cheesesteak whilst there  so upon looking at the piling long lines of people waiting to get their hands on geno's Philly cheesesteak we joined the line as well  thinking long lines = Awesome food. Boy  were we wrong. Ordered 1 philly  1 mushroom philly. Taste was bland  no flavor  bread as mentioned in numerous other reviews was chewy and i second that 100%. The meat seemed not up to the standards of philly steaks. And to add a cherry on top  the old lady at the cash register tried to short change me. Delassandros was way way way way way better when I had their cheesesteaks before.  So as of now  number 1 cheesesteak is still mitchels in OCMD  number 2 delassandros  philly. Number 3 ??\n",
      "Yeah  there's a rivalry with Pat's. Yeah  they have neon. Yeah  their bread is fresher. However  I think Geno's is average. With so many options in the city  Geno's is popular because that's where the tourists go. Try Chinks or Delassandros  much better experience. If you want the typical Philly cheese steak experience  go to Geno's. If you want a better steak  go somewhere else.\n",
      "Well  here is another three star rating and this is why .   I am a native Californian so I can picture it already. \\EY  Waddayanow about steaks?\\\" Well  l may not know cheesesteaks  but I know what I like.   I did like the sandwich  but it wasn't what I thought it would be. It had good flavor  and I loved the onions. I ordered it \\\"wizz  wit\\\" and I was surprised how FAST they get things done. I also got the cheese fries and a drink. All in all it was around $15 (!) and I ate it right there on the benches. Yes  it was cold with the wind blowing.   The best way I can describe it is to draw a parallel observation with another LA landmark that people rave and fawn over. King Taco. Sure  they make good food. Sure they serve tons of customers every night and are rather well known. Sure they make GREAT late night stops. However  late night munchies are not really the best way to judge foodstuffs. Perhaps being soaked in booze from late night carousing adds to the overall experience. There is NOTHING wrong with that. Just in the same way I like King Taco  I liked Geno's.  I however  have had better cheesesteaks. So far  the best cheesesteak I have had in the US was at Moochie's in Salt Lake City. It is not blasphemy  and it in no way takes Geno's down for what it is. A pioneer in the field of cheeseteaks with a history only perhaps one other restaurant can rival. That rivalry I am sure also adds to the legend.   Still  3 stars for the food. -Subject to change based on intoxication-\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Take a picture there then leave. If you're unbelievably famished  then order the cheese fries.\n",
      "Geno's suffers from being over exposed and hyped  but really from a purely impartial standpoint  their steaks are above average.  I think the steak itself is a 3.5 star product  but their hot sauce earns a star just by itself.  It's one of the best (and spiciest restaurant hot sauces I've encountered).  Give it a shot  the hot sauce makes the steak twice as good.  Be forewarned to add it sparingly -- it is hella hot.  If you think of hot sauces on a scale of 1 to 10  where Frank's Red Hot is a 1.5 and Tabasco is a 3.  The Geno's hot sauce is a 7.\n",
      "Worst steak I've had in Philly. Cannot understand why anyone likes this place. The folks behind the counter are unfriendly at best and down right rude under normal conditions.  Food-wise  the steak was very bland. No salt/pepper. Cheese was like plastic. Way over priced for soggy  bland food. A real let down.  I took my wife here as she was new to Philly as a tourist treat and we were sorely disappointed. The best steak I've had thus far is the unknown joint up on Somerset and Broad  \\Broad Street Steaks\\\". So good you'll hurt yourself!  Leave this guy and his rude ways and get a real steak some place else.\"\n",
      "Great food  slightly over priced. Nacho mamas are great and so is the lobster.\n",
      "Being a Mexican that was born and raised in California has left me with a bit of a snobby complex when it comes to Mexican food. El Vez first and foremost  looks inviting and fun. Every time I walked by you would see these massive bowls of guacamole and it seemed like everyone was drinking margaritas. My mom and I tried to get a table but the wait was 2 hours and reservations were booked all the way into the next week. I decided next time I was in philly  I would call ahead and book a table. When I finally did eat there  I wasn't disappointed. The owner really put in the effort to keep the place authentic. The food was a little more gourmet than your average CA street taco man  but it was still delicious. The margaritas were strong and delicious and the guac was yummy too. Overall  a great experience.\n",
      "We were looking for a brunch spot  our first choice had to long of a wait so we tried this place. We never had Mexican themed brunch before  it was delicious! The service was good (not great but it met the need). It was not a long wait between ordering and getting our food. I would visit here again!\n",
      "We went here while on vacation in Philly last week. It was my favorite and most memorable meal of the trip! We had the original guacamole and it was amazing. I also had a delicious margarita. For dinner my boyfriend ordered chicken enchiladas which were really great  and i ordered the carne asada  which was the best thing of the whole meal. Michelle was our server and was really sweet! My boyfriend forgot his shopping bag there and they held onto it for us until we could come back the next day (in nyc where we live  that bag would have been gone!!!)\n",
      "I say this is the best/most creative Mexican food in Philly. For a college student or (poor) young professional  this is definitely a treat yo'self dining experience. But it's SO worth it!  Advice:  1. This is my go-to margarita place  so definitely start with one! They're all wonderful  depending on your taste  and made with a generous amount of alcohol. I've had the original one as well as the pineapple margarita and both were delicious.  2.Share some guac with your friends! De la hoya is my favorite! So fresh  and the chips are homemade and perfectly crispy. 3. Two Words: MACHO NACHOS. These are prepared in a large  skillet-type dish  so EVERY chip is nicely covered with toppings. Great for sharing between 3 or 4 people if you're all getting entrees as well.  4. Try the Crispy Mahi Tacos for your meal! Beautiful presentation  fresh fish  and a complementary sauce that's the perfect combination of tang and spice.  5. If you have room  order the corn on the cob as a side. This comes covered in cheese and savory spices.   I've never had room for dessert at El Vez! Every time I leave  I'm happily full and already thinking about the next time I can go back!\n",
      "Overall a great menu  great atmosphere and great service. Really enjoyed eating here.   Food: we ordered the Cesar Chavez guacamole which had Oaxaca cheese and pasila balsamic sauce as an appetizer. The guacamole had very unique flavors and the presentation was beautiful. For entree  I tried the chicken tacos which were deliciously seasoned and paired with a juicy salsa and a slice of avocado. The plate presentation was really beautiful as well.   Atmosphere: the decor of the restaurant was really unique and beautiful - it's a very colorful restaurant. It's a loud environment since it seems to always be crowded and has a bar so if you are looking for a quiet sit down dinner I wouldn't recommend coming here.   Service: the service was great  our waitress gave us ample time to order and was quick to get the food out to us despite it being crowded.   My one tip is to make a reservation. We hadn't made one and were told it would be an hour and a half wait for 4 people at around 4pm on a Saturday which didn't seem to be a busy time for any other restaurants located near by. We were lucky and only ended up waiting about 20-30 mins and browsed the stores near by. So to be safe  definitely make a reservation if you don't want to wait!\n",
      "Being from Texas  I enjoy Mexican food and while traveling for work a co-worker found this place and fell in love!  I went twice while I was there and absolutely love the Chicken Tortilla Soup and I'm not a big soup person.  The Macho Nachos are big enough to serve 4 people and are better with Chicken than Beef.  They are famous for their different kinds of guacamole (I never had any but heard they were good).   I had the Blood Orange Margarita and it was pretty good.    The place is a little pricey but is worth it.  Also they were kind enough to give us a call on our cell phone when our table was ready if there was longer than a 30 minute wait.  Kind of sad that I'm not traveling to Philly anymore because I will miss this place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great atmosphere  good food  and delicious margaritas.\n",
      "I've only been here for the guac and mojitos to be honest  but neither disappoint. My favorite guac by far is the Cesar Chavez. I get it every time and the portion is  enough for a full meal. Hence why I only ever come for guac--I'm too full to order anything else.  However  I'm also too broke to order anything else. The prices are quite high. Also  you ALWAYS need to make reservations  and even if you get there on time  you're still waiting.  Atmospherically  the decor is nice  but it's always so loud. I find myself screaming at my friends whenever we're talking at the table.  I've come here a few times  but not often because of the price  the wait  and the loud ambiance. Though the mojitos are good  the guac is really the only thing that keeps me coming back.\n",
      "date night with girlfriend here was perfect. i wouldn't say im so much a foodie but i love to eat good food. 9:45 reservation  walked right to our table. exceptional service from start to finish. Jeff was our server he was great. we both did the 39$ plAn and we started with humus tahani and the most amazing phenomenal soft warm pita bread. next we each chose 2 small plates (fried broccoli  cucumber and yogurt  short rips and potatoes which melted in my mouth  and chicken pastilla!) they were perfect and filling. they also served us side mediterterannean salad items (carrots  zucchini  etc) lamb and beef kofte followed these. incredible and the most amazing flourless frozen almond chocolate cake and some kind of amazing ice cream.... well basically  im a 25 yeAr old student and it was a pleasure spending 122$ on a fantastic meal in an incredible atmosphere with a pretty ambiance with above average service. would most definitely recommend\n",
      "Can't say enough good things about Zahav! This restaurant is an amazing experience from start to finish. Tucked back behind a Rtiz Theatre and Positano Coast  this isn't a place that would normally would stand out  but word has travelled far and wide that this is a must try restaurant in Philly at this point.   We went in two of the last three years for my wife's birthday and couldn't have left happier. They do every aspect of a restaurant experience right. The servers are all really friendly  and explain what every item is for those of us who's only experience with Israeli food is Zahav. The bartenders treat you like family and take great care of you when dining at the bar. Chris  who was waiting on us from behind the bar last night  was tremendous. He explained everything in great detail  took my wife's dietary restrictions and immediately pointed out three things we'd want to avoid on the menu  and took my love for Bluecoat Gin and instantly had a drink in mind for me  which was delicious. Plus  he was good to chat with for the very short period between courses.   The food is all so different from what I'm used to  but I am yet to try something here that I didn't love. For example  I've never eaten hummus (I know  not that scary) other than the two visits I've had to Zahav (it's a choice I've made  also won't touch tofu or turkey bacon for example)  but when I'm here I'll go for it and it's just delightful. When you consider the fact that when you order the tasting with another person you are going to eat literally about 20 different items in that sitting. There should be something that completely grosses you out  but it just doesn't happen for some reason. You sit there wondering if there could be anyone there not loving their experience. It's that good.   Some things I loved: -The hummus  both their traditional tahina and the warm Turkish. Delicious with that bread fresh out of the oven.  -The crispy grape leaves. Never enjoyed one as much as these. Nice little kick of heat in them as well. -The grilled Haloumi. This cheese  if you haven't tried it  is a game changer. I honestly didn't even realize it was a cheese when I ordered it  but then instantly remembered the last place I had it  which was Kanella  as soon as I bit into it. So good. -The fried potato. Super crispy. Super delicious.  -The branzino. The fish has a perfectly crispy skin on top  great flavor  and the tzatziki just adds to it.   If you like trying different foods and thinking spending a little extra for a perfect dining experience is worth it  this is somewhere you want to be.\n",
      "As a foodie  I spend a lot of time researching places to eat whenever I visit new cities. I did a last minute trip to Philly and did not really have time to do extensive research. Shame on me. Luckily  my friends told me about Zahav as I was riding the Amtrak to Philly. I immediately went on OpenTable to book a seat for 1. Surely I could get a table for 1. Well.. nope. The restaurant was full. I looked at a bunch of Yelp reviews and learned that you had to book this restaurant 3 months in advance.   Well  I decided to walk in and try my luck. After all  Anthony Bourdain did eat here and it is one of my life goals to eat at all the restaurants that he has eaten at. As soon as I checked into my hotel  I wasted no time in heading to Zahav. I got to the restaurant around 6:30pm and saw a lot of people waiting. Oh no... would I have to wait too? Well  the host led me straight to the bar where there was an open seat. I felt as if I had just won the jackpot! I settled in my seat and ordered a glass of wine. The bartender that took care of me was absolutely fantastic! I was sitting next to some awkward dude who was eating alone  and we happened to order the same thing. He happened to order before me so his food would come out first  then mine would come out 10 min later  and they were quite similar. I promise I wasn't copying him! I've never had Israeli cousins before  the only thing I knew was that I would not eat pork. That was the extent of my knowledge. The bartender suggested that I do the \\taste of zahav\\\"  which consists of a 4 course meal  with multiple dishes in each course. He suggested that I should take it easy on the appetizers  so that I could focus on eating the main course. After all  the appetizers were  easily packable to bring home. The course cost $48  and is a great way to taste everything. You can also do wine paring for an additional $36. Let's dive into each course: Course #1: salatim & hummus with laffa. Salatim means salads- you get 6 different small salads such as cabbage salad  eggplant salad  green bean salad etc. These were good. The hummus was amazing  there are 3 types to choose from. I had the daily hummus  which had some chicken in it. The bread that comes with the hummus is AMAZING. I almost died. It was so soft and pillowy and fluffy.... Yum. I had a really hard time not eating the whole bread  because I needed to save space for the rest of the courses.  Course #2: 2 mezze. You can pick 2 small dishes from the menu. I picked the fried cauliflower and haloumi. The dark hearts are quite a popular dish  the guy next to me had it... I am not a fan of eating hearts but if you like hearts  I hear its good here. Both dishes were good. The haloumi was amazing  it came with blueberries and pistachio  which sounds like a weird combination  but actually tasted fantastic.  Course #3: Al Ha'esh- grilled dish over coals. I had the grilled branzino. To be honest  I was quite full at this point but ate the whole thing. The skin was nice and crispy  the fish was soft and tender. Course #4: Desert. I had grilled peach with sherbert  and za'atar shortbread.  The shortbread had a nice twice to it  it tasted different from Walkers' shortbread.  The waiter packed all my leftovers for me in separate containers... which I ate that night before going to bed.  I had a wonderful experience here and can't wait to come back. Remember  if you walk in by yourself  you might score a seat at the bar with minimal wait! Or else  make your reservation exactly 3 months in advance!\"\n",
      "I think about that Vanessa Carlton line: \\you know I'd walk a thousand miles...\\\" After I booked my recent trip to Philly the next thing I did was to book this restaurant. What an amazing place! Spectacular food and service. The lamb shoulder with pomegranates and chickpeas is indescribably delicious and I will never forget that first mouthful. Fanatical  yes but go and you will understand.\"\n",
      "Like another reviewer  I had been a bit underwhelmed by my past RW weeks-rushed in and out of places like Butcher & Singer  eating off very limited menus  slow service  etc  etc.  I went for lunch with a friend at Zahav for restaurant week and the experience could not have been better.   For one  the service was fantastic. My friend and I are both students  and normally are given crappy service as a result. At Zahav  the waiter could not have been more patient  explaining each menu item and its flavors. The owner came over in the middle of our meal to ask how it was going as well as at the end of the meal to make sure we had had a great meal. Our meal was the definition of relaxed comfort-I described the atmosphere to one of my friends as 'like a neighborhood place'.  In terms of highlights  the salatim definitely stands out as a can't miss  a large selection of tasty small dishes. There wasn't a bad dish among the ones we had  each unique and full of flavor. My friend basically devoured the hummus  so I have to assume it was good. The potato latke with salmon was also great  it's the kind of dish that you're sad when it's over because it was that good. The duck kebab kind of looked like a 'duck hamburger' in a small patty  I didn't taste the pistachios in it but it still tasted great.  Perhaps the only not amazing part (of which the service more than makes up for) was the dessert. The pistachio cookie of my caramel semifreddo was very tough  although the flavors were good. my friend had the baklava and didn't like it as much as the regular dishes.   All in all  I would gladly pay non-RW prices  it was a fantastic experience and I can't wait to come back soon.\n",
      "Wow!! Sometimes I'm not a fan of tapas places because I feel like it's not nearly enough food for the price you pay  but I was told this restaurant was mandatory for a Philly trip so we went on a whim  no reservations  nothing.   1. Make reservations! We got lucky because we walked in at 10:00 PM and the restaurant closes at 11  so we actually got seated in 15 minutes  but it seems like it would be impossible at normal hours without reservations. 2. Customer service was FANTASTIC. Our server gave great suggestions  didn't rush us  and had a smile on his face until we finally left at midnight.  3. For small plates  the portions are actually pretty decent. We ordered way too much on the menu so my suggestion would to start with 2 plates per person and see where it takes you. The hummus and salatim are huge portions so start with those for the table and take your time ordering.   Will definitely be recommending this restaurant to friends visiting Philly!\n",
      "Believe the hype. I made a reservation for my 2 year wedding anniversary and Zahav made it simply magical.   We ordered from the Tayim tasting menu. Everything was delicious  my husband loved everything and that is enough for me because he is the pickiest eater I have ever met. The service was excellent  gracefully walking the line of attentive and annoying  the best dance I have ever seen for sure.   We started with complimentary pickled salad and champagne :-) Awww. Everyone knew it was our Anniversary it was adorable how many people congratulated us  this made the night truly special.   Salatim was simple and delicious  the hummus was amazing. We ordered the krispy grape leaves*  house smoked sable**  fried potato**  and my favorite the crispy haloumi***. We also were able to taste the Cauliflower  thank you chef! We were already stuffed but ate the entire entree anyway! For the entree we enjoyed the Branzino and the Spiced Eggplant. The Branzino was cooked absolutely perfectly  crispy skin with firm but moist meat  and anyone who can make Eggplant equally delicious is a culinary god.   Thoroughly impressed.  Thank you for the great anniversary :-).\n",

      "5 Star Service - Hostess got me chair to wait out my no reservation appearance  got me a drink  and charged my iPhone! Waiters all remembered my name. So impressed.  Food was amazing. The $45 tasting menu is a great deal! I didn't get that - but I had the Duck Hearts  Crudo  and Branzino - because I'm annoying Californian - no carb - paleo ....I know.  Since I sat the bar  I read the mini-bio on the Chef in his cookbook.... teared me up right away.  I am so glad I didn't sleep in prep for a 6am flight outta Philly the next morning. So glad I dragged my lazy ass out of the hotel to check out this restaurant recommended by my co-workers in our local office. I can't wait to come back!!\n",
      "One of the best meals we had this year! Overall ratings: 5 for location  atmosphere  food  and service  maybe 4 for value because it's a tad expensive  but totally worth it. We were in town for the election and ate at 10 PM following the President's rally at Independence Hall. The place was packed  and several people sported buttons associated with the campaigns. So it was pretty electric to start. Beautiful space  comfortable tables although it's crowded  you are basically hearing every word uttered by the people at the next table. Noise level is almost perfect in today's noisy way: restaurants seem to strive for a high noise level that grants intimacy to your conversation  it's too hard for you to hear each other let alone for others to hear you. At Barbuzzo  We could easily hear each other and the table next to us  and after that  it's all loud white noise. Not complaining  it was actually good. Only complaint: the place is so dark  and the table candles so tiny  that both of us had to use our iPhone flashlights in order to read the menu.  We reserved through OpenTable and were seated immediately. We saw delicious looking pizzas on other tables  and despite both of us trying NOT to eat pizza  we had to try it. Thank goodness we did! We got the simple Margherita pizza  which really shows off a restaurant's ability  and show it did. Amazing. Scrumptious. Perfect crust: crispy  chewy  flavorful. Like few others. Burnt in a good way obviously made in a very hot oven (wood fired?). Beer and wine selection outstanding  someone obviously put love and attention into this. A wine special was an Austrian red  which my wife had: delicious. I had a Sierra Nevada pilsner  again  amazing. Both of us immediately thought of the delicious beers we enjoyed in Netherlands and Germany that tasted so different (and better) than what we get here in the US  and this had that same distinct wonderful fresh flavorful taste. I got a burrata salad (grilled heirloom carrot  pickled rainbow chard  arugula paesto  marcona almonds)  amazing  and unlike anything I've had. Wife had chestnut agnolotti (heirloom squash  roasted celery root  sage brown butter  shaved chestnuts) that tasted sweet. She was crazy about it  I found it sweet but no matter  it was delicious. Closed off the evening with decaf cappuccino (her) and another beer (me).  I can't wait to return here. Well done Barbuzzo!\n",
      "It gets even better!   I've been here twice now and I LOVE this spot!  I think its my favorite place to eat in Philly.  The food here is out of this world.  I ate here on a warm Friday night in March 2011.  We were seated at a table outdoors.... it was a great evening for amazing food.  The pizza here is very good.  Its not the best I have ever had  but it really is up there at the top of the list.  VERY good!   Try the pizza with the fried egg... its great!  The pastas here are fantastic... salads.... veggies... meatballs.... not one thing I have had here is terrible.   The best thing I have had here is the salted caramel dessert.  It is out of this world delicious!   You must try it!     This is one of my favorite places in the US.... its really that good!\n",
      "My fiancé and I held our rehearsal dinner in the private room upstairs and it was Fantastic! The room was beautiful and the food was delicious. We worked with Jess to coordinate our event over the past year and she was the absolute best - always easy to communicate with and answer our questions. She made sure the planning of and the event itself went smoothly.   We opted for the 3 course seated dinner and everyone was raving about the food. The menu: Starters served family style:  1. Sheep's milk ricotta 2. Roasted beet salad 3. Stuffed  meatballs 4. Seared shrimp Entree choices 1. Pumpkin carbonara  2. Short rib  3. Chicken Saltimbocca  4. Sunday gravy  Dessert choices  1. Salted Caramel budino 2. Seasonal bread pudding  3. Tiramisu   All of the food looked amazing and like I said our guests were raving about all of it. I would highly recommend having your next private event at Barbuzzo!!\n",
      "Absolutely great place to enjoy modern and classic Italian cuisine in authentic atmosphere.  Food is so good  I didn't have moment to snap a picture  but I did get the dessert :) All courses were good:  Burrata salad with roasted carrot  then pappardelle with zucchini and cheese  and grand finale - tiramisu plus white chocolate gelato  and if not enough  added blackberry-bergamot tea sorbet... Simply Yum!\n",

      "Just went here for restaurant week lunch. One word.. YUM! Probably the happiest and most satisfied I've been with a meal during restaurant week.  It was the first restaurant week experience where I really had no idea what to choose because everything looked so appealing. Every menu item spoke to me. Good thing I went with friends! We all decided to get something different and get smaller plates so we could just share everything we ordered. For appetizers  the soup was hearty and complexly herbalicious and the vegetable antipasti made you smile. The ricotta appetizer I would definitely order again. I dare say I'd go back just to get that cheese. It's smooth like butter cream. My goodness. Get it. And you'll find out. I could just eat that and I'd be happy.  For entrees we ordered the chicken saltimbocca  the salsiccia pizza  and the sicilian style bronzino. The sizes were perfect. Actually the pizza was larger than I had anticipated. It was the size of a regular medium pizza and came with fresh oregano (on the twig!) and pepper oil.  The desserts were pretty awesome. I would have chosen the usual tiramisu but decided to live life on the wild side and try the budino. If you love salted caramel this dessert was made for you. My comrades  on the other hand  had never even heard of salted caramel and did not like the new concept. Don't worry about them  they're boring.  One good tip I learned from their website. Make a reservation. If you don't you can only sit at the counter or the bar. To sit at the big people's tables you have to have a reservation  so go on open table for that.\n",
      "This restaurant is located in one of my favorite spots in the city. My friends and I ordered the cheese board  Asparago Pizza (a MUST)  Margherita Pizza (average)  Fava and Preserved Lemon Arancini (very good)  Casarecce Pasta (eh  could have done without) and of course  BUDINO! I am still craving the Asparago Pizza. I cannot wait to come back for another serving and to try out more menu items.\n",
      "My friends and I came here to celebrate a birthday.  It was a great venue to have a small get together.  Food is decent--maybe not worth how much we paid for it.  However  we talked about it  and we agreed this is the type of restaurant you come for the ambiance.  We sat outside  and it was a fun and cute experience.\n",
      "This is one of my friend's favorite restaurants of all time  and I've been here twice with her  both for restaurant week. The deal itself was amazing-- $20 for a three-course lunch--  so I have absolutely nothing to complain about. Barbuzzo is on 13th street  which is lined with great intimate restaurants owned under the same umbrella company (others include some of my favorite of all time  Jamonera and Lolita). The waitservice was so polite and did not bother us excessively  yet our waters were always filled  and I didn't even mind sitting 5 inches away from the next table because the space is conducive to intimacy and a great time with a small group of friends.  I ordered the famous ricotta sheep cheese  which came with perfectly toasted bread  and used it to scrape the plate! The cheese was so smooth and creamy  yet not too heavy. The second course I ordered was a sausage rigatoni  which could have been made vegetarian. The portion was small  but surprisingly filling  I especially enjoyed the roasted tomatoes but thought the pasta itself was a bit salty  probably from the sausage and sauce on top of that. Finally  my last course was the budino  which I enjoyed because I love caramel  but my friends said it was too much and scraped it off. The layer of chocolate cookie on the bottom was delicious though  so make sure each spoonful reaches the bottom of the jar!!\n",
      "I'll make this short and sweet.    Small place  good wines by the glass (have the pino noir)  good service and great location.    I had the gnocchi (must have)  ricotta and figs (second favorite) and the meatballs (too much oregano  a bit salty but still tasty).  All three of those dishes are good to share with another partner.  However  I would have the gnocchi and not sure if I had a choice.  If i could repeat that dinner 10 times over  I wouldn't mind.\n",
      "There is absolutely nothing wrong with this restaurant  and I quite like the decor.  But for the price  I want outstanding food and impeccable service and this has neither. The atmosphere is also a bit zoo like.  It feels to me like a place where people from NJ and out of town go to when they want to feel like they are eating in a classy joint in the city.  My Lyonnaise had delicious dressing.  But the egg was really small and the yolk not runny or big enough to saturate the tiny hidden cubes of potatoes  so it didn't really come together the way a Lyonnaise should.  The skate wing was perfectly fine.  It came with lovely bits of artichoke heart that were fresh and hearty tasting.  I wish the brown butter were more delectable and something I wanted to sop up with my pieces of skate  but not the case.  Also  our waiter was very hesitant  standing at the side of the table never asking if we want to order.  He cleared our silverware after the first course and our second course arrived presumably hot but with no silverware for us to eat it.  We had to flag him down and when he brought silverware it was only for three settings not four  so again we had to wait to all start digging in.  It really is the small things that matter and this place lacked attention to detail.   I would be happy with this quality of food were it in a small corner restaurant that didn't charge as much.  But with all the fuss and attitude about this place  they need to step up the quality.\n",
      "great place for brunch!  portions on certain dishes are out of control (like the french toast and pancakes).  other dishes are more sensible (like the poached eggs and asparagus i had).  the decor is quintessential french bistro  with a little naughty twist that was fun.  other than the waiter forgot to bring us bread (which is necessary for my egg dish!)  and being little brusque with us  parc is a great place for tasty food and a leisurely brunch on a sunday morning.\n",
      "My fiance loves French food  so for her birthday I made a reservation here and we went after seeing how busy it gets on a daily basis and from the previous reviews.    To start the bread was fine  nothing to write home about and not as great as the bread you get at any restaurant in France.    We ordered the duck and lamb.  Both dishes were extremely over priced for what we received.  The portions were also very small and we both left hungry.  With small portions it should be all about the taste and meh they were okay.  Nothing special.  I've had better duck in the chinatown area of philadelphia for 1/20th the price.  Also  the lamb was not warm and we both felt that we make better lamb shank at home.    We left disappointed and will likely not go back.\n",
      "Delicious food  great ambiance  excellent service. My girlfriend had never had French food before and I'm glad this was her first time  because now she'll definitely want to get French food again.   It was a very busy time  on a Friday night  but our waiter was still very attentive. He got our drinks and brought us over a fresh variety of bread.  The entire time  the staff made sure that our water glasses were full.  We got escargot with hazelnut butter to start. I was a little on edge because I imagined a sweet taste to it and I'm not a fan savory and sweet mixes  but it was not sweet at all and absolutely delicious.   For an entree I got the warm shrimp salad. It was delicious. The shrimp was perfectly seasoned and cooked and the avocado was perfectly ripe. My girlfriend got Steak Frites and her steak was cooked deliciously. She said it was very good and the only thing she would change was she wished the steak wasn't as seasoned  but the piece I tried was great!   For dessert we got creme brule  which was also very delicious.  My taste buds left super happy!  Our bill was $103 before tip. I thought this was a great price considering it was more of an upscale restaurant.  For 2 alcoholic beverages  an appetizer  2 great meals  and a dessert  I think this price was great!   I will definitely go back when I visit philly again!\n",
      "I met a friend here for lunch and was disappointed for a bunch of reasons. It was crowded and noisey.  The staff was ok  but not anything special.  I really did not like the menu. It had very few items that were not full of carbs  full of cheese  and full of calories. I like a good meal  but want some healthy options. I couldn't find them at Parc.  I won't go back  and I won't recommend it to my friends.\n",
      "I came through late Tuesday morning on the prowl for eggs. Unfortunately I had just missed morning rush and was seated facing the park-front for an early lunch. It was the usual work crowd with the occasional Rittenhouse passerby  poodle in leash.... I had not anticipated on staying much longer than for a  quick bite  but my server  Christopher's  company was so enjoyable I was easily persuaded to stay longer and enjoy afternoon cocktails on the square. He and his his second in command convinced me to have the croque madame which was absolutely heavenly. This was followed by a series of cocktails (the French Blonde - strong but ladylike  a German white from the Columbia Valley  WA and a fairly new to the menu espresso vodka concoction. Lunch was like therapy on steroids and I look forward to another day of top-notch service at the table to the far right facing out  next Tuesday. :-)\n",

      "Parc is definitely worth every bit of 5 Stars!!!  It was date night for my wife and I.  Upon our arrival it was like you stepped into a european bistro!  You kinda forget that your in the city. The staff was very prompt and helpful. The food was absolutely amazing!!  We left happy and very full. We can not wait to bring some friends back with us so they can experience what we did on our visit!  Thanks Parc for making our first visit a memorable one!  I'll recommend you guys to everyone...\n",
      "This place has all the charm of a European restaurant cafe. I've only been there for the breakfast and brunches  and they are to die for! I've tried almost everything. Even things I wouldn't necessarily like  and ended up falling in love with the food. The wait staff is gracious  never had a problem.\n",
      "I've done some crazy things for food before and waiting in line for over 30 minutes for a cheesesteak is probably one of them.  I was glad that Jim's Steak has their a/c on because it would've been horrific if there weren't any. The line takes about 30 minutes from the door to the front counter where you order. The guys behind the glass cooks the steaks right in your face so you know it's fresh and hot. I went for the classic  Cheesesteak wiz wit  which includes the steak  cheese wiz  and onions.   The sandwich by itself was a bit bland for me but good amount of steak and tasty onions. I had to put some mayo and ketchup (don't judge me!) to bring up the flavor a bit.   Was it worth the wait for me? Not really  but I'm glad I got to try it out and be the judge of it myself.\n",

      "If I didn't have to wait 30 minutes to get the food  this would've gotten 4 stars. If the line is at the front door  that's how long you wait  a freakin' half hour. That out of the way  the cheesesteak was actually juicy  not dry like another spot across the street. Decent price  but over hyped\n",
      "#1 cheesesteak in Philly!  We spent the day testing various \\best cheesesteaks\\\" around the city and Jims was our número uno!  The place is extremely efficient  so know what you want before you get to the front of the line. No more than 30 seconds to place order  pay  receive food. The staff were very nice and playful.   Now why #1? Well seasoned steak packed to brim  caramelized onions  and cheese wiz that melts throughout and produces a perfectly juicy bite! Personal preference from a girl that loves cheese  add a mix of cheese to ensure you get the gooey cheese and runny deliciousness!  Final tips: -cash only -come on off hours to avoid the lines\"\n",

      "I suppose you can't go to Philly without at least trying one of their famous cheese steaks. Not knowing any differences among all the cheese steak restaurants  we decided on Jim's. I've got to say  it was no big deal. The sandwich was good  mind you  but now that I've had one  I'm ready to move on. Ordering was a bit confusing (not as simple a menu as I expected) and the guys behind the counter weren't especially helpful and didn't seem too eager to make sure we enjoyed our visit. The place was a bit greasy and dingy  but that's to be expected in a downtown diner. All in all  I'm glad we did it  but won't be rushing back.\n",

      "Our first cheesecake in the city...not bad but not the best. They put their cheese wiz on top of the bread first  then the meat etc which leaves the meat on top dry and not much flavor to it. On the west coast we have phillys best and the put their cheese atop the meat which is the best!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "By far one of the better cheesesteak places in Philly. I think I may have found my favorite one thus far  but need to explore a whole lot more.\n",
      "I've had about 5 different steaks in Philly  including Genos  Pats  Jims.  This is by far the best. I've had the regular steak   the chicken steak and the Buffalo chicken steak.  All are great.  I prefer the chicken with provolone. Very courteous staff  always nice even when there's a line 20 people  deep. Seating is limited and the restaurant is very narrow. There is some seating outside  but you cannot order it to go and take it out there.\n",
      "Really good food. The cheesesteaks are worth the wait. Very crowded  so I recommend ordering \\to-go\\\" and eating elsewhere. On nice days  eating outside looks like fun. Good experience overall.\"\n",
      "Prob my favorite in Philly. Whiz wit.   Super fast  reasonable price  nothing else to say.\n",
      "Been going to D'Als since high school  maybe even before that. Always on my list of places to hit up when I'm back in Philly.\n",
      "I feel this place is over rated. $60 for a family to eat cheesesteak was crazy.  We got our order and it was wrong  you had to yell to order  people were getting yelled at to come inside and shut the door. It was nuts. When we got our food we didn't get anything that we ordered and couldn't ask for what we needed because  it was chaos. Ginos  is better.  Def. Wont be back.\n",
      "The food is great. The people are not. The manager has a popular restaurant and he knows it. My wife and I went to Green Eggs early. The place was about half full but we were told there is a short wait...for a table for two. My wife is 8 1 2 months pregnant. We waited outside for about 20 minutes. During that time we saw three parties of two get seated before us.  They were not on the waiting list. The restaurant had outdoor tables but we were not offered them. We were told that we could go inside and order to go since we couldn't wait any longer. At the to-go counter we were told that any to-go order would take an additional 20-30 minutes. We left and had breakfast elsewhere  with no wait and the food was just as good. They also accepted cards. The food at Green Eggs is good  but for me it's not worth having to deal with smug waitstaff. The manager needs training  and a personality transplant.\n",
      "Fun  healthy and popular. Great cafe for brunch lunch!\n",
      "\n",
      "Green Eggs never disappoints! We have been here for brunch roughly 3-4 times and we're always impressed with the quality of the food. It's always consistently good  portioned well and tastes great.   This time around we had guests from Canada so we wanted to take them to the best brunch spot. We ordered the velvet pancakes to share as a table(it's massive) then we got beef short rib bennies  chicken and waffles bennies and creme brûlée French toast. All we're cooked to perfection! I'm not usually a beef person but their beef short rib bennies blew my mind.   Our guest wanted to come back to try new menu items. We will definitely be back!\n",
      "Would have given five stars but our waitress was sub par. Loved everything we ordered maple oatmeal  strawberry waffles  Oreo and nf latte. Full bar! Perfect meal before seeing a matinee. The best part is that it's a green restaurant ECO FRIENDLY  which uses local produce and REASONABLY LOW PRICES. Another reason to go to the theater.\n",

      "SERVICE - 0 1) Waiting area - Non-existent      For a restaurant that consistently anticipates an influx of customers  they have done absolutely nothing to accommodate for the wait. Ironically  they close down a section of the restaurant during the week. We were waiting in line with others outside on the street in the heat for more than 45 minutes. When I asked if we could be seated at the empty tables  we were told that area was only for weekends  or special bookings. Funny enough  they don't take reservations. It blows my mind that they basically take pride in seeing a number of their customers \\work\\\" for their seat here. It's almost like a sadistic significant other making you jump through as many hoops as possible to see how much you want them.   2) Waiter - This place is ridiculously understaffed     - forgot about us for a good 20 minutes after seating us     - forgot to bring our red velvet pancakes until we were almost done with our meal  and had to remind another waiter about them.   FOOD - 1 I moved to Philly 2 years ago  and the taste has significantly deteriorated.  1) Red Velvet Pancakes - dry/ crumbly  with a bit too much aftertaste of food coloring.  2) Kitchen sink - they forgot to add any salt at all.  3) Nutella Latte - there was absolutely nothing nutella about it. It was watered down bland coffee with some dilute coco taste to it. I am pretty sure my little nephews have made me a better mocha just by giving me their chocolate milk and adding coffee to it.   Finally  I saw a roach by the ATM that stands next to the bar area. So...buh bye Green eggs.\"\n",
      "Awesome food but... - Took 10 minutes to get our coffee after waiting in line for 25  - No one carries cash anymore.  I guess maybe some of the hipsters in the neighborhood carry old world coin purses or some crap but none of the rest of us have $40 on hand. You don't want to pay the charges huh cafe?? So why not pass that charge on to us  right?  - They would have still gotten 4 stars though  had it not been for the nonsense on our bill.  So their portions are huge which is awesome but you'll most likely have leftovers...also great. But be conservative with how many boxes you need because THEY CHARGE YOU FOR A TAKE OUT BOX!!!!!!!!!!  What comic book villain money balled this place?? Who the f**k has the balls to charge for a to go box? It's only $.0.25 but that makes it even worse.  What are you an airline? How much for your napkins or to \\rent\\\" your plates?  I'm spending $3 for an ATM charge and you're charging me a quarter for a box?  Your margins are that thin?\"\n",
      "I was happy to hear that Dim Sum Garden has moved to a superior location.  The new restaurant has a much improved ambience.  I especially like the modern stone walls decorated with the artsy photographs of Shanghai.  Although this is a new location  the food is still authentic and top notch.  My favorites are the soup dumplings and the crispy pan fried juicy dumplings or buns.  These dumplings are like the ones I have eaten in Shanghai that were highly recommended.  The service is friendly and efficient.  The manager is professional and takes pride in the quality of the food.  This is a worthwhile and unique dining experience for those on a modest budget.  I have eaten at the new location three times and will definitely return.\n",
      "Came here on a Thursday night with a friend for dinner. She raved about it so I was excited to try the food. I think I've been to the place before but at its previous location?  We had the chicken and broccoli which was delicious (but still like my mom's version better) and the pork soup dumplings. They were yummy and fun to eat.   Place was clean with cute decor on the walls. Ambience was nice as well. It was dim and had a great vibe for a lowkey date or dinner with close friends. I would definitely come back here whenever I'm in Chinatown.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my first time to give a restaurant only one star.   If you are American  maybe you would like this place because the updated decoration and the relatively clean environment comparing with other Chinese restaurants. However  the food is terrible.   I happened to sit at the table where you can see what's going on in the kitchen. As far as I observe  all the food is pre-made or frozen. They are NOT fresh! I saw the chef in the kitchen took a piece of scallion pancake from the refrigerator  which from  the package you can tell it's the frozen scallion pancake you can get from supermarket. Then the chef took a small bowl of mapo tofu from refrigerator  he heated it in the microwave  2 mins later  mapo tofu is served....  I don't know why this place is so packed especially on weekend. The service is ok  the food is horrible  besides the food are all pre-made/frozen  they add MSG in every dish.   The only good thing about this restaurant is the price is reasonable  but hey  you are eating frozen food  how much you would pay for it?\n",
      "Okay for the first time  keep in mind that it is cash only! Im a vegetarian and wanted to try new things so i asked about the vegetarian duck- that sounds off and should have been a no from the start. It was a combination of chewy  yet kindof slimy since theres mushrooms in it... And it was VERY cold for being on a cold dish list on the menu. The vegetable noodles were only okay  and needed alot more salt because i felt there was no flavor at all. However  the servers were very nice  and despite all the commotion i do not think i will be coming back here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dim sum garden totally lived up to the hype. Quick service  cash only  BYO  affordable  great food. Total wait time was less than 10 min on a Sunday evening.  The Mapo tofu. 20/10. And no  that's not a typo. This is definitely the best dish I had tonight. It can be ordered alone to share with the group or over rice or noodles to make it a meal for one. Also have the option to add pork for the meat lovers. The pan fried chicken dumplings and red bean paste buns were a hit too.  Now  the vegetarian soup dumplings - definitely a misnomer because there was no soup to be found inside my dumplings!! Sorry vegetarians  on we go hunting for those perfect vegetarian soup dumplings. Also wasn't a huge fan of the Kung pao chicken over noodles either.   Overall  so much food - all for less than 35$. Amazing!!\n",
      "\n",
      "So cheap  so yummy  plus BYOB! Love coming here with my boyfriend or with groups of friends! During the week it is usually pretty easy to get seating  but on the weekend you will have to wait a little. The service is always on point  so they move through people pretty quickly. They have plenty of options of dumplings and then regular and Americanized Chinese food (ie. General Tso's). So there is something for everyone!   WARNINGS: I've been before when they didn't ID for alcohol  but I think they recently have started to ID check  so beware of that you young-ins! Also  cash only  there's an ATM inside.\n",
      "A beautiful  cozy  warm atmosphere. The food is outstanding and the service excellent. A delightful menu. I recommend to try.\n",
      "We only came for teatime  so I can't really rate the food or the dining rooms (which I hear are very cool)  but I did attend with a Brit  so I can give you an authenticity rating.  The Brit says that it's not \\authentic\\\" per se  but it's a lovely homage to a British pub - not tacky in the least.  Based on my slightly more limited experience  I'd have to agree.  The drinks (Pimms deluxe  awesome!) were great  the tea was reportedly good too  and I really enjoyed the salmon-and-trout paté.  The place was pretty cozy too  but although I was seated next to the fireplace  still chilly.\"\n",
      "Great atmosphere . Had the cheese plate and pork tenderloin will definitely go back to explore the tasty menu some more. They could expand on the desert menu though  it didnt really have anything worth trying. Ok beer selection.\n",
      "a little loud at the beginning - i lost my voice trying to tell a story.  and ended up standing while waiting for a table since the bar area on the first floor was crowded.  and the service is very nice - it is just hard some times to get their attention (we ordered wine to eat with our mains and it didnt come until we were finished).  but the food was good - got the scallops and the burger.  the fries are fresh and HUGE.  the drink with pimms is also yummy - and the bartender was super accommodating and let me sub vodka for the gin.\n",
      "I was instantly sold on this place the minute I walked in the doors and the whiffs of smells hit my nose.  As we were seated and given the drink menu I was brought back to my time in England and thinking I was at a free house.    The service was great  taken care of instantly even if there was not a seat left in the place.  The food was brought out quickly and was wonderful.  I have been told the deviled eggs are very good  well that is an understatement.  The meal was even better.  I cannot wait for my return to Philly just so I can come back.\n",
      "Fantastic food  decor  ambiance. The ricotta spread is Amazing. The tandoori chicken was phenomenal. The fish and burger were also on point. Spend your money here. Small menu but quality is priority to the establishment. No complaints.\n",
      "The Cheese plate   Scottish Salmon and the Basil Punnett were delicious. Loved the atmosphere and decor  too! Will definitely be back.\n",
      "We were in Philly for a Phillies game and stayed overnight.  The Dandelion was a tremendous part of our Philly experience.  Great decor and service.  We just walked around the rest of the day saying  \\God  that was so good\\\"!  We had the Chicken Duck Liver appetizer which we weren't sure we'd like but our waiter said it was his favorite.  So glad we dared to try something new!  It was delicious.  We all shared the Fish and Chips  Hot Roast Beef Sandwich  and French Toast (best we'd all ever had!!).  We even went on and on about the watercress salad that came with the sandwich.  Excellent in every way.  Couldn't recommend more!\"\n",
      "Before I start my review  I must mention that I am bothered by the name of this place  it doesn't have the right British Pub feel to me.  So for the rest of this review I will refer to it as \\The Dandy Lion Pub\\\". Which I find to be so much more pleasing than a bar named after a weed that I don't even think exists in England...  I have a tip for anyone trying to get into this place: that super cool door on the corner of 18th and Sansom? Not the actual door.  I felt like a fool tugging on it  only to find out the real door looks like a side entrance on 18th.  Anyways  the decor in the Dandy Lion was somewhat odd  but enjoyable. As I waited for my friends to arrive  I sat near the fireplace in what felt like some old man's living room. I was afraid to touch anything until someone on the staff came over and told me it actually was for sitting not just looking (it resembles the random furniture you see thrown into some museums  with ropes in front of the display telling you not to sit). Side note: the staff here is fantastic: super nice  helpful  and very cheerful but laid back. We sat upstairs in a very homey feeling sun room which i just loved.  I could sit up there all day.   I came here for brunch and was really pleased with the menu. I find most brunch menus to be very overwhelming  with way too many options. There was a nice range of choices but not so much that I couldn't choose a meal. I went for the Eggs Royale and they were fantastic. Just the right amount of Hollandaise and smoked salmon  and really well cooked eggs. The coffee was really delicious but heads up  its like $3.50 (a bit steep if you ask me).   Also  the bar area looks lovely. I can't wait to find an excuse to come here for happy hour!\"\n",
      "Stephen Starr has done it again!  Dandelion is AWESOME from the food to the best ambiance I've experienced in Center City.  I really cannot wait to go back to the dog bar upstairs or sit by the fireplace downstairs  if I am lucky enough to snag a spot there.  There are several levels of the restaurant.  It feels really intimate in each space  which has its own design and layout.  I believe that this is pretty authentic based on my one trip to the UK a few years ago.  But honestly - knowing that Great Britain is not exactly known for its food - the ambiance is the only thing that this place has in common with its inspiration!  But I digress.  Major ambiance highlights include wood-burning fireplaces  which are a treasure during winter months  and the dog bar upstairs  with tons of photos and statues of dogs.  The furniture is all old-school - lots of wood  wooden tables  chairs and paneling.  Check out the room upstairs painted in off-white with a bay window overlooking 18th street and a beautiful light fixture...it looked very appealing and warm in there.  The food was great and the service was very friendly and welcoming.  It was crowded in there but they sat us within 20 minutes or so (no problem  I rocked some Pinot Noir while we waited).  PS - looks like a fun beer selection here.  Here's what we ordered:  -deviled eggs - nice curry flavor  but not overpowering at all.  MMM!  -butter lettuce salad - lightly dressed with apples  bleu cheese  pomergranite seeds...why is butter lettuce so good?  -fois gras - I don't usually order it.  Came with an egg  thick-cut bacon and balsamic reduction = one tasty bite!  -NY Strip - OUT OF CONTROL GOOD...comes with two sauces  one was a little creamy and one was a rich bbq-esque flavor.  This steak DEFINITELY rivals ALL steak houses I've been to in Center City BY FAR.  I could not get enough of this steak.  That is all I have to say.  -Roasted organic chicken - I don't usually order chicken out but this is the place to get it...came on potatoes  I caught a taste of turnips  roasted baby carrots...simple  delicious  hearty.  Next snow day you can find me at the fireplace in Dandelion.\n",
      "From the pulled pork to the hot peppers to the provolone cheese to the rolls  everything is top notch. The slow cooked pork is seasoned and marinated perfectly. This sandwich is worth the wait if there is a line.  Easily the best sandwich in Reading Terminal Market.\n",
      "The best Italian style pulled pork!  Is you are in the Reading Market  you have to have one!\n",
      "Quick tip: While in line  scout for diners finishing up their meals and ask for their seats. We did that  and were fed within ten minutes.\n",
      "I'm in bandwagon-jumping rather than contrarian mode here. You'll want the roast pork  provolone and greens  an incredibly juicy and flavorful concoction. They have earned huge crowds but do a good job of moving the line quickly.\n",
      "Simply the best sandwich that Philadelphia has to offer. The roast pork sandwich is the cheesesteak's cooler  better looking brother and Tommy DiNic's does it better than anyone. I never return home without hitting their counter in the Terminal.\n",
      "\n",
      "This should be on your \\100 things to do before you die\\\" list. For less than $10 you will have on of the best sandwiches of your life. I recommend the roast pork with sharp provolone and greens.   It will be sloppy  juicy  garlicky  served without a smile in a brown paper bag  cardiologist-unapproved  and one of the best sandwiches you will ever eat.   For out-of-towners: the Reading Terminal Market is a great place to visit for lunch. Scout out a spot to eat before getting in line otherwise you'll have a soggy bag full of pork mess by the time you get a seat. Worth the wait!\"\n",
      "I can't stop telling my friends about how Dinic's makes the best sandwich I've ever tasted in my life.  Roast pork + sharp provo + broccoli rabe  Not a combination you'd expect but wow  do they go well together. So good that I would go back to Philly JUST for this sandwich. The cheesesteaks have nothing on this!\n",
      "Came here on a Sunday morning. We ordered pork  sharp provolone & hot pepper. Very good quality sandwich. No frills. Meat  peppers  cheese  bread. I think they used a garlic Parmesan spread on the bread. The portion was good and the employees served your food and went about their business. When I'm back in Philly it'll be worth trying another meat option. The bread was good and held up without being too hard.\n",
      "Tommy DiNic's is no joke. I've been to this spot a few times and have very much become a creature of habit. They are known for their roast pork with provolone and broccoli rabe  and there is a dam good reason. It is the ish  times time  times a hundred  times a thousand!  First  the bread they use is perfect. But you soon forget  because the contents are so mouth watering. I get like Cujo and salivate every time one of these bad boys gets popped into my belly.  Reading Terminal has a number of good spots  but this is really The Spot. This is where you need to make a bee line to if you want to take in the best of Reading Terminal. Anything else is selling yourself short of a great experience.\n",
      "Great place to grab a cheap lunch!    I would totally get their duck noodle soup since the duck is soft and flavorful.  The beef noodle soup was somewhat standard.  You can order with hand cut noodles  which are like thick  slivers of thicker  chewy dough  or your standard round noodles.  Their dumplings were delicious  fried  I got an order to go!  Their noodles in peanut sauce is really good too!  I will get that again.\n",
      "Delicious dumps. I had the beef brisket noodle soup that was great. My friend had the sliced chicken noodle soup but the chicken was pretty bland. Definitely try the beef or another menu item over this.   Huge serving sizes (but you should still get the dumplings to start with anyway)  We went on a Friday afternoon at 3pm so very quiet which of course meant short waiting time and good service.\n",
      "Can't beat the cheap prices.  Roasted duck soup was good.  The handmade noodles really makes the meal.  The food came out really quick too.\n",
      "Cheap hand drawn noodles. Broth is solid. I opted for the beef brisket and my friend had the house special meat ball. We both have no idea what's in the meatball  but it kind of has the consistency of tofu. Not a fan of the meatballs lol.  The ratings speak for themselves. $8 for authentic hand drawn noodles  can't get much better than that.  Cash only and service is non-existent. ATM is outside at the entrance and charged $1.75.\n",
      "One of my favorite comfort foods to get a nice hot bowl of braised beef noodle soup ~   We were seated immediately and the only strange thing about our meal was that my noodle soup came out before even the appetizer came out  but i didnt complain!!  We ordered the stir fry beef noodle dish  the scallion pancake  and the braised beef noodle soup (both noodle dishes with shaved noodles instead of hand drawn)  The stir fry beef noodle dish was flavorful and not too salty. Had a good portion of beef in there as well  The braised beef noodle soup was soul warming but sometimes you get that extra spice kick in. Although the menu says spicy  it's not so spicy that you can't enjoy your meal and theres plenty of tender beef in the soup as well. I love the fresh cilantro on top and the white radish soaks up alll of the flavors.. nom nom nom  Scallion pancake had the perfect dipping sauce but i think the pancake itself was a little bland for me.  Our total came to $24 so definitely an affordable and very filling meal thatll warm your bones\n",
      "Authentic noodles that are clearly hand-made. My favorite dish to order is the sliced noodles  beef stir fried. Chewy  flavorful  and delicious with a great sauce. The appetizers are not as mentioned as much as their noodles  but are actually fantastic as well and tops what I've had in other restaurants nearby. The scallion pancake in particular is amazing and crispy savory.\n",
      "Cold days and Nan Zhou soups - the French would call this un mariage parfait.  I am totally addicted to these quality noodles and their chewy  toothy consistency  be they in soups  sauces  or stir-fried.    Spicy Pig Ears is a must appetizers (don't give me that surprised \\eek\\\"!) - pretty  flowing ribbons doused in chili oil  resting on a bed of cool daikon radish salad - a spicy ode to porcus maximus  great in texture and taste.  Peanut noodles: must have a shaved noodle and hand drawn noodle version at the same time to appreciate the difference in texture.  Another appetizer I like is shredded kelp  with its taste reminiscent of ocean.  You can count on the familiar dishes like snow pea tips  spinach with garlic  etc. to be reliantly good but slurping more noodles from a big bowl full of one of the many different types of soups (beef  beef brisket  ox tail  roast pork and even more interesting ingredients for the more adventurous eaters) is a special pleasure.  Coming with a group of friends allows for tasting many different dishes.  The bill will always be very low.  Service is efficient and friendly (with some exceptions)  the restaurant bright and comfortable.  Go try!\"\n",
      "These are the most amazing noodles EVER. I'm from NYC but have yet to find anything that even comes close here. Ever since my friend introduced me to Nan Zhou Noodle House four years ago  I insist that we come here every time I visit her in Philly. The noodles are my main motivation to go to Philly  but shhhh  don't tell my friend that =)   They have two types of noodles  which they make at the restaurant: hand-drawn (like spaghetti) and shaven (wide flat noodles). I prefer the beef brisket noodle soup with shaven noodles. You can also add an fried egg into your soup  which is pretty tasty. The broth is so homey and delicious. They also have dry noodles but I think the soup is better. The proportions are HUGE so it's hard to even come close to finishing it. On top of that  it's SO cheap. If you're feeling adventurous  I would also recommend starting with the beef tendon on top of pickled radish.   This place is a must try and worth the trip (from NY) to Philly. It's THAT good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delicious food at the super cheap price you would hope for. Try the shaved noodles with peanut sauce! banging.   I usually go and stuff my face for about 6 bucks.\n",
      "Ugh. The last few times I've left this place  I've left annoyed. The hostesses and the bartenders are rude. Really terrible attitudes consistently. I will not go back.  Can get the same fries and mussels at their other location in fairmount minus the attitudes.\n",
      "This was my first trip to the famous Monk's.  What anticipation!  The beer variety did not disappoint.  Maybe my expectations were too high but all other aspects of the place were only fair.  I was there for lunch.  Maybe it is better for dinner.  The place is dark and narrow.  I looked online so knew the menu in advance.  I had mussels.  Good  but I have had better.  Only the front bar was open and the bartender did not want to talk about the taps in the back room.  He was knowledgeable about beer but that is the only positive that I could give him.  I asked for a particular beer and he had to go to the basement to get one.  He came back with a different beer and poured it without asking me first.  When I noticed the bottle and asked what he did  he brushed it off as no big deal because he knew it was just as good and cheaper.  The substituted beer was good but that is unacceptable behavior by a bartender. Maybe Monk's is better with a different bartender.  Maybe  maybe  maybe.  Maybe Monk's is riding on its rep.  Maybe I will not go back.\n",
      "I love this place  the mussels are amazing and the mac and cheese is so good! I usually go to the back bar  and the bartender back there is great! There's always great beers on tap and the staff is knowledgeable and make great suggestions. Yummy  thinking about Monk's makes me want to eat there right now.... Guess I know what I'm doing tonight!\n",
      "My only complaint with Monk's is that it's popular. It's a Philadelphia institution  they've been pouring Belgian beer before you could find it on a map and long before you could tell the different between a dubbel  trippel  and quad. Great beer selection divided up between the front and back bar. Love the food. If I could reliably get a table or a place at the bar I'd be here all the time.\n",
      "I've had many  many great nights at this Philly staple. Writing this review makes me wish I was there right now settling in with some friends  ordering some fine beers and a couple pots of mussels on a crisp November night. The beer selection is the #1 draw. The draft list is always changing but if you are into IPAs  barley wines  belgian blondes and then like  there's always something for you. I remember going once and seeing Pliny The Elder on tap and being particularly delighted. The bartenders themselves are seasoned vets and they know their stuff. They're also incredibly friendly and easy going.  When the place gets busy  and it does get busy and noisy  it just feels vibrant  never chaotic. There's a great energy there. I'm giving this place 5 stars because it's a long-time favorite of mine and it never disappoints.\n",
      "the only reason i gave monks a single star is because the mussels are decent.    the staff is rude and acts as if you are privileged to merely be in their company  the service from the moment we walked was miserable.  the consensus of our party was that nobody had ever been treated so poorly eating out before.   there are plenty of other places in the area to grab a excellent beer - i suggest trying one as you stroll past monks.\n",

      "We arrived around 9pm on a Friday night and the four of us were seated in minutes and spent about 3 hours at our table ordering food and drinks.  These may be the best mussels that I have had in Philly. The small pot was huge so I can't even imagine what the large pot must be like. The 4 of us split 3 small pots of mussels and 2 sandwiches and were stuffed. The mussels also come with a side of bread and French fries. The Portobello sandwich was good  but I think their burgers are even better. They also have a decent beer menu. The 4 of us had 3 pots of mussels  2 sandwiches and countless beers over a 3 hour period and our bill came to about $160  and we left very full and satisfied. Service was decent.  They do need to fix their bathroom sink because the cold water faucet did not work at all.\n",
      "For Belgian brews and tasty pub food  it doesn't get any better in Philly than Monk's.  Monk's has a great atmosphere--dark  wood-paneled walls smattered with Belgian beer paraphernalia and old woven tapestries  with a great indie/rock soundtrack to boot.  But really  you come to Monk's for the beer.  They have their own branded Flemish Sour Ale brewed for them that is bomb.  The Sour Ale is a MUST  and should be your first drink of the night. Always.  The tap list is always rotating but never disappoints.  Monk's does a great job of carrying some solid Belgian gems like Tripel Karmeliet  while also mixing in seasonal flavors  IPAs  and a few heavier beers.  The Monk's beer guide is worth a look for kicks  but the tap list is so great than I've never found myself wanting anything bottled.  For the non-beer enthusiasts  you can often find lambics that will satisfy.  The bar is pretty weak in terms of liquor  but that's not their wheelhouse.  Prices are rather high but won't kill you  especially if you're having fewer servings of boozier beers.  Food is great  but good luck getting a table until late night.  Odds are great that you'll be standing with your drinks until a bar stool or two open up--totally worth it for the the Monk's experience.\n",
      "3rd time's the charm! Wait  actually  every time has been a charm!  I am absolutely in love with Jose Garces restaurant  but Amada is definitely my favorite! (A little bit sad that I didn't get to try Chifa before it closed)...  FOOD: 5/5 -Definitely start with a mixto of either cheese or cured meat. I'm a huge fan of cheeses so that's what I went  but wow  the cured meat platter next to us look so tempting! I went with the manchego (loved the lavender honey)  ermesenda  and garrotxa  the garrotxa itself is a bit bland  but with the garlic dulce de leche  it was magical! all in all  there is no cheese you can go wrong with if you're a cheese lover! -Gazpacho - one of my favorite here  love the fresh factor  and yellow tomato is always so interesting. It's just so rightly chilled and slightly sour. Great appetizer! -Tortilla Espanola - my girlfriend loved it  but it was a bit of \\potato overload\\\" for me! -Albondigas - a classic tapas dish for me here  definitely a must! -Gambas al Ajillo - pan seared shrimp if I'm correct. It's definitely good but not to die for. Sprayed with lemon juice on top so it's definitely refreshing -Alcachofas y setas - read that the wild mushrooms were delicious so we gave this a try. If we weren't so darn full by now it would've been amazingly scrumptious. Regardless  definitely a dish worth trying! -Crema catalan - I don't want to sound crude but isn't it just creme brulee? Good  but didn't like the dates on there. Also  you get a FREE almond cookie! It's good enough of a dessert itself!  AMBIANCE & SERVICE: 5/5 Love the design of the restaurant  this didn't change since my last dinner. Service has been amazing the past two times. I was unfortunate to arrive a bit more than 20 minutes late  and with a call to the restaurant ahead of the time  they were willing to hold my table. Thank you! The waiters and waitresses were so nice  and my water glass was never empty (my huge pet peeve!).   RECOMMENDATION Definitely don't get too much. People say tapas are small  but they can fill you up quickly! We got 7 total  including dessert and counting the mixto cheese platter as one instead of three. THAT IS DEFINITELY TOO MUCH! I could barely enjoy the flatbread and dessert because I was so darn full! Also  ditch the dessert and eat the FREE cookie. It's good! When the tab came  I was pleasantly surprised that tip and tax included  it was right under $100  which makes me think this was much more worth it than a date at a steakhouse  and much more appealing. I'd much rather not watch my date chomp over some steak ferociously....ALSO  if you're running a bit late or hitting traffic  give a quick call ahead and they can usually hold your table for up to 20-30 minutes! Just be nice and ask!\"\n",
      "I had been wanting to go to Amada for a long time and I finally go to go this past weekend! My cousins and I split a pitcher of red sangria  which had the perfect ratio of wine and fruit juice. After drinking some sangria  I ordered the Broken Hugs cocktail and found that to be even better than the sangria. We ordered about 8 small plates between the three of us  which ended up being the perfect amount. My favorite dishes were the lamb meatballs  baked goat cheese  and grilled octopus. I would 10 10 recommend Amada whether it is for drinks at the bar or a nice sit down dinner!\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the original tapas restaurants in Philadelphia that continues to produce fine tapas and drinks. For bourbon lovers try the matador. Nicely decorated inside  the restaurant is great for both business and pleasure. Their paella is very good as are their desserts. One of the best restaurants in Old City.\n",
      "My first experience having tapas did not disappoint. I'm so glad it was at Amada. Everything was delicious! I came on a Monday night with my boyfriend for Center City Restaurant Week  and the place was packed. We were seated very quickly (we had a reservation). For the first course  we had Aged Manchego Cheese with truffle lavender honey  Chorizo Blanco  Tortilla Española  and Gambas Al Ajillo. For the second course  we had Coca de Alcachofas Y Setas  A La Plancha: Hanger Steak  Arroz Temporado  and Madre E Hijo . We both got Tocinillo de Cielo for dessert. There wasn't one thing I didn't like--they were all so yummy!\n",
      "Another visit  another hit!  And we had the pleasure of meeting Chef Garces himself!  What a charming  down to earth soul.  By all means  have their signature pork tapa - but know that it takes a good half hour to give the skin that perfect CRUNCH that had us all weak at the knees.  Seriously  if I'm going to up my cholesterol - this is the way to do it!  Food is prepared with a lot of love!  I wasn't too thrilled with the spanish octopus though  it was tough and dry.  But the oysters with strawberries and cava sorbet - what a delight!  That short rib flat bread?  Amazing!  The wagu beef skewer?  Delicioso!  The cheese and charcuterie with some wonderful tempranillo - definitely a great starter!  I can't wait to visit some of his other restaurants.  The place was PACKED on a Tuesday night  and not a single diner seemed unhappy - the food is and was all this iron chef says he offers!  Next time Im bringing friends and we are ordering the cochinillo!  GRACIAS AMADA!\n",
      "This was my first time at Amada and we did \\the pig\\\" -- a definite must! I highly recommend finding 3 or more friends and getting on the list as reservations book up a couple months in advance. They bring the roasted suckling pig tableside to carve -- it's quite the site. The bowls of chick peas with spinach in a red sauce  grilled green onions  roasted fingerling potatoes  and white beans with rosemary that accompany the pig were all delicous. We also started off with a few tapas which I recommend  while waiting (garlic shrimp and a chef's cheese plate selection -- both delicous). I'm also hooked on their wine list -- if you like whites  try the Verdejo!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We came here since a friend recommended it. Luckily we booked ahead And they were very accommodating.  Overall it was a great atmosphere and great for drinks.  The suckling pig was very tasty but it's more of a dish for 6-8 people and comes with sides. Sangria was tasty as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sampan blew me away. The menu is creative and truly celebrates Asian cuisine  with fresh new tweaks to classic dishes and unexpected flavor combinations for the more adventurous diners. The service is a tad on the slow side  but very friendly and helpful  and the prices (~$40 pp with drinks) are surprisingly reasonable.  We stopped by for Sunday dinner without a reservation and luckily were able to grab seats in front of the open kitchen. It was engrossing to watch as each chef executed different dishes with intense precision and speed. Ordering was a challenge because everything on the menu sounded delicious  and everything being cooked in front of us looked and smelled incredible!  We settled on edamame dumplings  pork bao  hamachi crudo  XO sauce chicken wings  and XO sauce scallops (yes  we really like XO sauce). The edamame dumplings came highly recommended by a friend  and they did not disappoint - the dumpling skin was delicate and chewy  the filling was silky and refreshing  and the sake-truffle broth was the perfect accompaniment. The XO sauce chicken wings portion was huge for an appetizer and with their unique blend savory-spicy-sweet crunchiness  are some of the best wings I have ever had. The scallops might have been our favorite dish of the night  though it's hard to pick because everything was so good!   Our only food disappointment was the pork bao  which was so greasy that the bun lost its fluffiness. The drinks were a bit mixed - the One-Inch Punch lacked any strong clementine  strawberry  or lychee flavor (to the point that we're wondering if they just gave us the wrong drink)  while the Chapter II was great. No matter  this is the first time in a while that I have been so excited about a restaurant - there are at least seven other items on the menu that I cannot wait to try.\n",
      "I really only come here for happy hour because it is such a good deal! For food. I don't know about the drinks  I've only had a house red and it was just meh. But the food! They offer a limited menu and everything is under $5. The portions are smaller  but the food is deceptively filling. I tried almost everything on the menu at some time or another and everything is very tasty. If I had to pick a downside  I would say there isn't a lot of room (and I think -- but am not certain -- that happy hour menus apply only to the bar areas) and my clothes smelled like fried food for quite some time after leaving.   The best part is that they offer happy hour every day of the week!\n",
      "When I walked in with the gang  we soon discovered they were booked inside from reservations. The 6-8 (or more) tables were empty  but a reservation is a reservation. We ate outside. One fly  but we had fun. The spicy chicken is delicious. One little accident happened. My friend bumped my glass down  it shattered  and the other people dining all turned to look at us almost simultaneously. Luckily  I smiled and was all \\Yeah. There was a little accident.\\\" Anyway  everyone had a great time. The waitress is lovely. I would say sexy  but I doubt she's around my age. Lol. I recommend going here though.\"\n",
      "Amazing Asian fusion food! The Tofu Tacos and Pea Shoot Truffle Dumplings were bursting with flavor  but I wish they had more vegetarian options. The drinks were awesome too and I would definitely recommend this place to others visiting Philly\n",
      "Super good food and moderately priced. I went here Saturday night to celebrate my birthday  it was pretty busy but good thing we made a reservation. I wanted to sit outside for better lighting because it's pretty dark inside but it's not so comfortable when it's busy. I suggest the counter seating where you can watch them cook the food! I would've sat here if I knew it existed but I didn't notice it till after I finished my food and went inside to go to the bathroom. Other than being too close for comfort to two groups of people (It was a busy Saturday night so what else would you expect)  everything else was good. The food was amazing  which the portions were just a tad bit bigger  so I can savor it some more. The wagyu beef satay was absolutely amazing  the beef was cooked perfectly and the sauce on top which I think was kimchi was amazing. Crab tacos and bao buns were good and so was the Peking duck. One thing I'd pass is the pad Thai  you can get pad Thai like theirs pretty much anywhere so I'd suggest trying something a little more unique.\n",
      "\n",
      "I came for Happy Hour. The happy hour prices for food and drinks are great! It's a little tight inside and pretty busy during that time  but well worth it!!\n",
      "Went there on a saturday night  sneaked in and the hostess got my sister and I table (Already earned 3 stars there!). We sat by the kitchen table in the back which unfortunately made my clothes smell for the rest of the night but also gave me a close eye view on how the food was made!  We ordered lettuce cups  rocky shrimp (is that what it was called.. too busy shoving it down my throat to think)  kimchee fried rice and scallops. let us just say everything was delicious. Coming from an eater from NYC you wouldn't expect a large number of shrimps in an appetizer order but boy we were blown away! Amazing food  the order came out fast and lastly we also had the homemade ice cream as a dessert. we chose vanilla  swedish fish (yes) and honey grahams (even more yes).   amazing. just simply amazing food  ambiance  service and company around us. It's def a hidden gem. I'm very judgement of asian food since my parents own a restuarant and a buffet but this one is very very good. will def come again if I ever am in Philly again.\n",
      "Okay  I'm changing my review. After many repeat visits I now really enjoy Sampan. They have a great happy hour  and an even better bartender (Amie!). No I did not know her before I met her at Sampan  this is real  she is awesome!!  I am also a fan of their small plates of food. The edemame dumplings are my favorite!!  I think it's a great place to grab drinks and some snacks with a group of friends!\n",
      "Poor service.  Was blatantly lied too while here.  I wouldn't trust them  food is ehhh for the price. Too loud to enjoy the meal as well.\n",
      "Perfect food  perfect service  perfect ambiance. Anything I left out?  It was my first time there and they certainly left a good impression. Even on a Monday night  the place was packed!  It was cold so I could not sit outside but even inside I felt like I was eating at a beautiful garden. I will make sure to sit outside in the garden as well when it's a little warmer. The pork belly is to die for and the waitress worked with me on my customized \\mocktail\\\" From service to food to ambiance  This is now my favorite restaurant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent meal! We sat outside and the atmosphere was wonderful...great place for a romantic dinner for 2. Arrived around opening (17h) time  seeing we had no reservation  and that was good considering the place was hopping later. Had a the taster's menu  which changes daily...as to b expected for the 8-course menu prepared by the chef himself  each dish was exquisite! Complimentary champagne  coffee and house granola for the road rounded of a lovely experience! Staff in general were brilliant  but our waiter Paul deserves special mention...thanx.\n",
      "Delicious  they do gluten free like Rock stars!  Pricey but worth it.  They are indeed famous for their cheeses\n",
      "Ate at the bar. The bartender was kind  thoughtful  and efficient. Food was incredibly good and we loved the dessert. I don't always review restaurants we love but I just so enjoyed this dinner.\n",
      "I was here for a business dinner  but Talula's would definitely be great for a special occasion. The food was fantastic and the atmosphere is warm and creative. Everyone at my table enjoyed their dishes and the waiter was very knowledgeable and able to offer suggestions for both food and drink. They have a wonderful seating area outside  that if it hadn't been early April  I would have loved to take advantage of.  I definitely recommend stopping by!\n",
      "Excellent food  horrible service. Every time I come here for either brunch or dinner I have high expectations  and every time the service is sub-par. Long waits for food (which is somewhat understandable given how popular the place is) and servers that are either unknowledgeable about the menu or less than pleased to be working there. 3 stars because the food is deliious and the restaurant itself is beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Been here a couple times now and both meals were excellent  and in some way different from other Philly restaurants I've been to.  While most reviews rightfully focus on the food  I think Talula's deserves attention elsewhere.  The space  as many have noted  is very comfortable  even peaceful.  Despite how busy it gets you never feel cramped or like you need to yell in here.  That's big.  The service has always been great - you can tell the staff is well versed in the menu if not a bit jumpy in telling you so.  Heard from an employee they even send staff out to the farms where they procure much of their food to learn where things come from.  That's pretty cool.   This is not to say the food isn't amazing.  Get a cheese plate.  I recommend the Master Collection for its variety  but the others I've seen or tried have been great as well.  Plenty of accompanying fruits and crackers that only enhance the experience  and the staff does a great job explaining each cheese when plating.  I would recommend getting two of the smaller plates rather than one main course since they're about half the price  more than half the size and this allows you to try as many things as possible.  I've had the salmon rillette  a goat ravioli that is no longer on the menu  and the NJ clam pasta.  All were light and refreshing yet filling.  Perfect.  Have heard nothing but good things from groups I've been with about what they tried as well (lamb belly  fluke crudo  hallibut).  Go.\n",
      "Sitting outside in the garden area anytime between May and October.  There's nowhere better. Best cheese plates. Best service  best everything\n",
      "\n",
      "OK  well  let me start out by saying that I don't really eat a lot of seafood  so I got the  Wagy steak with fried egg  shaved truffles  and fries fried in duck fat with a truffle sauce  and it was VERY good. However  not sure if it was $60 good for 6 oz. I'm pretty sure that you can get a much larger portion of great steak elsewhere for less than that (like Barklay prime). That being said  the decor was beautiful  and love the second floor bar and how that just melds into the decor and design of the restaurant.  Also  I went with a bunch of people who DID eat seafood  and said that the sushi was AMAZING and definitely worth it. One person in our party also got the tasting menu with the drink tasting menu with it  and it looked like fun if you're a seafood lover.   The service was great and the ambiance was amazing  and I would say definitely worth it for seafood lovers.\n",
      "Morimoto definitely live up to the hype!    We went here in 2003 and we recently went back.  Omakase is definitely special when chef Morimoto is in the house!  Food is very decadent.  Three words  Oyster Foie Gras Uni.  Opps! I meant four.  You get the idea!\n",
      "Came here for hubby's birthday because he has an Iron Chef crush on Morimoto  even though chances were admittedly slim that there'd be a sighting.  Eating here is not just about the food  it's about the experience. Every dish was delicious and beautiful  and the atmosphere pulls it all together. My one big complaint about the decor is the big glowing phalice in the middle of the table... made arranging dishes on the table precarious and the celebratory birthday photo of us at the table took an unintended turn for the risque  )  The tuna pizza was so good  I'm not usually big on the raw fish and almost stole some of hubby's slices after finishing my own. My curiosity to see tofu made table-side made me order the yosedofu  it was cool  very silky  not the most flavorful but good. He got the chef's selection sushi platter which was so much food. I got the ishi yaki buri bop  came in a beautiful presentation that involved more table-side prep  was ridiculously delicious  and still yummy the next day when I finished off the leftovers.   The black sesame moussecake was again ordered partly out of curiosity  and was very good. They even had a candle on the plate for hubs to blow out =)  All in all an awesome meal. Portions were pretty huge  everything was tasty  and our server was attentive and helpful.\n",
      "Second time to morimoto and even better than the first. Our server  Joe  was super personable and went out of his way to make our night a good one. He explained the menu thoroughly and was so polite and happy to serve us. The carpaccio and the 90 combo was perfect for 3. morimoto doesn't disappoint  ASK FOR JOE!\n",
      "\n",
      "Great food  Omakaze menu is a must  so is the tofu made at the table. The drinks are good if you order from the menu. Ordered an old fashioned which was not on the menu and it was sub-par for $20.\n",
      "Amazing service. Amazing food (even though the Kobe beef was a tad bit too salty for my liking). Even more amazing ambience.  Coming here  I would recommend getting either their sushi platters as an entree or one of their regular entrees such as steak. When I went  I was under the impression that sushi would not be able to fill you up but boy  was I wrong. Definitely one or the other or sharing entrees is the way to fo.  Try the sashimi for sure and no matter how full you are  you should definitely still try the dessert  especially the chocolate pot!\n",
      "I have never had a bad experience here. The waitstaff are well versed on the menu and incredibly professional. They always give recommendations both on their personal favorites but favorites among the customers. In particular  Alice is great - she previously worked at another restaurant my grandparents frequented and has brought over the great and bubbly attitude over to this establishment.  The food is phenomenal - some of our favorites include the baby calamari salad  shishito peppers  hamachi  carpaccio  the toban yaki  sushi  etc. Everything is so tasty and good proportions. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to have a nicer  Japanese meal!\n",
      "Best and one of the most expensive sushi restaurants in Philly. They aren't just limited to sushi and I've had other menu items that were great but the sushi is the gem here. The fish is fresh  very simple rolls  and my favorite thing - there wasabi in the rolls. The drinks are fantastic. I once had this Acai berry cocktail that blew me away. The presentation of the drinks are food are beautiful. The restaurant is hard to find. There isn't a clear cut sign outside that says morimoto  the front is white and plan with a glass door. To the left of the door it says morimoto but it's so hard to read. The first time we walked by it 2-3 times before finally seeing it. The interior is beautiful and HUGE. It's so modern and very nice lighting  a little dark but it goes with the posh theme they're going for.\n",
      "Wasn't bad  but definitely not what I expected based on all the hype.  Honestly  being from South Louisiana  you get used to food with a bit of \\flare\\\" this was sort of boiled in water flavor bland.  Just my two cents.\"\n",
      "I went there to try the man vs food chall. And let me tell u first off there pretty damn good i travel 3 hours to have it and it was worth the whole trek the sandwich is $43 dollars  and well worth it i am proud to say MAN won this one i aced it   its def something u gotta be super hungry for..... After completion of the sandwich u get tge whole place giving you hi-5's and cgeering for you thats another part to being able to finish it all the support  but you get your picture taken for the hall of fam and you get a tony lukes t-shirt but you do not get your money back.... If u want your money back bring a friend and bet him the price of the sandwich u can finiah it..... I seriously can't wait till i go back but i dont need to do the challange again b cuz my pics on the wall already i have nothing else to gain b cuz i shmacked it   Thank you all sincerly shmacktastic\n",
      "We were really hoping this place would be as great as reviews  Food Network  etc. have made it out to be. Their cheese steak meat didn't taste very good when eaten as not part of the sandwich (a piece fell out & I ate it). It was overly greasy. Their roast pork with broccoli rabe & sharp provolone was \\meh\\\". The pork had no real flavor. The best part about it was the roll it was served on & the cheese. Wouldn't bother to eat there again. Disappointed yet again!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Not sure what all the fuss is about...small cheesesteak  served by an unhappy staff.  It's really nothing special  not sure why people wait in line for their food.  The sub roll is just OK and there is far too little steak and cheese on the sub.  I've been to all the so-called great places for cheesesteaks in Philly (Geno's  Pat's  Jims  etc) and they are all average at best.  If you want a great cheesesteak  I recommend driving away from the city and going to Ray's Pizza in Lansdale.  It's out of the way for sure  but sometimes  getting the best is worth some extra effort.  Ray's is head-and-shoulders better than the Philly establishments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cheesesteak had no taste to it   roll sucked they can bake them on site all they want my roll was split in half after two bites !!!!! Service rude slow down register lady u work there u don't own it !! N the girl handing u the food looked like a zombie   take another while ur working     fry were good   and the inside out was good 1.5 starsssssss\n",
      "I'm sorry I went there and wasted my time and money.  Never again.  I went to see what the fuss was all about.  I arrived at 4 PM on a Sunday and there was no line  so I got to order right away.  They told me they were out of fries (what fast food place runs out of fries before dinnertime?!)  that the sausage and peppers sandwich was considered breakfast (since when?! nobody else does!)  and then I had to wait 30 minutes for 2 chicken parm sandwiches.   When I finally got them  they were lukewarm and the chicken was overbreaded and way too thin to sink your teeth into.    The bread they used was too soft to add any texture and its flavor was flat.  Two mediocre sandwiches and a soda for $19...hardly worth the trouble.  Just ridiculous.  Don't waste your time or money here.  I can think of three better places if you want a chicken parmesan sandwich in this town.\n",
      "Tony Luke's makes my favorite cheesesteak so I will never give it less than four stars  but I have to admit I was not overwhelmed by this particular shop.   The small restaurant is tucked under i95 in South Philly outside of the stadiums  and it looks like a hole in the wall. Aesthetics do not impact my review at all in this case because  let's be real  if you're looking for an authentic Philly cheesesteak  you're not looking for some art-laden building designed by Mies van Der Rohe. I came for the food.  The busy store served the line quickly  which impressed me. As per my usual  I ordered a cheesesteak  whiz wit (that's whiz cheese with fried onions). Of course  the cheesesteak was delicious and I ate every bit  but compared to other TLs I have tried  I thought this one was subpar (mind you  par is very high here). The toasted roll was a little too hard  and the meat a little tough. I could have stood for a little more whiz as well.   Still  I love Tony Luke's  and I will be a fan girl of their food for my entire life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stopped by for dessert after a Valentine's Day dinner elsewhere in the city.  It's actually bigger than it looks from the outside and has a decent amount of tables booths to match.  Have heard Sabrina's mentioned on several occasions as a brunch spot  but have yet to try it out.  Did have some of the chocolate cake that was prominently displayed behind the hostess stand.  I enjoyed a nice \\wedge\\\" of cake and it was divine.  The chocolate bits on the mousse-like icing was a splendid way to give the moist cake a bit of crunch to it.  The flour-less chocolate cake was also a nice \\\"wedge\\\" and very dense looking.  My date couldn't finish it and wondered how a flour-less cake could be that dense.  It was enjoyed though  just not to it's demise.  Must try this place in the day time  brunch perhaps.\"\n",
      "Service: Not the nicest staff  Three of us went on a Sunday morning after church. Thus  the wait was anticipated. We only waited for about 10 minutes  which was not bad at all. Important to note that one of us had to step out for something for 10 minutes  but once we were seated  all of us already knew what we wanted to order. However  our waitress continued to avoid eye contact with me for a good 20 minutes. Finally  when I raised my hand to gesture we were ready to order  she rolled her eyes and came over. We ordered for ourselves  and our friend. The food arrived within 10-15 minutes  which was great.  Again  our waitress  who seemed quite flustered with all her tables  continued to avoid looking at our table. We waited for another half an hour for our bill. Our total time spent at Sabrina's was from 11AM - 1:30PM  which I think is a bit ridiculous.  Food: I got a Soy Latte and the Egg White Primavera  and we shared Chocolate Chip Pancakes.  1) Soy Latte - Made with La Colombe coffee  pretty great actually. 2) Egg White Primavera - I had only asked for adding one thing - roasted red peppers. Instead  my omlette had barely cooked raw peppers. In addition  there was no salt and ironically  the only \\veggies\\\" that were added to this omlette were tomatoes of different colors. 3) Chocolate Chip Pancakes - dry  but tasted good.\"\n",
      "Sabrina's (regardless of which location) overall is a solid  safe brunch place to take friends and family from out of town to.   Pros: -- Dishes are very VERY filling -- do not attempt to order multiple items because it is a daunting feat to even finish one plate of food! -- A number of vegetarian and vegan options to choose from and substitute with! -- Tofu Scramble is amazeballs!!! -- The Fairmount location is BYOB (not sure about the other locations)  Cons: -- Do expect a long wait time... I would recommend calling ahead of time to make a reservation -- Weekend brunches  in particular  can get extremely crowded. So be prepared to be in a room full of people and expect a high noise level. -- If you end up on the waiting list at this location  expect to wait outside for there is very little room inside to wait (unless you're fine with blocking the indoor foot traffic).  -- The sweet breakfast dishes are extremely sweet  to the point that it can get sickening... I would recommend the sweet breakfast items to be something shared.\n",
      "I know that Sabrina's is famous for brunch  but I am a big fan of Friday night dinner there. New Sabrina's is cozy and the food is delicious. Also  while some people go there for legitimate dates other semi-fancy occasions   you can show up dressed down (by which I mean clothes that may or may not be pajamas)  and no one looks at you funny. They just point you to a booth and then bring you crusty bread and olive oil. The two best things about dinner- never a wait  and the chocolate layer cake. Seriously  it is the best chocolate cake I've ever had.\n",
      "I love this little diner. Delicious food and coffee  good service  and a nice casual atmosphere. Since I discovered this location  I've been going about once a week. I used to go to the Powelton location on occasion  which is also great  but not as great as this one  I think because the other location is overwhelmed by university students.  Breakfast items and burgers are great choices here  and make sure to check out the always-amusing  frequently-changing specials menus.\n",
      "On this rainy and overall yucky morning  I had a Seinfeld moment and found parking right outside of the restaurant.  How good is that? A good omen for a good breakfast.  I was a little surprised that the place had that old school coffee shop character with all that hipster patronage  but it felt warm and a bit frenetic.  It was 3/4 full at around 9am.    I got the Huevos Rancheros with good guacamole  and an intriguingly smokey and spicy  but nicely light red bean topping which I preferred to the usual heavy and indistinct refried bean glop.  I think there were bits of chorizo in the mix. The blue fried corn tortilla was light and crispy and kept its crunch throughout the meal.  Only thing I didn't like was that the fried eggs came over hard.  Usually like it over easy.  Need to ask next time.  The home fries were terrific  chunks of piping hot  crisp on the outside and almost sweet on the inside taters. This is the best that America has to offer  I swear.  The La Colombe coffee was good and fresh.  Service was friendly yet uninstrusive.  As I left with my left overs  my car was still out front  with 10 minutes to spare on the meter.  Good quick service with exemplary food.  Very un-Seinfeld-like.\n",
      "Tasty and the portions are generous. Not typically a sweets fan  I had the key lime cheesecake and it was yummy.\n",
      "Can't say anything bad about this place other than long wait on weekend but that's not unique to them. Everything here was amazing and great prices  fast service  etc. French toast specials and has Browns were some of my favs but looking forward to trying more.\n",
      "Not a review  but a copy of the letter I wrote to GQ after they did not mention Sabrina's in an article on American Breakfast eateries.  Instead GQ mentioned the \\scrapple\\\" at Little Pete's.  Dear Editor            I am writing to report you for breakfast blasphemy  as you failed to mention Sabrina's Cafe of Philadelphia in \\\"A GQ Guide to the Most Important Meal of the Day.\\\"  You have not breathed air until you have eaten at Sabrina's.  There are even two locations for your complete indulgence.         Instead of mentioning the place where Buddhists achieve breakfast nirvana while brunching on \\\"Bad Girls Quick Draw 'Yee Haw' Tex Mex Breakfast\\\" or \\\"Stuffed French Toast\\\" with \\\"cream cheese and mascarpone  filled with raspberry  champagne poached pears  red grapes and roasted walnuts\\\"  you mention Little Pete's \\\"scrapple\\\".  Next time just club a baby seal and serve rare on a Thomas English Muffin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Always wanted to try this place  so I went for lunch today.  Good sandwich.  Too bad the size of the steak was very  very  very small.  I felt like I was eating a mini cheesesteak.  Now I am still hungry and have to go find something else to eat.  Not worth $9.  Not even close.  You might be able to  get away with charging tourists that  but not me.  NEVER AGAIN.  Rip-off.\n",
      "BEWARE of the young tall skinny Hispanic girl with glasses and a bun that works there. Went on a Saturday evening and she tried to sabotage my order to no avail while I had my 1 year old in tow.  As my husband was on line waiting to order I asked her if there was a changing station. She told me no and was not nice about it so I walked off seemingly annoyed. Guess she didn't like the attitude back.   As we were on line she was playing some staring contest with me from afar and when it came time for us to order  she coincidentally jumps back on the register. She was speaking Spanish to her colleagues and made very obvious eye contact to them referring to us with a smirk on her face. She definitely wanted me to know she was up to something. Very angry individual. Pathetic I might add.   After we order and wait for our food  she specifically asks me which order number I had. No one else. Just mine. She was definitely out to get me. Get our food and realize it's not what we ordered. We ordered a regular cheesesteak and she gave us chicken and paid for the chicken one. Sorry but the joke's on you. You just wasted one of your sandwiches and we ended up paying less for a Philly cheesesteak. Thank you for that.   In reading other reviews like mine  this may be the same person that other Yelpers were referring to. Someone like this is bad for business (and Philly) and I can't be a patron at a place that I can't trust to not tamper with my food depending on your mood or attitude and therefore will not be returning.   What a shame because with all the competition out there  you'd think you want customers back but it's not worth the trip back due to your unprofessional  immature workers that have a lot of growing up to do.\n",

      "After a night of partying in Old City  there's no better place to go for some 2AM bites than Sonny's. They use the classic Amoroso rolls for their cheesesteaks  so you always get a good sandwich. The bacon cheese fries are another great late-night staple. They definitely don't skimp on the whiz. Seating is ample  too  so it's great if you have a big group of friends.\n",
      "Didn't fill my expectations  I like to try local food everywhere I go  but this time I regretted. The taste is flat and overprice. I will never try it again\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When in Philly a steak is required. Got the cheese steak with provolone cheese and no onions. I probably should have gotten it with onions through. It was slightly dry  but overall pretty good!\n",
      "\n",
      "Terakawa Ramen is probably one of the best ramen places I've ever been to. I tried the Tan Tan Ramen with chicken and it was delicious! The noodles were cooked to perfection and the broth was just spicy enough. I also tried some of the Signature Ramen  which was good  but I definitely preferred the Tan Tan. I also ordered a croquet as an appetizer  which was good and cheap  but I probably wouldn't get it again because it was just deep fried potato with a dipping sauce on the side. Regardless  the ramen was amazing and the service was super quick! Within a few minutes of sitting down  the waitress had taken our order and not even five minutes later  our food was served. Word of caution - this place is pretty small and gets very busy. I got there around 5:30 on a Friday night and one of the last seats at the bar. As we were leaving  there were multiple parties waiting in the doorway  but the ramen is well worth the wait!\n",
      "I tend to whine about how some things in New York are just so much better than in PHL  eg. the theatres  the gym classes  the sheer variety of asian desserts  and THE RAMEN. Terakawa is no Totto  but it's solid comfort food for a good price. When I crave ramen in Philly  I'll head there  and I intend to try all the other items on the menu!   I went for the first time  and ~7pm on a weekday there was barely any wait for 2 seats at the bar. The appetizers are pretty reasonably priced ($5 for 2 pork buns). I ordered the mayu ramen ($10)  though the name sounded a little dubious and I was afraid it'd be a less authentic variation of ramen. But nope. It was gooood. It reminds me of black garlic ramen. The broth was thick  creamy and rich without causing that bloated aftertaste. The noodles were perfectly cooked  Hakata-style I believe  thin straight noodles. The pork was a little different from the usual chewy  thin slices of char siu - this was thicker  fattier  and tasted much softer. I liked it  though! It melted in my mouth. I was a little disappointed to only be given half an egg (especially after my failed experiments to recreate ramen eggs at home).   The other great thing is the fried garlic provided at every table. I probably ate way too much garlic that night. No regrets at all.\n",
      "I've been here a few times. First time was when they first opened and the rest were recently. I had always order their miso ramen and noticed that they had definitely improved over time. Loved the pork buns and the seasoned onigiri was also very tasteful. Overall  satisfied with their friendly food.\n",
      "I love this place.  Signature ramen is my favorite.  Also takoyaki are delicious  I have been getting take out since there is often a long wait\n",
      "I have been to Terakawa around 5-6 times now. The service and food has been consistent and exceedingly exceptional. The miso ramen is an excellent vegetarian option and the broth is so delicious it is my go-to here even though I am not vegetarian. The chicken and pork bun appetizers are really great as well. My boyfriend had the gyudon  curry and beef udon and thought they were all really good. I also think it is affordable and you usually need to wait  but the wait is always quick and the wait staff really moves quickly too. Hostesses and servers are super friendly. It is a smaller place so it can be tight during peak times but is still nice. I would not go here with a group larger than 4 because of the small size  but it is ideal for a single diner or two people. The staff works really well together as well  and it shows.\n",
      "PROS: Great atmosphere  nice decor  good service  large portion.  CONS: Anything sushi-related is the wrong choice. We ordered an onigiri(triangle rice ball) as appetizer  oh boy was that bland without any filling. Noodles were just fine  but kinda pricey. The $14 jumbo-sized yet under-seasoned ramen wasn't worth the money cos it didn't taste better but larger-portioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terakawa is utterly incredible.  I'm not familiar w other Ramen establishments  but we were so utterly impressed with this place.  The interior is very stylized  clean and warm in a welcoming manner.  The wait staff are friendly and helpful.  The menu is mysterious and fascinating.    We were very impressed with the presentation of the noodles and more impressed with the flavors and textures.  The prices were right and we walked away feeling great.   The experience itself was unique  fulfilling and enlightening.  We want more!   I walked in a Ramen boy ....  Now I'm a Ramen man!\n",
      "A friend mentioned this as one of the best ramen places in Philadelphia so I had to give it a try.  Came in and ordered a large spicy miso ramen ($9) after about a 30 minute wait on a Saturday night at 5pm.  The ramen took a considerable amount of time to make  about 15 minutes  but I'll forgive them since their waitress was super nice and because they were obviously swamped with orders.  But anyways  about the ramen.    For me  ramen can be broken down into 4 components: broth  meat  noodles  toppings.  The broth was a really rich flavor... almost too rich if that's possible.  It tasted like it had been simmered for half a day if not longer  but maybe it was because of that that it felt like there was a certain freshness missing from it.  Perhaps it would have benefitted from a drizzle of sesame oil or truffle oil on top  to give the broth an extra aromatic oomph and flavor.  As is  it just tasted a bit too overpoweringly of pork and miso.  The meat was absolutely fantastic.  The meat was barely holding together with my chopsticks and even less so when I bit into it.  Had a good amount of fat that further added to its texture.  Flavor was also a bit strong  but overall not too bad since the meat is meant to be paired with the more \\bland\\\" items like rice or in this case noodle.  Speaking of noodles  these noodles were all right  nothing really to rave about but definitely adequate for a ramen place.  The toppings similarly were all right and nothing to rave about.  Had some bamboo shoots  bean sprouts  half an egg  and some of that asian black fungus in strips.  A boring composition  which kind of felt like it was thrown together to provide asthetic appeal to the dish.  The egg was well made however  and the bamboo shoots weren't too bad either.    Overall  pretty decent place I will almost definitely venture to again when I have a craving for ramen  but not a place I'd glowingly recommend as the single ramen culinary experience that my friend had made it seem to be.\"\n",
      "I just had my first meal at terakawa ramen and it was very good. The cuisine was created with care and the taste was full of flavor.  You can even select the amount of salt and softness of the noodles.   The price was impressive for the quality of food we ate.    Pork buns. Must have Broths are a bring home  Karage chicken curry was moist and crispy.  Tea - tasted like hot water.  Don't get the tea.   The wait staff was attentive and nice. The restaurant is relatively small but cozy. Lines could easily form if there was a small crowd in the mood for some good food.    Good quality for the money. Will be back again.\n",
      "I love the atmosphere of this place. It's more of a lounge than a restaurant. Excellent decor. Great customer service. Conveniently located downtown. The place tends to get crowded so don't go starving. But in case you do  just go upstairs to the bar... same menu and better personable service.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend and I were just wandering downtown when I was struck by the giant olive out front.  Naturally  we had to enter  and once again were pleasantly surprised when we saw the swing-seats upstairs.  Early as it was (5ish?) we immediately got a table with swings on the second floor  and proceeded to order.  The service was fantastic  the classic cocktails are done just right (I'm an aviation lover)  and the food  though a bit small for the price  was incredible.  Loved the pad thai and the ahi tuna.  Came back a couple days later for drinks on the rooftop and while the lobster mac and cheese wasn't quite as good  the cocktail was once again perfect.\n",
      "I stopped by the Midtown on Sunday afternoon mostly to escape the rain partially out of curiosity.  My friend and I were actually headed to Devils Alley for brunch when the sky opened up and unleashed  there fury.  The Midtown was closer so we hoped in there to warm up and get something to eat.  The Decor is great very quirky and trendy but fun at the same time.  I feel bad for the waitresses though the uniforms are horrible almost like car hops without the skates.  I ordered a burger which was fantastic and my friend got the lobster mac and cheese which was very good.  I also tried the bacon infused bloody Mary which sounds scary but was amazing.  It didn't seem like that had a very extensive menu for that hour of the day but I liked what I ordered so oh well.  Our service was good nothing over the top amazing but decent.  all in all it was a OK experience.\n",
      "Had a cute little brunch and some cocktails with my girlfriends here this past weekend. Their champagne drinks and food are delicious  and their service was speedy and friendly. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because they are a bit overpriced and also we asked to sit in one of the booths in the middle of the first floor and were just told \\no  sorry.\\\"\"\n",
      "Went here on a Sunday  great ambiance  awesome customer service  food was also delicious! Great area\n",
      "Starr restaurants are the place I kinda hate to enjoy. He is never very chef-centric (albeit il Pittore) and I prefer to support establishments that are. But I love the continental  both locations. They have a big menu  but not in an overwhelming sense. Just big enough that you can go with a big group and everyone can get whatever they are craving. All different types of cuisines and for the portion size I think the prices are very fair. Some of our favorites are the tartare  french onion soup dumplings  lobster mac  mushroom flatbread  and rad na thai chicken. OH and they have an awesome salad now. Called the continental chopped I believe.. kinda like their own version of a nicoise. It is amazing. Drinks are meh  nothing too special. And of course  being a Starr establishment  the decor takes you to another place.\n",
      "There's two locations  olde city and center city. The one in center city is bigger and has a rooftop bar. The decor inside both is retro and very cool. The center city location has these wicker chairs hanging from the ceiling  it's cool looking but not very comfortable. Brunch - food is ok. Not mind blowing but decent. The drinks are where it's at. I came here with my bestie and she had this bacon Bloody Mary which I got to try and it was awesome  made with bacon vodka. YUM!   Rooftop bar - The center city location has a rooftop bar with a separate entrance past the main entrance. The ambience is really nice and modern. There's a interior and exterior portion up there. Interior part is air conditioned which is a must on the hot and humid summer nights of philly. The drinks are pricey for philly standards  about $10 each but the cocktails are good. It's usually really packed on a nice night out so get there early.\n",
      "this place is definitely a creative stephen starr restaurants. I loved the whole layout  the different seating arrangements  the furniture  the lighting fixtures  etc  etc  but we're here about the food!   My sister  cousin and I ordered the lobster mac n cheese  french onion dumplings  and the calamari salad. Again  from an eater from NYC  the portions were amazing! Fed all three of us and kept us full for hours (3 to be exact). I wasn't crazy about the lobster mac n cheese bc they used orza instead of macaroni or any other pasta. It was creative but just felt wierd eatting mac and cheese like that. The calamari salad was excellent. just simply  good amount of calamari and great vinegar dressing. The french onion dumplings were good too (6 of them per order) but again  being from a family of restuarant and buffet owners  they could have used a different type of skin for the dumplings.   Service was excellent  atmosphere was great  and the food decently priced (again  I'm from NYC) so I was happy! will come back if I visit Philly again.\n",
      "Two stars  only because the food was still somewhat enjoyable but no longer memorable (this used to be my favorite restaurant when I lived in Philly... alas...it is not the same any more - what happened to the desserts?)   Only the Brussels sprouts saved the night.    What pulled the rating really down was the drinks We ordered sangria in a pitcher at $40 and it was filled with so much ice that there was very little red wine.  In the end the sangria was sooo diluted after the ice had melted... If I can make better sangria at home  what's the incentive to go back to Continental?  There are fine dining restaurants everywhere nowadays and good bars too...\n",
      "Now this is what I call a very good cheesesteak. You can see them making your sandwich with chopped beef and some provolone. As expected  the chopped beef rather than slice gives it an extra flavor that just taste outstanding with the provolone. Definitely a must try at this place.   Another outstanding sandwich is the Roast Pork. One of my biggest regrets in life is ordering the small instead of the large roast pork. It was my first time trying a Roast Pork and just really fell in love with all the flavors. The Roast Pork was very tender and moist full of spices and the spinach went perfect with the sandwich. Like I said should have ordered the large.   This is definitely a must stop every time I'm in town. I really don't see a reason to go anywhere else.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want a great cheesesteak  Johns is the place to go. If you want great customer service  please avoid at all cost. The staff is rude and unorganized. They talk down to their customers and mock new patrons for not successfully navigating their confusing line system. We get it  you're from South Philly. Quit trying to give off a perception of being a hard nose tough guy and make my sandwich.\n",
      "Yep  this is the best roast pork sammich there is. Get into the car and go there for lunch today.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd read so many reviews saying this was many yelpers' #1 favorite cheesesteak joint in philly  so I had high hopes walking in. This was the first stop of many on the \\cheesesteak tour\\\" I took my brother on when he was visiting from out of town. We got the original cheesesteak with onions and it was a solid sandwich  mostly because the steak was decent quality and not super greasy  but nothing to write home about. Also inaccessible without a car so I think I'll stick to Jim's for my cheesesteak cravings!\"\n",
      "So damn delicious. We came to Philly for a couple of days and this was our first stop. We were indecisive  so we split a roast pork and a cheesesteak. The roast pork is really delicious  though I think it is definitely meant to be eaten IMMEDIATELY or it gets too soggy. The cheesesteak was our favorite  though. So much so that we actually came back here two days later for breakfast on our way out of town. My first cheesesteak had American cheese  and my second had sharp provolone  and I was surprised that I actually preferred the American version (though both were wonderful). I think this will become one of those places we have to hit if we're ever within like 45 minutes of here.\n",
      "This is the best place to go for a great philly steak and roast pork sandwich. It's a little off the beaten path and it's as touristy as the other steak shops. It's a mom and pop shop. Literally  the owners and workers are related. While we were there  what looked to be the mother was there sitting outside with patrons  and what looked to be the children were inside taking orders and making sandwiches. I got the chicken philly and it was fabulous and my boyfriend got the roast pork. The sandwiches are massive and we literally had enough leftover to eat for dinner. It seemed that most people got their sandwiches to go  but there is some seating outside where you can eat there. Definitely go!\n",
      "Absolutely the best Philly steaks and roast pork.  The attitude is brusque  the wait is a bit annoying  but the sandwiches are completely worth it.  GREAT FOOD!\n",
      "I moved out of Pennsport earlier this year  and one of the biggest regrets I have about leaving the neighborhood is being seperated from this eatery.  Johns Roast Pork is  hands down  the best cheesesteak I have ever eaten.  From the moment you walk into Johns  you know you're in for a treat.  The atmosphere is quaint and unpretentious like other more well-known Philly steak joints.  Now and again you might find a tourist who was tipped off and somehow found their way down to this section of town.  However  by and large  the customers in line are comprised of city workers  dock workers  white collar suits  and people from the neighborhood.  And that's what you get treated like here -- like you're from the neighborhood.  The family and crew that run this multi-generational shop treat you as if you were a member of the family.  I have never had a bad experience at Johns  and I have been here probably 20-30 times since last summer.  All items are made per order.  There's no 10 lbs. of precooked meat on the grill here.  That being stated  be prepared to wait if there is a line ahead of you.  It's worth it though.  My favorite is a mushroom steak with grilled onions and sharp.  Grab a drink and some Tastykake Krimpets for deserts  and you're all set!  Not in the mood for a steak or just don't want to wait?  No problem.  Skip the line and go for the namesake  the roast pork sandwich.  Heaven!  It's marinated in a special recipe  and you get lots of it.  Like the cheesesteak  the large roast pork is served on a long roll with sesame seeds.  Too good for words.  Or go for breakfast and get a scrapple and egg sandwich.  The only downside is the hours of operation.  It makes it a bit cumbersome sometimes.  But if I have the afternoon free and 45 minutes to spare on SEPTA  you know where I'll be.  Johns Roast Pork!\n",

      "I had come here for lunch with a girlfriend  and the duck I had ordered was one of the best ducks i had ever eaten. After raving about this place all week my fiancee and I decided to try it for dinner. It was even better at dinner I was very impressed and it was one of our best date nights. I can't believe this place is a \\chain\\\" its bar none above the rest. GO its a must try  have the duck or the wasabi filet and make sure to start with the tuna pizza  its amazing.\"\n",
      "My boyfriend and i went in early for our reservation. The friendly hostesses sat us right away.  Service was up there  fine dining at its best. The managers were on the floor assisting  I wish i could've gotten his name. Tall dark and slim man. Very polite and checked on us twice  he even assisted with clearing our table. Very impressed. The waitress and service help were always on the move  and very attentive to all of the tables in the section. We ordered the spicy rock shrimp with bao buns and it was my God delicious  highly recommend. Came out perfect temp. The black pepper beef tasted good  seasoned well  but came out room temperature. The beef fried rice lacked seasoning so we used the sauce from the other dish to improve the taste. It also came out room temperature. The restaurant was full house  and not sure the kitchen was able to handle the volume. We were too tired to address it at the time and so we ate the semi warm dinner. Felt bad as the whole staff was on the move to serve. Perhaps try to dine their off peak hours to get the best quality. We went in at 6pm.\n",
      "When I can afford to go to Buddakan  I will go. It's one of Steven Starr's more upscale restaurants  and it's bastardized  fancy Asian dishes.  Don't miss the martini that's full of cilantro. It's called the Bonsai. Bizarre yet amazing.  Hands down  the best appetizer here is the edamame ravioli. My first thought about it  the first time I had it  was that it tasted like Christmas cookies. Then a friend of mine said that something so delicious could only be full of the Dalai Lama's jizz. Decide for yourself.\n",
      "Where do I start? Nothing but good things to say about this place.  I'm not really a huge fan of eating at expensive places bc they tend to attract the snotty type in both the patrons as well as the staff.  I also usually end up spending a fortune and leave still hungry.  This place was the exact opposite.  The staff was super friendly and down to earth.  The food which is obviously what I pay most attention to was incredible.  The edimame ravioli is an absolute must. The beef kimchee fried rice was amazing.  The duck was super tender and the pairing of it with the cornbread was unexpected but \\to die for.\\\"  And the miso cod was extremely flavorful and definitely my favorite.  In a world of rare 5 star ratings (for me)  Buddakan definitely earned all 5 of theirs.\"\n",
      "I am giving my experience at Buddakan a 3 because  sadly  the server ruined the experience. I came in for lunch last Friday and ordered from the Restaurant Week menu. I have eaten at Buddakan plenty of times  I am a huge Starr fan and I love the dishes here. The food on Friday did not disappoint. I had the edamame ravioli (to die for!)  the vegetable fried rice and the Thai chicken salad. My dessert was a heavenly chocolate lava cake with mango... no words to describe it. It was incredible.  Our server Shawn on the other hand  was not so incredible. He was short  not very friendly  and would walk away in the middle of us asking for something. At the end  we had to split the check and he walked away from me as I was explaining what I needed him to put on my card. Sure enough  when he came back  the wrong amount got put on it.  There is no excuse for being ignorant to customers when you are in the customer service industry. Such a shame that an establishment as renown as Buddakan would keep rude servers on staff.\n",
      "It was everything I hoped it would be- I've been to the other two locations and actually think this one is the best! It's the original buddakan and maybe as a function of it not being too crowded  I really enjoyed myself here. It was spacious (the AC one is very cramped) and not too noisy  and the setup was simply beautiful.  We had: pan-seared sea bass- my favorite seafood dish ever black pepper beef - just okay dim sum sampler - good edamame ravioli - awesome monkfish - I felt it was just good  but my bf LOVED it dungeness crab sticky rice - awesome eggplant - yummy  typical chinese eggplant dish  green peach tea soda - super yummy mango lassi - not as much so  kind of artificial tasting  The service was great- I've noticed that the servers at all 3 locations try to act airy and cool  but it's kind of funny because it makes them sound like children playing at being businessmen or something. I enjoy the show though :)\n",
      "Buddakan never disappoints! Beautiful venue  delicious food and friendly waitstaff. Tuna Tartare Spring Rolls are the best appetizer!\n",
      "Had an early birthday dinner here last night - unbelievable! We ordered everything we desired and everything was great  although one dish really stood out - edamame ravioli! It sounds weird but it was delicious! The cocktails were also good  and when we requested a coffee drink at the end of the meal  they whipped up something for us that was not on the menu. It was the perfect pairing to the decadent bento box of desserts. Staff was super nice to us. Decor of the place is a little 90s  but well maintained.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a scale of one to things that are awesome  this place is the bomb.   I was drawn in by the promise of the duckfat frenchfries. Took the boy for his birthday and put our name in  had a drink around the corner while we waited and were given seats at the bar after about 45 minutes.   We were waited on by Keith  the bartender  who was congenial  knowledgeable about his whiskeys and an all-around cool guy. We started with 3 cape may salts (two for me  one for the boy) and tater tots  both of which made me happy.  For dinner  I got Kentucky Fried Quail (stellar  though the succotash was not as exciting as I wanted it to be) and the boy got the 24$ Fois Gras burger  which was incredible. Worth every penny. The duckfat fries were pretty yummy  but not even the best part of the meal. I could've done without the cheese sauce  but as it was on the side I wasn't deterred.  I look forward to coming back here  with everyone I know.\n",
      "Picked up takeout from Village Whiskey (so I can't review the actual restaurant). The Whiskey Burger is pricy ($26) but is amazing if you're ok with a greasier burger. Super tender  the bacon is awesome and it's pretty big. If you can get past the price then highly recommend it. The Duck Fat fries are also rich and delicious.\n",
      "There is a great selection of whiskey bourbon to suit anyone's taste. We had burgers with the fried egg on it and it was soo good and probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. The duck fries are a MUST if you come here. It is a cute atmosphere although we went with a party of 4 and it was a tad awkward the way our seating was and made it difficult to have conversation with everyone at our table. Overall  a nice place to go. We will be going back.\n",
      "fuck yes. meat  bourbon libations  and a salad (to round things out aka make myself feel better about ingesting the aforementioned two items.) i took myself on an early birthday date with myself and was not disappointed (neither in the food nor the company). i had a medium rare plain burger to see if it was worth all the fuss...no cheese  bacon  dressing  etc to disguise the quality of the meat. (of course  no bread either since i'm gluten free.) the burger was great - perfectly cooked and seasoned... though  i felt like a bit of a freak sitting at the bar eating my burger with a knife and a fork. i'd like to come back to try a fancypants burger since the extras look pretty tasty.  the salad was so-so  it was no frills with the perfect amount of dressing. the bartender-cum-waiter was super attentive but not cloyingly so. he made delicious sazeracs to accompany my repast.\n",
      "If you want The Best burger in Philly  this is the right place to come. The bread was fresh  meat was nothing but juicy  service was a amiable  price was descent and affordable to everybody!\n",
      "Dearest Reader   Please allow me to hereby confirm the rumors: Village Whiskey does  in fact  have the best burger in Philadelphia. And  I should note  some of the best bartenders.   As my wife and I sat at the bar waiting for our friends to arrive  I marveled at the infinite selection of whiskeys and bourbons. I decided that this  self  is the day you will begin liking whiskey. So I petitioned the bartender to \\make me something awesome with whiskey in it.\\\" \\\"What kind of drink do you want? \\\" he inquired. \\\"I have no idea  good sir. You see  I am a neophyte  a tyro  and fledgling when it comes to spirits such as these.\\\" (Perhaps my banter wasn't quite at this level at the time  I was already a few drinks in from my visit to Franklin Mortgage  but this is how I remember it going.) So  he thought about it for a while and proceeded to mix up the craziest drink I had ever seen -- it had whiskey  orange bitters  an egg white  Portuguese red wine  and other stuff in it! The verdict: delicious. I also had the \\\"The Commodore\\\" off the drink menu  and it was very good  too. The drinks are a little pricey here  and they will set you back around $11 or $12 each.  When our friends arrived  we were seated outside and I got to try to village burger and the short-rib and cheddar duck-fat fries. The burger  which comes with an artfully restrained dollop of homemade thousand island dressing  was unbelievable. The applewood bacon and the dressing served the elevate the already-incredible taste of the meat. I can't wait to come back and order another one. As for the fries  they were very good  but I think next time I will stick with the plain duck fat fries. Our friends ordered those  and they were super crispy and delicious.  Warning: this place gets insanely busy  so you might have to wait a pretty long time for a table.   All in all  the drinks were great  the food was delectable  and the staff was very knowledgeable and personable. I would totally come back.  Still dreaming of that burger  Chris M.\"\n",
      "Cool spot in a great location. We got there early  so didn't have the same crushing crowds others have talked about. The bartenders are awesome. Made me a Perfect Rye Manhattan on the rocks  never had one before...I'm hooked. Easily the best burger I've ever had! Will absolutely be back\n",
      "My brother and I ate here to celebrate my college graduation and I must say I was very satisfied. Great vibes in the restaurant  our waiter was outstanding  and the food was delish.\n",
      "Ok yeah  the service can be a little high falutin'  and the wait is painful but this is THE BEST BURGER EVER.  That's all you need to know.  The BEST.\n",
      "SImply not impressed.    I got a burger with blue cheese and carmelized onions.   The meat was high quality  but the bread to meat to cheese ratio is all wrong.  The burger was very thick and as such left most of the bun meatless.  They could have made the burger thinner  gave it greater circumference  and not left me with a half grilled cheese/half burger scenario.   Not a big fan  won't go back/order delivery.  Its simply not a good burger and at $60 for 2 people  I'd rather try the devil I don't know.\n",
      "This place is SOOOOO delicious. The decor is awesome reminded me of a cafe in Paris I went to. The service was great  everyone is quick and nice and helpful. The owner asked us a few times if we were good and was so nice! The food is incredible I cannot wait to go back! By far  my favorite brunch spot in Philly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't stop thinking about the brunch I had here the other day! The food was out of this world and I would drive the two hours back to Philly just to have a bite again!  My boyfriend and I came by for brunch on a Wednesday morning and we were seated inside immediately. There's also some seating outside if it's a nice day. I can imagine on the weekends that this place would be packed  but unfortunately they do not take reservations  so try to get here early or be prepared for a wait. The restaurant is tucked away in a quiet neighborhood and there is some free street parking for two hours.  The menu had so many unique offerings that made it hard for a brunch fiend like me to choose. It's a cool mix of French and Lebonese items. The food on the menu was about $18 plus  but trust me it's worth every penny. I decided to go with the sweet potato Benny and it was EVERYTHING! The Lebonese sausage and the sweet potatoes gave a cool twist to a brunch classic. It also came with a fruit salad that was fresh and tasty. I also ordered a vanilla chai latte and it was the best I've ever had! Not overly sweet and it was served with pretty latte art. My boyfriend ordered the Parisian Zá  which came with a ton of food so if you're hungry order this. Service was outstanding as we were never without want. I can't wait to come back here again the next time I'm in Philly!\n",
      "Great great breakfast and coffee place! Was here for brunch with the family  everyone loved their food. I had shakshuka  keep in mind that they call it something else  and it was tasty and fresh. The pastries and coffee are amazing as well. Can't wait to go back.\n",
      "Great food  my favorite brunch place in the neighborhood.  Also one of the few that actually takes credit.\n",
      "The owner is very friendly and down to earth  and the place has a nice atmosphere. The restaurant decor is very cute and it's a good size.  There is also available seating outside.  The food tasted very fresh and looked vibrant and was well prepared.  It was tasty and didn't take long to come out.  The service was great and the wait wasn't too long  although it gets very busy.   However  I felt in comparison to other brunch places and their prices  you get more food for what you pay for than here at Cafe La Maude  where the proportion of food isn't as large.  I still felt content afterwards  and the food is delicious either way.  It was a refreshing and enjoyable meal!\n",
      "One word: Excellent. Excellent atmosphere. excellent service. Excellent menu options. Excellent fresh taste.   We looooved this place and had a hard time selecting what to order because we wanted to try everything. Everything was exceptional and met our high expectations after reading all of the rave reviews. We will be back very soon and often!\n",
      "You will die with regrets if you're in the city and choose not to stop by here. I don't care how far you have to go  because if I got here on foot under what felt like 110F  then I have faith in you too my friend.  SERVICE * Super attentive  friendly  sociable and quick! [1]  ENVIRONMENT * Lovely outdoor seating * Classy interior seating near the front * Refreshing and brighter lit seating in the back * Clean  Parisian style unisex restroom  FOOD (menu) * Something for everyone [2] * Worth every buck [3]  FOOD (experience) * Saumon Fume a cheval [4] [5]  OVERALL Cafe La Maude is a one of a kind breakfast joint! Tucked away a little distance from all your typical Philly tourist attraction sites. But like I said earlier  it's worth the travel. Because if I could  I would maximize every criteria for a review.   Breakfast is the most important meal of the day  so make it worth it with a trip and splendid dining experience here!!   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  [1] The owner does a much better job than any teacher/professor I've had at remembering your name and face  regardless of how many people there are waiting for a seat. Even if the line goes on to the other side of the street  he will do whatever it takes to hunt you down and get you that seat. They do a fabulous job of getting customers seated  served  and out for the next customer  and craving for more in a heartbeat  without the slightest bit of pressure to rush.  [2] The menu felt like love at first sight! Would definitely come by again and again to try everything. Every order was the definition of a perfect breakfast  included carbs  proteins  veggies  fruits  etc.  which so many breakfast places tend to forget and just load you up with potatoes. Huge fan of the exotic menu that differentiates it from other typical breakfast joints.  [3] Prices run on average of $15-16. Worth every bit  for the amount of food you're getting  for the quality  and for the photogenic food presentation.  [4] Avocado spread  mascarpone cream cheese & creme fraiche  smoked salmon  tomatoes  cucumbers  radish  arugula  chives  onion  and capers  served on pumpernickel bread  with a side of potatoes & a sunny side up egg  [5] This does not receive nearly as much hype as it should  and that's coming from someone who's a picky salmon eater. Nothing all too overpowering. Perfect balance of everything on your nice and chewy bread..mmm...yum~ And you also get your fair share of egg porn.\n",
      "this place has reduced their portion sizes while at the same time increasing prices  very disappointing as this used to be a good place\n",
      "I come to Han Dynasty nearly every time that I visit Philly. The food is amazing (favorites are Dan Dan noodles  cucumbers in chili oil and dry pots)  the service is quick  the prices are reasonable  the building has awesome architecture with modern upgrades  and the location is convenient.\n",
      "Tried the new location and the food was as good as ever  had the cumin beef with the dan-dan's to start.   Full bar now and good beer prices ( necessary to quench the mega-spicey palate!)\n",
      "Came here for my birthday with a group of 6  we contacted the restaurant about three days in advance for a reservation and would up with a 9pm reservation on a Friday night. Corkage fee is $10 for wine and $1 for each beer you bring. We brought some IPA's and lager which was great with the food. You can buy alcohol in the Old City location for cheap.  Atmosphere is a bit chaotic on a weekend  and it can get a but loud in there. Food was awesome we were able to try a bunch of things  most dishes are able to be shared family style. My favorite things we  shared were Dan Dan Noodles  Chili Dumplings  Cumin Style Chicken. I was not intimidated by the spice level of the foods because the heat was complex not just burning.  Prices were reasonable  and it was absolutely delicious.\n",
      "First visit to Han Dynasty. Interesting place with large ceiling and good decor and huge bar w TV's. The food was excellent for Chinese. Our group likes spicy food and we got 8/10 on their scale which a little weak on spiciness. We felt at that level they had overdone the pepper flakes to compensate for the spiciness and they also provided spicy oil. We got the dan Dan noodles  chicken dry pot  mapo tofu  and wonton soup w chicken. The Dan Dan Noodles were a good start. The dry pot chicken had too many pepper flakes but was otherwise well done. The mapo tofu was also excellent  the saucy was not too runny and it was not overpowered by flakes as well. The soup was standard and also a good choice. Service was excellent but their table layout was weird. We sat in the middle of the entire place.  We will definitely go again  very reasonable prices  and overall a good experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just great. Atmosphere   food  service. Right in the heart of olde city. Snow pea greens and sesame noodles.\n",
      "\n",
      "I usually prefer Thai over Chinese any day  but Han Dynasty is hands down the best Chinese I've ever had. Overall the restaurant is very clean  and has vaulting ceilings giving the appearance an A+ so it would be appropriate for client meetings  dates  or just a casual get together. The pricing was very moderate  we were able to get 3 apps  a round of mimosas  and 2 entrees for under $80 including tip. Our waiter greeted us with a pot of tea which was awesome. He also provided me with drink and food recommendations to make sure I got the most from my visit. I do wish I got a non-noodle entree  as we had the Dan Dan and sesame noodles as apps but it was amazing. I did request for my rice noodles as a 7 spicy and they came out more sweet than spicy but everything was so delicious that I don't even care.\n",
      "This is everything you'd hope it'd be from the reviews.  Awesome Chinese food.  Do they need another good review?  Probably not  but I just have to throw out some of my favorites.  Loved the dan dan noodles (still spicy after we turned the heat down 2 notches!)  the scallion chicken was a big favorite at our table  Kung Pao chicken packed some great heat with the chilis and crunch with the peanuts  and the garlic sauce beef was my personal favorite.    Prices are awesome.  We shared 6 items: soup  noodles  fried rice  and 3 entrees  ordered two beers and it only came out to $84.  Service was solid and happy to fill you in on how they do things at Han Dynasty.  Menu is really user-friendly and breaks it all down for you.  And the food comes crazy fast.  It was easily less than 15 minutes from the time we ordered that we got everything brought to our table.    Cin Cin in Chestnut Hill had been my favorite Chinese in Philly  but this has just taken the lead.  Can't wait to get back in here.\n",
      "Ate: OMG  so many fresh donuts.  And chicken.  The chilly garlic. So messy I think I used like 3 wet wipes and still smelled it on my hands hours later.  Drank: N/A  Liked: FRESH doughnuts! Where can you even get this anymore?  Disliked: Seating was weird if you wanted to share  but it's a minor gripe.  Chicken: Ohhhhh baby.  If you get the wet glazed flavors  be prepared with lots of napkins or wet wipes.  So spicy.  Would mom like it?: Uhh.. does a bear crap in the woods?  Would I go back: Yes!  Recommend: I didn't try any of the fancy doughnuts since I can't resist fresh ones  but they looked amazing.\n",
      "So worth it. Hot  fresh donuts every time. The perfect thing to grab on the way to a holiday party\n",
      "I have lived a block from this place for almost two years and finally got around to trying it today to see what all the hype is about. Let me tell you  the donut lived up to my expectations. I got there around 3:45 and there were only three fancy donuts left in addition to their three regular donuts but no blueberry mascarpone  which is what I wanted to try the most. I went with the cinnamon brown sugar  fresh from the fryer  which is their standard donut.   One word: delicious. This is how a donut should be  not the imitations you can get at Dunkin Donuts (even though I love their breakfast sandwiches). There was a good amount of cinnamon brown sugar covering the donut  and it was fried to perfection. I'm going to work my way through the menu  next up for my second visit will be the blueberry mascarpone  which may be tomorrow morning given how tasty this flavor was.   Definitely get there as early as you can because the donuts go quick. I didn't try the fried chicken as I'm not a fan of it  so I'm not sure how it is but from what I hear it is equally as good.\n",
      "Do I always eat like this? No but when I want fried chicken and a donut this is where I go! The buttermilk friend chicken is amazing. It reminds me of cool ranch doritos! They also give you a honey donut to go with it... YUM! To be honest  I always go donut before chicken. Tourists  this is a go-to! :)\n",
      "Oh man... I could go for a Federal Donut right now.  This place is great... if you get there early enough to get the good donuts.  I particularly enjoy trying the different types of fancy donuts.  Don't be fooled though  these are not light and airy Dunkin Donuts or Krispy Kreme esque donuts  these are very dense and much more flavorful.   I still haven't tried the fried chicken  but it certainly looks and smells delicious.    The shop itself is hidden on Sansom Street so the crowd is a bit more local than tourist during the week  but it certainly gets busy on the weekends.\n",
      "Alas  the chicken was dry.  And I was disappointed since I've been wanting to try it for awhile-- thinking that there must be some magic to this place that sells only fried chicken & donuts... AND is affiliated with Michael Solomonov my hero from Zahav.  The coating was crisp and tasty and hot from the fryer.  But fried chicken's no good if it's not juicy.  I ordered the small sampler box with 4 pieces and a honey glazed donut.  The donut was ... a donut.  No magic here:(\n",
      "Ok  LONG overdue review: My fiance's parents had invited us and a few friends over for dinner  and as dessert they picked up an assortment of the Federal Donuts' various donuts for all of us to sample together. They must have gone early because they were able to get the strawberry-fennel  mocha  double chocolate  maple bacon  spicy peanut butter jelly...I feel like there were other flavors  but I honestly can't remember because there were so many piled on that platter - waaaaay too much for us to even finish!  We kept cutting small chunks off of each donut as we chatted. My fiance had tried their donuts before and had told me that they were rich and cakey - too much so to be able to finish a whole donut. I didn't believe him until I tried them myself  and he's right (for once  ha!). I would feel sick not long after eating one. As for the flavors  they're pretty good...when I could taste them. The cakiness masks many of the flavors  especially the sugary ones like the strawberry (seriously  there was NO fennel flavor)  but glazed flavors like the PBJ were more pronounced  although I did not find that one spicy  and I could barely get a taste of bacon on the other one  which is a travesty since bacon flavor overpowers almost everything!  Next up  I've gotta try the fried chicken - in all it's incarnations - but why is it so impossible to buy before it sells out?! I want fried chicken for dinner dammit. Not everyone can join the lunch rush *sigh*\n",
      "Yummy! Brought home some delicious chicken tonight - Federal BBQ and Chili Garlic.  Also grabbed 1/2 a dozen fancies. So delicious! And convenient right on my way home from work.    Love this place.  From all the awesome food  to the nice staff  to the cool setup and vibe in there.  Not to mention the sweet and efficient checkout process.  Love signing my receipt on screen with my finger. (dork  )   I'd try anything from this place. And with rotating flavors  I won't have long to wait for the next new thing!\n",
      "I was in Philadelphia for a day trip  and this was on my list of places to visit as I was looking up places to go eat. We stopped by a few minutes after it had opened  and the owner was extremely nice. I ordered their coffee  the milk n' cookies donut and the strawberry lavender donut. The milk n' cookies donut was okay  but the strawberry lavender  oh my God! It was like heaven! It was freshly made  hot off the line. I bought myself a box to take home because they were THAT good. The atmosphere  ambiance  staff definitely made this place feel welcoming. The price for the donuts are definitely reasonable and affordable  coming from a NY'er. I would definitely visit again  when I'm in Philly!\n",
      "Shabazzi dry rub chicken is the bomb. Donuts  not sure if they live up to the hype. Chocolate and p&b donut was okay. Their donuts are really dense and a bit dry. Service is okay. Small place. Interesting one sweater tables. Better eat in than take out.\n",
      "no  but seriously. i think i could live off their crispy cauliflower / spice with a kick. it's that f'ing amazing.  happy hour goes til 7pm now (M-F): discounted apps  beer  wine and cocktails. option to sit at the bar or in their swanky cocktail lounge tucked away in the corner.   and don't leave without trying at least one of their desserts. they are PERFECT in every sense of the word. basically  i'm obsessed.  vegans  vegetarians and meat-eaters alike  you gotta check this place out.\n",
      "We've been meaning to try Vedge since the moment Horizons closed it's doors.  We finally got the chance when my sister visited.  It's still a bit tough to get a table at good times during the weekend  so we ended up with one of the first reservations of the evening.  The restaurant space is really open and airy.  I really like that they did not cram in more tables than needed.  The food is the real star here though.  I did think it's a bit odd there's a bunch of small dishes but you don't really order it tapas style.  No worries though  you just need to pick a few and you'll be in for a treat.  One of my favorites was a carrot dish and of course all the desserts were great.  Service overall was pretty good.  Everything was bought out and cleared at just the right time.  Our server was nice and did a good job  but nearing the end of our meal I really felt like we were getting rushed out.  I totally understand tables need to be turned and we were the first seating  but I definitely noticed it.  Overall though  I wouldn't hesitate to go to Vedge again and try all the dishes we couldn't try the first time.\n",
      "The most amazing vegan food ever!!!!!!! Everything is so carefully prepared and beautiful presentation!\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent restaurant  vegan or otherwise. The mushroom dishes are fantastic. Definitely worth trying.\n",
      "Food and service excellent. Go here and forget about the vegan thing and just enjoy delectable food presented well with amazing flavors. Only disappointment was the peashoot broth  which just tased like a overloaded miso soup. Great place.\n",
      "Behold the power of vegetables!! We love Vedge. I cannot stress enough how much we love Vedge. Being vegetarian or vegan and a foodie can be a lesson in frustration. Too many restaurants believe \\holding the cheese\\\" on a sandwich  or offering a salad and fries is a \\\"vegetarian option\\\". Yes  there are more vegetarian restaurants these days  thank god  but not the number of gourmet ones that are necessary. Vedge delivers in the gourmet category. These dishes are not only immensely flavorful but creative.  The atmosphere is downright charming and the service couldn't be better. My only complaints are  although tapas  the portions could be a tad larger for the price. My husband and I usually order 3 each plus a dessert each (sticky pudding is diviiiiiine!) and we eat something at home 3 hours later because we just aren't satiated.  Which brings me to my second complaint...no more bread. They used to offer fresh baked bread which was not only delicious but filling. We still order the same amount but now we go home hungry.\"\n",
      "If you are interested in trying some wonderful vegetarian food  in a warm and relaxing place  with great wines  then try Vedge. Unbelievable menu  which changes with the seasons. Creative  beautiful presentation and delicious- even for non vegans! The sticky toffee pudding is a must for dessert. You would never know you're eating vegan!\n",
      "When people say this is the best restaurant in Philly and not just the best vegan restaurant  they're on to something. It's certainly one of the best restaurants in general that we have here in the city. Incredibly satisfying on many levels. Everything is top notch  just delicious. Get the shiitake mushroom entree with celery root fritters and the cheesecake and or the chocolate uber chunk dessert. Great bar selection as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The meats where bbq to perfection. Excellent cuts of beef. All the vegetable and salads Excellent. The cold asparagus  shitake mushroom  Manchego cheese  papaya  pineapple all great. The Service was exceptional. I just wished their was a lower priced wine bottle on the wine list.  That is what I hate about a $$$ on food. The wine is usually $$$$$$\n",
      "this was my first time to fogo.............the steaks were awesome....but i found the salad bar and the service to be better at chima. At chima we didnt have to ask our server for clean plates or drink refills.  i could  live with those 2 issues and i would go back.\n",
      "Very good food  excellent service and very friendly staff. If you like your meat well done you may have to wait a little longer to get served as they only bring out med well to med rare meats. Love this place!\n",
      "Don't go here if you're a vegetarian  even though the salad bar is good. Come here for your Atkins diet.  Each cut of steak is delicious and seasoned well.  It's not cheap  but oh so good! I was really impressed with the service.  You really have to be on top of your game to flip over the card to red otherwise the server will be there with more bacon-wrapped filet mignon.  How can you say \\no\\\" to that? DAMN!  I'm ready for my nap now after that food coma.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If there ever was a meat heaven  I landed there last night at Fogo.  I came here for the meat so I barely got anything at the salad bar.  I must say though that their smoked salmon is fantastic.  After the salad bar  I pretty much spent the rest of the time eating meat  meat  and more meat.  Here is the array of things offered: lamb chop  sirloins  filet mignon  chicken  sausage  pork ribs  beef ribs  etc.  Personal favorite for me was lamb chop and the filet mignon.  The best part is somehow they are able to carve out from rare to well done for each when available.  You will be so stuffed guaranteed.\n",
      "Maybe my favorite place to eat.  You get the fantastic Fogo experience: mounds of juicy meats of all varieties  quick service  a robust salad bar  and solidly stocked bar.  This location  though  is in an exquisite old bank building.  So  you get a wide open dining area with high and intricate ceilings (very nice...).    Only (minor) complaint: Things can get bogged down if you come with a large party  especially if you are seated in certain areas of the dining floor.  I have had several great dining experiences here  though  and look forward to heading back whenever I am in the area.  Do yourself a favor  and grab some piled meat at Fogo (keep that card on green).\n",
      "Excellent - we had a prior issue before but the manager  Ryan  jumped in and promptly took care of it. We came back for a second time. He treated us as his guests. The food was excellent  the service was even better. Will be returning!\n",
      "The food is so great! The price is so reasonable for a high-class buffet like Fogo De Chao in Center City Philadelphia. The salad bar is wonderful. I heard that you can even go for the salad buffet itself with a cheaper rate. But my family is a meet lover  we don't mind paying money for good brazilian bbq. Remember to turn the card to red if you want to enjoy the meet in your plate or don't want be disturbed. The free refilled-Brazilian drink (I forgot the name  but they will recommend it to you when you sit down  it's their house special) is so great! They will always refill for you even you don't ask.\n",
      "I thought I died and went to heaven. Latino men walking around offeing me the best cuts of meat  while drinking good wine. A pure hedonistic pleasue. Ahhh.  Great food  great service  and atmosphere. You bring your company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Awesome happy hour both after work and late night! $1 oysters even with this oil spill going on. The service is quick and attentive. Oysters are delicious and fresh with a great variety to chose from. East & west oysters galore. I personally am an east coaster all around  salty and delicious. My friend loves west coast oysters for their buttery-ness so this is a great place to go if your company is the total opposite of you!  I'm a huge clam chowder person and there new england style  although not as thick and creamy as I usually like  tasted wonderful. If your an oyster fan this is the spot to go to in philly!!\n",
      "I dragged a some friends out for $1 oysters and $3 beers  so this review is just about happy hour  and the conclusion is this: definitely go.    At this point  I've told you al the things you should need to know about Oyster House  but since I'm feeling generous I can point out that one less enlightened member of the party had the burger  which they reported to be good and not overcooked.\n",
      "Great meal all around. Arrives at 5pm for happy hour on a Friday. Had some oysters  beer  and shrimp shooters. All in special 5-7pm.  Main course lobster roll was delicious.  It's not large but plenty of lobster and  will fill you up for sure.  Compliments to the Manager Daniel for being very attentive to the entire restaurant.\n",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE this place I love all seafood  I love sitting around the shuckers  they engage in conversation and we made friends with peeps on either side of us.  Happy Hour they have Buck-a-shuck ! Yum Everything that I've ever ordered is delicious and the service is outstanding.  Parking garage right across the street and close to Prince theatre which is where we were heading.\n",
      "Because I knew that they (unfortunately) don't take reservations I stopped by 30 minutes in advance of our meeting time to advise that three of us would be there for  lunch. Their representative duly noted my request. When the three of us arrived at the appointed hour the same representative advised that they were clearing tables (at 12:30?) and that they seat people by the available tables dependent on the size of the party.  Fifteen minutes later we were still not seated. I approached the owner who explained their seating system to me.  Ten minutes later he returned and led us to our table. Whatever their seating system is  it doesn't work! Beyond the frustration of getting seated the three of us had a delightful experience. Our server was efficient and professional and all business  though not as friendly as we would have preferred. Our beverages and food items arrived in a timely manner by someone other than our waiter yet placed by the appropriate person (how do they do that?).  Our meals were delicious  with the freshest ingredients  nicely prepared and presented. This is an authentic oyster house so consider the high noise level as part of the ambience!  For an establishment of this caliber they should seriously a reservation system. Yet  no doubt we shall return.\n",
      "Great ambiance  the restaurant is really beautiful. The happy hour buck a shuck is where its at. We had some really tasty oysters  great drinks  fun atmosphere. Looking forward to returning!\n",
      "The atmosphere is perfect with romantic  relaxing lighting. Everything is so squeaky clean which makes me feel especially comfortable and safe. Friendly  educated  fun and quick to make an excellent recommendation for your likes should be expected from the entire staff from the hostess  to the bartenders  and the servers that fill the restaurant. You can tell that the management is top notch because all of the employees love their positions and are so happy to be there and to be serving whoever comes through the door. It is honestly the warmest and most sincere welcome! The food is the best part of the entire experience  fresh  creative  and amazing tasty!! My favorite crab cake ever  my husband dreams of the oysters and the super creative homemade sides to pair make this place an absolute gem!! We could not be happier with EVERYTHING!!! Thanks for setting the bar so high OH!\n",
      "We went to Oyster House with a seafood craving. I started with the Sauteed Mussels and was impressed by the generous portion. For my entree  I ordered the Lobster Roll  which was slightly smaller than I expected  but very tasty. We went to Route 6 a few days later and agreed they were similar in quality and ambiance  but we had a slight preference for Route 6.\n",
      "Second trip to Oyster House  as I know that their seafood is FRESH.  Well  we ordered the lobster and shellfish pot with potatoes and corn.  The 2-lb. lobster was just ok.  The clams and mussels were pretty yummy.  The corn was tough  like pig corn  and the potatoes were tasteless.  Therefore  I must downgrade my review from my first visit.  Shame.\n",
      "So this is what you need to know. Everything taste great  well at least what I had. I practically tried everything for breakfast and have come to the conclusion that this is the spot for breakfast. I have one gripe though  the monte cisto is not worth the price and is way over priced. I know truffle oil is used but that should not be the reason its so damn expensive. one egg  one piece of toast and some sauce. Don't ever order it  not worth it unless they drop the price $5. everything else is worth it taste great. Jebbs open face and the huevos rancheros are my favs. Enjoy. oh and the coffee is addicting. Also there are no reservations  so get there early or go about 30 min before u think u may be hungry.\n",
      "Love the food. Big portions  interesting and ever changing menue. The only issues i have are that the seating is cramped  too loud for conversation and the coffe is not as good as Sabrina's.  The latkas are always perfect and the bacon is the best I ahve had in Philly.\n",
      "I heard alot about Honey's and how the food is so good here. I chose today my birthday to be my first visit .I read earlier reviews about how crowded it gets and they were not lying but I didn't wait no more than 20 minutes. Now let's get down to the food it was delicious. I had french toast  home fries  sausage and for dessert a slice of Jewish apple cake and it was to die for! I will be back most definitely.\n",
      "Everything great about a jewish deli  southern comfort joint and a bit of mexican dive restaurant all mixed together. Brisket is good  but don't expect a tomato based sauce. Latke is not a normal round one  but super delicious. I also took the Jewish Apple Cake to go and despite being a little too brown on the bottom  it was delicious even 3 hours later on my flight back to LA.\n",
      "Arrive between 7am-9am on a weekday and get their breakfast bargain! Two eggs  home fries or LATKE  toast or biscuit  and bottomless coffee all for FOUR DOLLARS!  The service was amazing and I got a delicious breakfast and experience for less than it costs to take the bus to and from work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yo- just order the Grits no matter what time of day you think it is.   Historically  most of the time I was too hung over to recall how we got there  but thankful that I had arrived. Guaranteed that by the time I left I was a new person.  On a side note  Honey's always seemed to be part of the worlds longest walk of shame.  The only way to improve the place would be to offer a locker room with showering facilities.  One time  near Halloween  I want to see Pinback play at the TLA. I had dressed in a full Hooters uniform and received many accolades from my date  other concert attendees and the general public. The next morning we woke up and drove a scooter to Honeys. I sat there  a bit worse for wear  eating the Grits in that uniform and really could have used a shower.\n",
      "Awesome local brunch if you can wait the 30 - 90 minute wait. I like to walk around the neighborhood while I wait  great garage sales nearby usually.   French toast is yummy and so are the potato pancakes.\n",
      "I would normally give Honeys 5 stars.  On saturday I went with a group of 7 people. Since Honeys is one of our favorite places to get brunch  we knew that we would have to wait up to an hour for a table. Since they have such good food  it's worth it.  But this is why I'm no longer going to go there  and the reason for the two star rating:  The hostess was horrible. There is only ONE table that can seat up to 8 people. We went in  she told us that the previous party has been sitting there for a while and would be done at any minuet. She also told us that we would be the next people to sit down. We thought  great! since they were putting on their coats and getting ready to leave.  After the staff was finished cleaning up the dishes from the table  the host sat down A PARTY OF THREE PEOPLE. that also  CAME AFTER US!!! I just don't get it. There were plenty of other tables available  so why sit a party of 3 at the only table that can comfortably sit 8?   I understand going to Honey's with a party of 7 isnt the smartest idea  but when the hostess tells us that we would be next in line for that large table and then sits 3 people  that is the dumbest thing ever.  Needless to say I am never going there again. They blew it  they lost our business.    we left and ate at the foodery on 837 N 2nd St.\n",
      "I LOVE this place!  The service is good  the food is very fresh  mostly organic and/or locally grown and reasonably priced.  I've had the grits  bacon  eggs  biscuits  fruit salad with whipped cream  cornbread........and it is all delicious.  This is one of the best brunch places in the city.  In addition to great food the service is also very good.  They are attentive without being intrusive.  The only con is that the location is small  which makes for long waits on the weekend for brunch.  Here's a tip - If you arrive after 1:30/2pm on Sunday....you will be seated right away.  Enjoy!\n",

      "Was referred to Beiler's by my Lyft driver when asking who has the best donuts in town. I was thoroughly impressed. Went to the Terminal Market for shopping and lunch and then stopped by for dessert. Got a half-dozen to take home. I loved the peanut butter jelly donut  the apple fritter and the maple bacon. All were fresh and delicious. I'll more than likely get some every weekend I'm at the market. Thanks for the delicious yummy donuts!! See ya soon!\n",
      "Amazing is the only way I know how to describe these little bits of heaven...oh wait  I just described them another way. There is nothing like a fresh  peanut butter cream filled  chocolate covered donut  and they take the cake. stand right there and watch them make them  it doesn't get any fresher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazing  just superb. Waiting in line here is like the last week before Christmas  feels like it goes on forever when all you want is that sweet payoff! Unlike that reindeer and snowman sweater your grandmom gave you for Christmas  this is the winner every time. The blueberry  ahhhhh!! The apple choices  amaaazing  the key lime was spectacular  the Oreo-- wife's fav is something to dream about. And just like Christmas it's all gone before you know it and the waiting begins  only I don't have to wait till December!!\n",
      "So I was in Reading Terminal Market....wandering around aimlessly when I saw an Amish bakery.  I ordered the shoofly and pumpkin pie and then headed off to NY to visit my pops  bro and my Hannibal.  Shoofly pie was ok for shoofly pie I guess.  Not overly sweet like everyone said it would be.  I'm not a fan of sweet sweet.  I guess if shoofly pie was good it would be sold everywhere but it isn't. Now pumpkin pie I am an expert in so I buy in everywhere.  I wasn't impressed.  My homemade pumpkin is better and I'm not a fan of my own.   I haven't had a really good pumpking pie in a long time however.  : (\n",
      "Stopped by Reading Market and tried Beiler's donut.  Wow best donutes I've ever had.  Made my taste buds to back flips  jumping jacks and cartwheels.  I'm not a big donut guy but these ones were great.  Had the Oreo creams filled the creme filled and the powder donut.  The texture of the donuts is perfectly made and is a dynamite of goodness exploding in your mouth\n",
      "Was so surprised with the long queue  but it was worth the wait. Amazing varieties...delicious yummy donuts!\n",
      "The donuts are thee best. However  I didn't care to much for the apple cider donut. It taste bland a and not a hint of cider. My children loved the M&m and S'mores. The fruity pebbles was a eye catching  when people noticed it in my box. My favorite is the glazed.\n",
      "Have friends or family visiting from out of town? TAKE THEM TO MAX BRENNER! Want to take that special someone out for a romantic evening? TAKE THEM TO MAX BRENNER! And not just for dessert! Cocktails...Dinner... it's ALL delicious! The atmosphere is fun for all ages.  We've taken both of our families here and both were wowed and impressed. I've been here for a business lunch and of course it's the perfect date spot. We've visited over a dozen times and every time is just as great as the last.   The Southwestern Caesar Salad with Chicken is one of my favorites and he always gets the Burger--the waffle fries are dusted with cocoa powder and make them that much tastier.  Dessert is obviously the best course--the Peanut Butter Chocolate Euphoria is PERFECT for sharing (and I highly recommend it!).  Drink a bottle of wine or sip a hot chocolate in a Hug Mug....either way GO TO MAX BRENNER!\n",
      "I came in here with a few girlfriends for dessert. Service was good and attentive. The food was just so so. I ordered the Mexican hot chocolate. It needed to be richer  sweeter and spicier. I also ordered the fondue. The food was the easy to dip as brownie and cookie kept breaking up. I just ended up eating those without dipping. The vessels they give you to dip the food it are not easy to use because there's not much chocolate in each. The chocolate also could have been richer and sweeter.   I left still feeling like I wanted dessert I didn't get here.\n",
      "Had a reservation for lunch during $20 pre-fix meal restaurant week. Wings came out undercooked. Our waitress gave us another order and our food came at the same time. They were decent. The burger was good  but no better than one from TGIF or Applebee's. Dessert was a crepe with peanut butter  banana and chocolate....very good. Overall  I enjoyed the experience but I don't know that I'd go back.\n",
      "I would recommend corn croquettes side  which is the best item I had at Max Brenner. My group also got the chili and cocoa powder waffle fries  which were good  but the cocoa was not a noticeable flavor-- definitely seen  but not tasted. The onion rings with the chocolate ranch dressing was the adventurous dish of the night. The rings were good  but like the fries  the chocolate looked like it was added  but was not tasted.   The hot chocolate is okay  nothing very special  but drinking it out of the hug mug was an experience I would recommend for people who haven't been here. They had a good apple tart a while ago and their chocolate fondu is a fun dessert.   I would go here for the experience  but do not plan on going again unless I have a guest in the city.\n",
      "Yuck.... just yuck  Let's start with the avocado skin in my salad.... jump to the dirty floor where something spilled and wasn't cleaned up properly..... Dessert?!? Oh wait that was another ordeal PRETTY sure they never put it in to start. Needless to say we won't be returning\n",
      "Amazing place for chocolate desserts!   First time: I got Max's famous chocolate mess party for two  which was good but has wayyyy too much whipped cream. The layer of cake on the bottom was pretty thin (no more than 0.5 inch thick)  and the amount of whipped cream on top was HUGE. More cake (and a bit more vanilla ice cream to balance it out) and less whipped cream would make the dessert perfect. The choco-pops topping was delicious (adds crunchiness and even more chocolate flavor to the smooth ice cream and cake texture). Nothing impressive  like 3 stars...  BUT 2nd time: I got Euphoria Peanut Butter Chocolate Fudge Sundae (Max I-Scream)  which was amazing! The peanut butter fudge was so thick and so good. It was better than the first dessert and definitely a lot more unique -- worth like 4.5 stars.   Will have to try some chocolate drinks next time! Heard milkshakes here are amazing.\n",
      "First stop for Center City Restaurant Week:  Max Brenner for lunch. Three courses for $20. Multiple choices for each course  but I picked the chips with spinach artichoke fondue to start  the Brenner Burger (bbq sauce  lettuce  tomato  cheddar  onion ring) with cocoa chili waffle fries  and the peanut butter and banana chocolate crepe with chocolate ganache for dessert. Massive amount of food  but my stomach is superhuman when it has to be and I ate every last bite (to the shock of my dining companions). Because of this  I had no more room for actual chocolate or hot chocolate in a hug mug \\by the bald man \\\" but walked it off for sure right afterward. I was really surprised at the size of the portions  especially for prixe fixe menu at lunchtime! I mean  especially tne dessert  man! A full-on crepe filled with rich peanut butter  banana slices  and even more peanut butter sauce  and chocolate ganache to pour over the top - almost put ME over the top  if you know what I mean. The full dessert order according to the regular menu includes dulce de leche ice cream too...! Whew. Twenty bucks was a good deal  a ton of food  service was okay.\"\n",
      "Me and my wife go here when ever we get a \\Date Night\\\" this place is awsome! The lunch and dinner food is good  but obviously the real star is the deserts. Between the 2 of us we've tried almost everything and never really had a bad desert. If you go in the winter make sure you get the hot chocolate in a \\\"hug mug\\\"! Weird mug but really good hot chocolate. One word of advice try to pee b4 going into this restaurant because they only have 2 single person bathrooms and sometimes their is a line. You can trust this review because I'm a chubby guy and you know us plumper people really know our food!\"\n",
      "Way overpriced for what you get.  We got the chocolate fondue for two.  It came with a tiny portion of barely warm chocolate  bruised bananas  a curiously hard \\waffle\\\" and a few other things.  On a positive note  the Mexican hot chocolate was tasty.  Peanut Butter Hot Chocolate was del\"\n",
      "We went here for dessert only  but what won me over was the yummy aroma of chocolate when you first walk in. The Churros Fondue was good but a little too sweet. Their hot chocolate was good too but you figure at a place like this  it should be. What I really liked though was their Chocolate Chunks Pizza \\The Works\\\" (chocolate  hazelnut bits  bananas  peanut butter sauce and roasted marshmallows). This is a good place to grab dessert with your girlfriends. I imagine this would be a good place to get your chocolate fix when you're pms'ing too.  )\"\n",

      "I had a weekend in Philly and went here for dinner- everything was excellent  from the drinks to the food  to the service.  I am only going to mention the ceviche- watermelon and tuna.  You must try this dish- one of the best and most unique singular dishes I have tasted in many moons.  Literally every bite  my mouth was thanking me and I was smiling from the wonderful taste sensations.  If you go here  do yourself a flavor favor and order the tuna-watermelon ceviche!!\n",
      "I don't go to Philly often  but the few times i've been I managed to go to Alma de Cuba twice on different occasions. Being a Cuban man myself  I have to say Alma de Cuba puts a fabulous twist on Cuban food and decor.  The restaurant is beautifully built and decorated with elegant Cuban-inspired furniture and art. It resembles an old Spanish-style home with rod-iron screens and handrails. The lighting is strategic and subtle to create an intimate setting  which it successfully achieves despite being a 3-story high restaurant.   Their lunch crowd is nearly non-existent  which makes it a bit boring. For dinner on the other hand  it is extremely busy  but yet its craziness is softened by the restaurant's atmosphere/decor.  The food was amazing both times I was there. It is pricey but definitely worth trying. In regards to others' comments about over seasoning  I can agree a little bit  because we had a problem with the guacamole  which was way too seasoned to the point that it was inedible. Everything else was made to perfection.   Although it's cute and feels intimate  it may be a little overwhelming for a first day. Definitely more of a 2nd to 3rd date restaurant  so folks from the City of Brotherly Love  get your eat on!\n",
      "Lovely lovely ambiance - we stopped by for dessert and coffee on a Friday night after dinner at Tria. We got a table  great service and FABULOUS desserts - their famed chocolate cigar and a flan.\n",
      "Drinks: hibiscus margarita - awesome  passionfruit caiprioska - pretty good  not too sweet. Cornmeal rolls and oil dip  solely good. Appetizers ( this was fun): let's talk ceviche. We ordered three to contrast and compare: the shrimp  scallops and the rainbow. The rainbow was recently reworked  with shoestring potatoes now over the ceviche instead of thinly sliced as served previously. The rework was definitely worth it  as our combined scores put this ceviche as the frontrunner. As fas as the other two  the scallops were a clear winner over the shrimp  having too much of a sweet  clumsy and saucy overtone  where the scallops were fresher  lighter and just tastier. Another appetizer that knocked our socks off: chorizo sliders. As strait forward as their name  these little wonders charmed our taste buds off. I seriously contemplated the possibility of trying to recreate these on my own for a future summer barbecue. Just be sure to include the cucumbers and jalepeño garnish to achieve the full orgasm of flavor that we enjoyed. Since we were on an appetizer kick  we simply had to have the oysters - the Oysters Rodriguez. While I am not certain what \\fufu\\\" is  it really doesn't matter. These little fuckers were simply awesome. On to the main courses. We had the sugar cane tuna  a nice balance between the spinach and the tomato coulis. The beef tenderloin was almost perfect - the crabmeat could have been a little warmer  but the combination was a little mundane. The vaca frita - the skirt steak - was probably the favorite. Aside from appearing on the plate like a mexican flag - the combination of seasonings was a delight to enjoy - cinnamon  cloves  lord knows what else - it was a sensory delight. We're on to the desserts now  with the chocolate cigar - a tough decision over the chocolate tower - and a special dessert with some combination of avocado  white chocolate risotto and candied pineapple -  but I'm fairly cation it will be wonderful.\"\n",
      "If you're looking for a mojito that packs a serious punch  look no further than Alma De Cuba.  Lush red lighting makes the bar a perfect spot to suck down the tasty - but pricey - cocktails.\n",
      "It strikes again!  And if you're not careful  it can happen to you.  Good ethnic food meets \\fusion \\\" i.e. the white wash.  Honestly  it's one of my worst nightmares.    I really went in with great expectations.  The website  the drinks  the menu.  Yes  it was good  I can't deny that  but it was also very pedestrian.  Salad was fine  empanadas were good  chicken had flavor  salmon wasn't dry  and the desserts were cute (think chocolate cigar).   But like the analogous Asian fusion restaurants  there's a semblance  a shell of the culture in the food  but none of that kick.  There's nothing raw and beautiful about the food.    But as I didn't do the ordering  it might have come down to preference.  I would have gone for the whole fish dish  if I had a choice.  All in all  it was good food  but it's not a restaurant that I will circle back to again until I've made a few more rounds around Philly.\"\n",
      "Came here for restaurant week.   Started with happy hour which is 5pm-7pm. Had the smoked albacore tacos. They're tapas-style. Very tiny delectable bites. $5 mango mojito was bomb.  This place is huge. We were seated on the second floor. Very romantic atmosphere. Candlelit  ceiling fans spinning  super dim.   I went with the Ecuadorian ceviche  chicken imperial  and pineapple up-side down cake. I was not a fan of corn nuts in ceviche. Everything else was delicious. Chicken was tender  and the rice was cheesy and tasty. The pineapple up-side down cake is literally a lump of sugar. I'm pretty sure it could give you diabetes.   Service was amazing. Staff is so knowledgeable about the menu items  and take good care of you. They even clean off your table in-between courses.\n",
      "The place is amazing  my boyfriend and I went to celebrate anniversary Valentine's and it was truly a very pleasant experience. Since we both have latino backgrounds it made us feel like home. The food is 100% 10 10  good quality  good service. The staff was super friendly. The price is definitely high  it's not somewhere I would go once a month but it's a special ocassion restaurant and I love it. It was a little bit dark  we had to use our phones to read the menu but I feel like it adds to the ambiance of the place.\n",
      "I came here for Happy Hour and the appetizers and drink were amazing! I ordered the mojito classico  smoked marlin tacos and guacamole. The mojito was well made and properly strong although not overly so. The tacos were SO GOOD! Good flavor with a little kick in a crispy (not greasy at all) warm shell. I would venture to say that this guacamole was the BEST I've ever tasted. When I tell you that I could taste EVERY ingredient it's not an exaggeration and the diced pineapples on top added another dimension to the flavor. The guacamole was accompanied with crispy (again not greasy at all) plantain chips that were yummy. The food in this place was great! The staff was nice  polite and very attentive. If I had to make a complaint about this place  I'd say the lighting or the lack thereof. My food was more visible in the pics I took (with the flash) than in the actual restaurant. I hate to say this but I actually had to use the light from my cell phone to see my food  otherwise I would've given this place 5 stars. Though the very low lighting makes for a romantic ambiance  I think that they should consider turning the lights up JUST a hair since many people like to actually SEE what they're eating. With that said  I will DEFINITELY be back for dinner!\n",
      "Descent cheese steak  was able to use delivery although delivery was pretty high at $5 through yelp.  After delivery  tip  tax a $12.71 cheesesteak (the block) was $22.65 the thing that really ticked me off was that I was charged an extra $1.50 for extra cheese that I didn't authorize.  I recommend the block  but the sharp provolone was too much...go american cheese or get whiz instead.\n",
      "This was amazing!!! The sandwich did not at all disappoint. A family of 4 can rack up a pretty hefty bill  so there are a few things you can do to save.   1) A sandwich is BIG. If my husband and I could have agreed on one sandwich  we could have split it and been satisfied. I didn't really feel hungry the rest of the day because I ate the entire sandwich.  2) We ordered chicken fingers  for the kids (ages 8&5). They could have split an order.  3) Skip the great beer selection. I know  that one's hard!   Most seating is upstairs  but we got to watch the Phillies game while we ate  because they have two large flatscreens.\n",

      "Based on Yelp reviews I decided to try this place while in Philly for work.  I don't eat beef so I got a grilled chicken cheesesteak with provolone  fried onions  cherry pepper relish and mayo.  It was huge.  Only one size and price is ok  I did build your own and even had to pay for the mayo.  I got fries too  they're waffle fries and they give you a generous portion.  The to go bag was stapled and while they included ketchup packets (I didn't ask for them) there was no salt and the fries really needed salt.  I got a side of siracha aoli so dipped my fries in that  thank goodness because I wouldn't have eaten them plain with no salt.  They have the coke machine with all the choices which is nice.  They have a huge beer selection and boozy shakes too - I didn't try them.  I'd go again.  Enjoy!!\n",

      "This restaurant is like whoa! I don't usually write reviews but my experience at Bud & Marilyn's leaves me no choice. One word (or  a trendily truncated word): delish. After living in NYC the past few years  this restaurant just  may have me reconsidering my ole stompin' grounds.   Quick rundown of tonight's dishes:   Cheese Curd (5) - A must. Pillowy  cheesy heaven.  Lobster Bun (4) - Really great but the lobster meat was somewhat lacking. I wish I could have tried the Nashville bun as well.  Heirloom Carrots (5) - A whole lotta good right here. Melded  fresh flavors. Bugs Bunny would be proud.  Local Grits (5) - Grits  cheese  veggies. Pretty sure this should be a food group.  Short Rib Stroganoff (5) - I don't eat meat often (I just got over a bad case of vegetarianism for the past 14 years)  but I stole some bites of this dish. Perfection! Be forewarned  vegetarians.   Funfetti Cake (5) - I was bursting at the seams but made room for this monster-sized cake. Worth it. Moist  buttercream perfection with sprinkles.   Overall: Go here and ask for Ben (waiter) - it will be hard to leave disappointed. Unless  of course  you hate great food and sprinkles (but then I don't trust you - sorry!).\n",
      "I don't have a long  in-depth review  but so far that seems to be the theme for reviewers of this place. If you liked Juniper Commons before it closed  the food reminds me of that. Loved the decor  but the drinks (NY and Marilyn Old Fashioned) and food  fried chicken  ribeye and short rib stroganoff (though small portion on the latter) were great!   I've worked a restaurant when it first opened before and it takes time to get your groove  but the service was good.   Funfetti cake is awesome.   (Be sure to tell them you want your meal in courses or else it will come out share style- as it is ready)\n",
      "Service sucked! Benjamin  though appealing to the eye  if you're into the lumbersexual sort of thing  is a sub-par server. Pushy  ignorant  and cocky are only a few of his charming personality traits.  Our entrees showed up only 1.5 hours into our visit  and needless to say  the food was DA BOMB DOT COM! Cheese curds app  skirt steak  and grits a la veggies  and 5 drinks later  and we are only too happy to leave.   Chef gets 1 000 stars. Benjamin though....\n",
      "\n",
      "Went back and got the special for the night  happened to be vegetarian. It was super oily $20 squash ravioli  I didn't enjoy. But the service was great and the biscuits are still amazing. If I ever have meat again I'll come back for the fried chicken :P\n",

      "I recently went here for CC Restaurant Week lunch.  I made a reservation for 12pm (when the restaurant opens) and upon arriving right at noon there were people waiting to be let in-we were seated right away  and by 12:30pm the restaurant was packed. Their restaurant week lunch menu offered a large selection of options with dishes that were marked indicating they could be made vegan upon request.  I went with a party of 3  we all enjoyed all of our courses (I got the Nashville hot buns-ton of flavor with definitely a kick to them  the turkey sandwich-standard but yummy  and the apple pie-amazing)  and left super full. I definitely want to return for dinner to try their fried chicken!\n",
      "Four of us went to Bud and Marilyn's last night for dinner.   Food-  The Nashville hot bun was awesome!  I had the first one and ordered a second- the fried chicken and ranch was a perfect combo  with dill pickles on top and a fresh soft bun. They did a great job with this dish.  The cheese curds were also great- my wife and her sister are suckers for all things cheese and they can't wait to come back for more.  The fried chicken and biscuits was one of the best in Philly  better than federal donuts and Khyber pass pub (which is at the top of my list for philly pubs).  The beer brat bun was good  but I was just reminded that I am not a huge brat fan.  Good dish  but just not my thing. Drink- The cranberry Moscow mule was a hit with the ladies.  The happy hour Cabernet was good and the buds bourbon made a solid finish.  Their cocktail list looks great and I will be trying one of their signature old fashioneds next time.   The bartender was also really friendly and her service was great.  We will definitely come back soon.\n",
      "Fried chicken is excellent. I rarely eat breast meat  but I ate theirs. Good fries too. I was surprised how fast and pleasant the service is. Good selection of beers and cocktails. Altogether a very enjoyable lunch.\n",

      "Recently visited for dinner with my daughter when visiting her University. Ambiance was warm and interesting  a bit crowded  but that added to the positive vibe.  I started with west coast Oysters and My Boy Blue  enjoyed both tremendously. Followed with day boat Scallops  perfect. Then finished with warm Apple Tart and brown butter (caramel) Ice Cream  wonderful. My daughter kept it simple with Pork Tenderloin and finished with the chocolate Creme Brûlée. She was very pleased with both and stopped herself just short of licking the desert dish. Based on our experience and the positive comments herein  I plan to return for a weekend brunch. Well done White Dog.\n",
      "I love this place! For 2 reasons  1. My husband proposed to me there and 2. because of the amazing Brunch they have. I had the poached pear and pecan french toast and it was amazing! We sat by the window  which I definitely recommend because I'm not one for sitting in the middle of the room when I'm trying to have a nice intimate meal with someone. The service was very good  the wait staff seem to be very knowledgable about the menu. The decor is rugged with cute dog pictures everywhere. The only negative is that the brunch is so popular that there is always a line if you don't make a reservation. I am also a big proponent of Farm to Table establishments and this one definitely has brunch down to a tee!\n",
      "Gotta love White Dog. The food and service is reliably good and there are so many nooks of the restaurant  you always have a good amount of privacy.\n",
      "We got the chicken sandwich with broccoli rabe  side of salad and French fries.....and shrimp tacos and butternut squash soup with side salad.   Best thing we had from each of our entree were the butternut squash soup which was really flavorful and the French fries with garlic Parmesan and truffle oil. The chicken sand which tastes more burnt then the tasting the chicken or broccoli rabe.  Shrimp taco tasted very regular\n",
      "Mold! The hot dog we ordered had mold on the bun. If I'm paying $7.50 for a hotdog its gotta be really tasty  not the luke-warm plate of garbage we received.   The pepperjack burger was awesome but everything was overpriced. The management handled the moldy hotdog situation in a very friendly and professional way although we felt sick for the rest of the day.  Outside of all that the service wasn't great. We waited a really long time for the waitress to stop back and the hostess wasn't any help claiming our waitress was just busy  in a dismissive way.\n",

      "What happened to White Dog Cafe?  First time I was there for my friend Dan's 21st birthday and it was a great time.  My last time that I was there was last '09 Summer and it was terrible.  My girlfriend had ordered Meadow Run Spring Lamb ($29)  and there was barely any meat on there plus she asked for well-done and it was cooked rare.   I ordered Spicy Lamb Bolognese ($19) and it was nothing spectacular for the price.  It was mostly rigatoni noodles and not much seasoning.  I know that I could cook better than this expensive  worthless dinner.  Extremely disappointed.  Never again.  Go next door to New Deck Tavern for cheaper specials.\n",
      "Hello   Last night I had a wonderful meal (tuna tartar  duck  root beer float) and great service at White Dog. Here's why I'll never be back. I arrived with a group of 6 family members - we go a few times a year because it's convenient to 30th street station when my in-laws come to town. We were given menus - 4 of us were ordering priced fix. 2 were not. O wait  actually 0 are  because despite nothing noted on the menu  the new policy is that the priced fix meal must be ordered by the whole table  our server informed us kindly. We offered to be put on 2 checks. The manager came out and told us it was the chef's rule  \\for our own good and the good of our experience\\\" because it would be so hard for us to when to eat what if some people didn't have food in front of them. Stupid  but tolerable. And the priced fix options had $ next to them  so since they could be purchased a la carte  we got over it. And THEN we were told we couldn't have a LA carte from that special menu - even though the menu said \\\"items available a LA carte\\\" on the menu  because that's only available for groups smaller then 4. So my mother in law couldn't have the burrata. My sister in law couldn't have the scallops. What are you even thinking  White Dog? My table had ordered 2 bottles of wine  we were frequent visitors... I'm going to make it my job to tell everyone I know about my bad experience. Enough with the silly rules and stodginess from the lil cafe that use to be about quality in farm to table. You look like jerks.p\"\n",
      "This wonderful little spot in University City offers a charming ambiance and creative menu. At its heart  White Dog is a boutique date spot  quaint and intimate. It's almost like an upscale bed and breakfast. Attached is a great bar with balanced cocktails and a quality draft list. It's great for a classier happy hour with a lively atmosphere.\n",
      "When it comes to steak  I'm not easy to please. I'm probably one of the snobbiest carnivores around  so when I say that I'm blown away by a piece of beef  you know it's damn good. Well hats off to the Butcher & Singer chefs for literally serving me the best steak I've had in recent memory.   Started the meal with a blue-cheese stuffed olive martini - fantastic way to whet the palette - and noshed on some Oysters Rockefeller before splitting their Tomato & Onion and Butcher Salads. The former featured deliciously ripe tomatoes smothered in Roquefort Bleu Cheese and the most thinly sliced Vidalia onions  while the latter was a deliciously light chopped salad containing crisp lettuce  chickpeas  green beans  some sopressata salami  and various other ingredients that  although intimidatingly filling sounding at first  was a really light intro. The dressing was somewhat sweet  but not in an overwhelming way.   Then came the steak. We shared the 20oz. Porterhouse for two  priced reasonably at $74. It. Was. Awesome. Prepared perfectly medium-rare with a charred outer edge that was so flavorful  I literally stopped mid bite to pinch myself. No  I wasn't dreaming. Yes  it was real steak and yeah  it was THAT good. And the brussel sprout side? They are literally the tastiest green side i've ever had - they are almost deconstructed and served sauteed w/ applewood smoked bacon. The server actually said  \\I want to let you know that the brussel sprouts come with bacon  is that okay?\\\" I almost ordered a second serving when I heard that...   The decor of this steak house is also really enjoyable. It's in a massive space with high ceilings and though the lighting is pretty dim  it's not too dark like most steakhouses. There's a warmth about the place that makes eating here really comfortable. It also reminds me of one of those big band/swing joints you see in movies. I expected to see a live swing trio standing in individual booths there.  I think it's safe to say that this place may have just knocked Del Frisco's out of first place in my list of \\\"best steakhouses ever.\\\" If you're in Philly and have a craving for meat  Butcher and Singer is a must!\"\n",
      "Visited this place twice.  My boyfriend is a steak lover.  The hash browns are so good  they could feed four people.  Upscale  and not stuffy.  You can dress up or down.  A nice place to have celebratory meal.\n",
      "Absolutely amazing. Those were the first two words that came out of my mouth when my friends asked me how it was. The place is beautifully decorated and definitely a great place for a romantic dinner. Our waitress Suzanne was incredibly helpful and friendly. Keep in mind that if you go here  you're planning to spend money so comments about the high prices are superfluous  and high expectations of food and service are mandatory.  We started with the tuna sashimi which was absolutely divine - I would definitely order it again. The butcher salad was crisp and flavorful but nothing to write home about. I got the 12 oz filet mignon medium well but I would recommend going medium or rarer. Regardless it was still delicious. I preferred my boyfriend's dry aged porterhouse (very rare) which was probably the best steak he ever had. The random greens on the side seemed to be more for color on the plate than anything  but I think they should remove this altogether. The mushrooms and onions were so tasty  I wanted the recipe. The stuffed hash brown was impressive but heavily dairy based and the crispy edges were my favorite. We finished our meal with a baked alaska which was as delicious as everyone promised. We enjoyed our leftovers the next day. I heard their restaurant week is good too  and man is it tempting to go back this week just for that.\n",
      "I'm a big fan of butcher n singer. to me it's the best steak I've had in Philadelphia. I try to go a couple of times year. I recently went and it never disappoints....actually my wallet was disappointed. tad bit overpriced imo.   i always end up getting the porterhouse for 2  of course shared amongst others but I really could eat the whole thing. for the price I do think the porterhouse for 2 is a little small. it's always cooked to perfection. We also had the delmonico this time  which is a ribeye cut   and it was good but wasn't blown away by it. The lobster Mac n cheese is by far the best side and the portion is generous with plenty of lobster meat. My Caesar salad was a little under dressed and nothing spectacular. Asparagus side was a little bland also.   the service is pretty good and the environment is great. really feels like an upscale old school steakhouse but definitely not snobby.  When people ask me where to get steak I always send them to butchers!\n",
      "Visited family for weekend 2 months ago and had to eat here. I'm new to Yelp  but my daughter suggested that I have an account since me and my husband are such foodies and I'm quick to give an honest review.:)My husband loves the steak here. Professional staff. Courteous waiter. Delicious food   they never fail! My husband got the Delmonico cooked medium. Nice and tender according to him. I got the swordfish with a side of Brussels sprouts. So good! It's worth the money. I have no issue paying good money for excellent food  service  and ambiance. Our go to dinner date place whenever we are back visiting.\n",

      "Bitcher and singer is a dinner place and it is in a perfect location on rittenhouse square. Perfect for any night on the town to Philly. I came here in August and wanted to rate my experience on this place.  K- the place was clean  it is a top of the line steakhouse  the bathrooms were really clean as well!   I- the hostess and the server represented the place well. They were all very professional.  S- the service was decent. The food came out at a good time. However  they weren't very attentive with us as far as our drinks go. They didn't fill up our waters as much as we desired.  S- I got the filet mignon and it was TO DIEEE FOR. It was a great steak and it was amazing. The sides were good too and for desert I had the baked Alaska and that was amazing as well. For a fancy steakhouse the price wasn't bad and it was actually much cheaper than Gordon's restaurant in Las Vegas.  Overall a fabulous place to dine and perfect location to drink at bars after and have fun  )\n",
      "You will NOT be disappointed! My husband and I go here often  and love it every time. While he is definitely a steak guy who loves the Delmonico  I do not eat red meat and yet enjoy the food just as much. The salmon is my favorite  and the sides are amazing as well. As for dessert  I am usually a chocolate person  but the Baked Alaska is a must-try!  Service is always impeccable and the atmosphere is cool  you feel like you're in an old mob movie or something.   Yes it is a bit pricey  but if you're willing to spend the money than it is definitely worth it. One of our top picks in the city!\n",
      "Portions are huge and the prices are so reasonable for the entire package  delicious food  beautiful yet unpretentious ambiance  great service Loved it all. Would definitely go back!\n",
      "We tried the good dog because it was featured on Diners  Drive-ins  and Dives. This joint is definitely a dive. We visited at 1:30 in the afternoon on a Saturday and it was extremely loud and rowdy. Basically if you are over 26 years old you will not fit in nor will you enjoy it. I am giving it 2 stars because in spite of this the food was good. The Thai meatballs are excellent and you get a generous portion of sweet potato fries with the sandwiches. Service was very good as well. If I were 21 years old I'd probably give it 4 stars.\n",
      "Summary: Great food  trendy ambiance  awesome place!  This has got to be one of my favorite places in Philly.  Ever since I saw this on Food Network's Diners  Drive Ins  and Dives back in 2010  I knew that I had to head to the place to try out the trendy menu highlighted by Guy Fieri.  Who's ever had a duck pot pie?  Or a buffalo shrimp po' boy?  Even if you have  you need to come here once and learn about it all over again.  Having made this a staple part of my Sunday evening routine last year  I unfortunately had to back off for a while due to other happenings over the past few months.  That being said  a few weeks ago  I was lucky enough to head back there with a few of my good friends.    The wings - phenomenal.  They have to be one of the best that I've ever had the privilege of tasting.  Yeah  it's a privilege here.  The fries (sweet potato and regular mix) - amazing.  The veggie burger - amazing.  One of my friends ended up having the calamari and the shrimp po' boy  both also fantastic by his admission.  He did mention that the calamari was slightly greasy  but after all  this is a bar.  You need bar food  right?  Honestly  I'm really hard pressed to find something that I don't like about the place.  Maybe the only downside is how crowded it always is...?  Jessica O'Donnell has created a fantastic place right in the heart of Center City Philadelphia  and whether you're a student in Philly  just a regular resident  or just passing through - this should be one of your stops.\n",
      "The Good Dog Bar was a perfect lunch pre-game spot before Made in America. We had the wings (amazing korean bbq style)  magic hat beers and PBR's. And the sweet potato fries were amazing! The waitress was friendly and we will definitely go back when we are in Philly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Went here for lunch on a weekday. Service was great. Loved the dog pictures on the wall. The Good Dog Burger itself was really good  however the fries that came with it was subpar. Maybe I got a batch that was at the end of the bag. However  I will def be coming back.\n",
      "Burgers + beer + dogs = recipe for success  This place is a staple for happy hour among my new coworkers and I finally understand why. Upon walking in  you're met with a typical bar set up (stools  booths  dark atmosphere). However  climbing up to the second floor  you find restaurant tables set up with another bar and the kitchen. The third floor doesn't have a bar  but you will find a pool table and plenty of space for milling about with a group. I was impressed by the draft beer selection for such a seemingly small place  but what really sold me was the burger. Very grateful to my coworkers' peer pressure because I've legitimately dreamt about the Good Dog burger since then. Raclette cheese-stuffed with caramelized onions and crispy fries was the perfect complement to my beers. I can't wait to go back with my crew of coworkers  but maybe we won't sit next to the \\Memorial Wall\\\" of pups past...\"\n",
      "The bf and I have been here a few times before and sat at the bar for a few drinks. They have a good beer list.  Yesterday we decided to try the food. It was packed on a Wednesday night at 8pm so I thought this place would live up to the hype. We ordered the arugula salad  the fried tomato blt and the duck pot pie.   The arugula salad was just a big bowl of arugula. I expected some additional toppings like at most restaurants but I ate it cuz I was hungry.   The fried tomato blt was very mediocre  which saddens me because I didn't think anything with bacon could ever be this disappointing. There was way more bread than filling  and the fried tomatoes were tiny and mostly breading. It was really nothing special as I could make a better blt at home. It did come with the mix of sweet potato and yukon gold fries and those were really good. However  the waitress put down what she called chipotle aioli and it was really bland--no chipotle flavor whatsoever.   My boyfriend loves anything with duck  and he loves pot pie  so the obvious choice for his was the duck pot pie. He barely ate any because it just didn't taste right to him. I   Maybe it was an off night or maybe there's just too much hype for this place. We left hungry and very disappointed.\n",
      "I'm vegetarian  but can follow meat-eaters here when I want something other than a veggie burger. The macaroni and cheese dish was good -- actually the accompanying blueberry cornbread was amazing  and the mac and cheese was OK.\n",
      "After hearing rave reviews about the burger at Good Dog  I had to give it a try. I went with the Traditional Burger dressed up by some delicious cheddar from the long list of cheese options. While the included fries come as a blend of regular and sweet potato  you can specify only one type - I preferred the regular as the sweet potato ones were a little too dry.\n",
      "We came for the burgers (magazine article said best in the state) and the bar was busy and small  just want you want. Surprisingly (because of the busy and small) we had awesome service with full menu and beers. He even knew about gluten free items for our party. We also had a philly appetizer that was unique. The burger itself wasn't the \\best I've ever had\\\" per the article  but it was really good.\"\n",
      "Yummy yummy yummy. We sat at the coffee bar with Janilex - she was awesome and so down to earth and friendly  even on a busy Saturday afternoon. We had the Gallo Pinto with vegan chorizo  Mixto Criollo  Cubano and vegetarian omelet. I could have done w o the vegan chorizo and the cubano was a little dry  but all else  amazing. Hot sauce  also amazing. Bloody Marys and Tres Leches  We've found a new go-to brunch spot in Philly.\n",
      "Rule #1 to finding a great brunch spot in any unknown city:  find the gay neighborhood and walk for 3 blocks!  From my experiences  this rule applies to San Francisco  San Diego  and now Philadelphia.  Mixto was a surprise  and I must say it was nice to have a great Sunday brunch with a large party and not have to wait in line for it.  I had some dish that isn't on any of the online menus I've seen--maybe they've recently changed?!--it had a little bit of everything.  Eggs  spicy rice & beans  steak & onions  sweet plantains  and oh yeah  a brick of fried cheese.  Yeah  that's right  deep fried f'n cheese.  Everything was delicious.  It was a bummer I didn't get a chance to try any of their drinks--unfortunately  this time I was with the wrong crowd for that.  I did have a cafe con leche that was amazing.  Either way  it was nice to find a brunch that comes with hot sauce.\n",
      "I am in love with this place. Great atmosphere  awesome food and mojitos and wonderful service. A big shout out to our server Jesús for being amazing! :-)\n",
      "This is more like a 3.5 (which is not offered by Yelp).   The food was really good  but they're certainly taking advantage of being in this neighborhood because it was pretty expensive for the amount of food you get.  We were only here for happy hour (BAR ONLY  which is lame because some of my favorite restaurants offer it to all of the tables as well)  but we  had the guacamole and the Plato Mixto (Arepas  empanadas  chicharrones  chorizo  shrimp ceviche  tostones  maduros and papa relleno).  So far this is the only restaurant I've seen put guacamole on the happy hour menu  but that's the only time I would get it because it was smaller than my favorite \\modern Mexican\\\" restaurant's serving for the same price  $12 (regular price at Mixto  but is $6 during happy hour).  They only include the beer menu if you sit at the bar. They're clearly trying to sell you their $10+ cocktails (normal for around here).   The service was standard for any other restaurant. Nothing to rave about. I found myself wondering why my water wasn't refilled (because I drink a lot of water when it's hot out)  but I didn't have to request more. It was refilled in enough time.   The Plato Mixto was not as big as I expected for $24. It was wasn't* tiny  but I think $18-20 would've been more appropriate. The chorizo was great  the empanadas were good  I could live without the chicharrones ((never had it (from anywhere)  but it was just fried pork fat that was really tough to eat  nothing special  would not order by itself))  and the shrimp ceviche was awesome (also never had this from anywhere  but this made me want to order it elsewhere when it's available).  I saw the waiters bring out entrees to other people  and they looked great. I'll eventually come back  but I'm not dying to go back tomorrow.\"\n",
      "To be fair I haven't been in the past year or more. But across  the board Mixto is a disappointment.  My Cuban better-half and I tried it a couple of times  once alone  once with friends who wanted to go. The food  for latin cuisine  was remarkably bland. Latin food uses simple ingredients and it's all about developing flavors and building on those simple components. Mixto's food was largely flavorless. Like they just squeezed a lime over it and called it 'latin.' The moros (rice cooked with beans) was completely devoid of flavor.   Only go if you are absolutely desperate for latin food.\n",
      "Mixto is a gayborhood staple in Philly.  It has a lively ambience and the food was great. Looks can be deceiving  though.  During my visit to Mixto  I probably had one of the worst service experiences I've had  and unfortunately after our meal we heard similar experiences from friends.    We visited later evening on a Saturday night  where the restaurant was full and lively.  We were seated on the first floor fairly quickly and near the open door/windows for a nice  airy dinner.  As we sat  the busboy came over and filled our water glasses.  However  the server was nowhere to be seen...  After about 20 minutes  and 2 or 3 glasses of water  we were greeted by our server.   More often than not  once a server notices you  things are generally smooth sailing...not this time. It took 20 more minutes for our margaritas to arrive  and another 10-15  minutes after that for our appetizers to arrive. Our server did not check on us. (He was actually cleaning the air ducts with a stick and a towel on the end of the stick  which was thankfully not near our table.) We'd now been seated for about an hour  and only gotten to our appetizers.   All in all  food was OK.  House Margaritas not great.  Service was downright horrendous.    Let's hope this place gets it together or I won't be back.\n",
      "Another great meal at a restaurant in Philadelphia! More and more this city is impressing me with its culinary prowess...but I digress  My fiancé and I decided to check out Mixto for some Sunday afternoon brunch. I didn't know this before coming to the restaurant  but Mixto actually specializes in Cuban/Colombian cuisine (pretty much Latin inspired dishes).   Mixto has a very \\homey\\\"  comfortable atmosphere to it. The very first thing I had to have was coffee with cream  or \\\"cafe con leche\\\". The coffee was excellent  and gave me a nice boost throughout the day. For brunch  I had to go with the heuvos rancheros  considering we were at a Latin inspired restaurant. The eggs came with a creole sauce  refried beans  tortilla chips  and I choose chorizo (one of like 4 meat options).   The eggs were very good  and definitely kicked up a notch with the creole sauce on top. The chorizo was also enjoyable to. But I found the tortilla chips to be the best part of the dish! They were so fresh and crunchy  clearly these were made in house. I found the best way to eat this dish was to top a chip with some eggs  beans  and a little piece of chorizo  a great combo overall! My fiancé got the veggie frittata  which looked very good but I didn't try it so I can't say more than that.  We both really enjoyed our meals here  and now look forward to coming back for dinner!\"\n",
      "I was visiting a friend in the city last night and we decided to get a bite to eat. What a great find! we were seated inside  right by the open window and it was perfect.  I told our waiter Jesus  to pick a good margarita for me... and he did - a \\skinny margarita\\\"  nothing skinny about it! My friend tried a couple of beers. We had the Tostones Bruschetta for an appetizer  something new and different for both of us - we enjoyed it. My friend had the Vegetarian Paella and I had a chicken and rice Cubano. The servings were HUGE! It seemed like the more I ate  the rice multiplied  it didn't even look like I put a dent in it. I highly recommend the restaurant  great food atmosphere and attentive staff!!!\"\n",
      "Started off my brunch with a Peach Mimosa. Delicious. Then I ordered the Mexican Breakfast which was absolutely to die for!   They give you a complimentary bread that was toasted in butter...so it was warm with just the right amount of crisp to it. Our waitress was attentive and welcoming and the service is \\right on the money\\\" as they say.   The Mexican Breakfast was pretty filling and beautifully plated. The mimosa was about $8 that came in a nice champagne glass. However  I think around $5 would be a more reasonable price.   It was my first visit and I definitely want to go back to try more of their dishes. One of friends had a sirloin steak with eggs and toast and it looked just as good as mine.\"\n",
      "Other than the noise level being a bit higher than I would normally like  the food was awesome  had a beyond wonderful server and the decor was simplistic yet charming. A great place if you're in a festively active mood. I'll definitely be back here.\n",
      "This place was ah-mazing! We got the all you can eat Bbq and the food just keeps coming. This is a better  more intimate version of hibachi  just on a bbq grill. They also have an all you can eat noodle option that is really cool too! My favorite part was the Asian sauce bar  where there's an array of sauces and spices you can use to spice up your meal. The ice green tea is the best I've ever tasted too. I will be back!\n",

      "All you can eat hotpot and BBQ  opened in 2016. Great spot for some debaucherous eating  not for those concerned about their figure. Pro tip: go crazy with the sauce station.\n",
      "Philly was severely lacking any kind of AYCE Korean/Chinese BBQ  so this was definitely a great addition. The food is fine  the interior is fine  and the selection is fine - everything was just fine. Nothing stood out to be particularly  but nothing was terrible (except 1 thing we ordered as I'll explain below).  So  my friend and I got the AYCE BBQ (you can also do Hotpot as well but we did not opt to do so). The food is cooked in front of you by someone who comes by / sticks around for a long time (did we feel kinda weird that our conversations were pretty personal? a bit) - but she was real nice and didn't really seem to care about what we were saying. The food cooks on what i THINK is an infrared system  so there's no real fire. That makes for 1. less smoke (and therefore your clothes dont smell like food TOO much) and 2. a weird  non-charred cook  which I personally like on bbq.  Well  the house steak and short ribs were both great. The short ribs were a bit too fatty for my liking - if there was a real fire maybe this would have rendered a bit more and have been actually somewhat marginally appetizing  but alas it was not. My friend who was a complete noob with chopsticks also had a hard time eating this. The curried chicken breast was not something I would ever recommend. Tasted TOO much like cumin. Like just cumin. mmm. no good.  You can also make your own sauce - I just did equal parts soy sauce  garlic and sesame oil and it was great.  Overall  this place is a great place that you should DEFINITELY try. Just come hungry!\n",
      "Not actually Korean at all. Zero Korean wtiting  appetizers  or ... Food. False advertising.\n",
      "Hubby and I went here on a Friday night. The service was pretty good- our sever steadily tended to our BBQ- and gave really good suggestions for which meats and veggies to order. Hubby wasn't feeling 100%  so I got a half spicy/ half plain hot pot for him- with shrimp  thin sliced beef  and chicken. I got a small bowl of the best rice I have had in a long time. I also got lamb  curry chicken  and chicken wings. All of these meats were bbq'ed. There was wayyyy more food than we could finish  but I managed to polish off a majority of the BBQ. Thank God for a fast metabolism!   Some quick notes about the food:  1. I got udon noodles with my hot pot which was a good idea because they never got soggy.  2. I like that I got a wide spread so that I know what to get next time without wasting food or money.  3. Try the different sauces and condiments.  4. Seaweed salad  kimchi  boiled peanuts  and edemame make up the appetizer.\n",
      "First time ever trying Korean barbecue. We had no idea what to expect. My 7 year old and I loved the little appetizers in the beginning  especially the peanuts. We've decided this is not our cup of tea. We prefer to pay someone to cook our food so it will be of the right temperature. We asked the waitstaff for help and we didn't feel very reassured. We loved the sausage  chicken and rib tips. We overcooked the steaks and didn't care for the wings.   I wouldn't suggest going on an empty stomach. And you better really like to cook.   The ambiance was great. Very cool tables.\n",
      "Hot pot and friends Fun times Beef veggies sausage  Haiku. Wut?!   Come one. Come all. Come for drinks and food and have a ball. Not a dance ball but a fun time. It's my birthday people it's my time to shine\n",
      "Worse Korean ever (raised in Korean home). First of all there is nothing Korean about this place. For those familiar with a Korean meal there was only 4 Banchan side dishes. Peanuts  seaweed  chewy kimchi and sad looking edamame. Meat selection was good however quite questionable when it arrived. After 15 minutes we finally had to ask for rice. Really?  Admittedly most appeared to be getting hot pot so maybe that's what you should do. If you don't know Korean bbq then you may not be surprised by the fare however that is depressing if this is what you are shown what Korean bbq should be.\n",
      "Love this new place in chinatown with incredible value on their hotpot. WE are not a big fan of their Korean BBQ bc we dont believe it tastes like korean bbq. But we wont hesitate to  go there for the hotpot. service is generally very good  sometimes you wont get all the items you ordered on ur first order so make sure you re-order them. sometimes there is a long wait so be mindful of that. we generally go during off peak hours and lunch\n",
      "The first taste of Cuba Libre I took was last year at the Atlantic City location.  For those familiar with the prices  quality  and menu items  this one is the same  aside from what is on the menu.  For this reason  I recommend planning accordingly by 1. Making a reservation  and 2. looking up the menu beforehand.  One tip:  Unlike Atlantic City  this location is smaller  yet it does have an upstairs.  With this said  there is a single unisex bathroom next to the bar and the other is upstairs.  I'm not taking off a star for this  although you will wait on a busy night.  We reserved our table for 7 PM which in restaurant lore is a practically untouchable hour.  Our time saver was the parking lot across the street.    Anyone who has ever been to any Cuba Libre *knows* that (certain) entrees are large enough for sharing.  Our party decided on the small plates over the entrees to accommodate later plans in the area.  We had the following:  Grilled octopus  spring rolls  Guava ribs  and Yuca fries.  Despite the next available table being 10 PM  our food was served within 20 minutes of our order.   The Yuca fries include a cilantro aioli which is a great accompaniment and aren't served so piping hot that you can't enjoy the taste. Highly recommend!  The spring rolls are stuffed with salami and other meats  although there are only two on this plate for $8.  I was looking forward to the grilled octopus which was updated from a previous dish with eggplant salad to a mango/tomato salad.  Our waitress was gracious enough to suggest the eggplant since she could tell I was not a fan of the new version.  And last but not least  the Guava ribs.  These completely blew me away. You can see in the picture how plump they are which reminded me of the ribs Victory makes with Golden Monkey sauce.  I have found the rival to those and whatever they make the sauce with besides Guava  I hope they keep doing.  All in all  our table was impressed with the selections.  Out of how filling  the ribs are the most  even if you want to take them home to savor.  Next time my party comes here  we're returning for the dancing later on  )\n",
      "Went here to dance and have a few drinks. Place was crowded fine no problem it's a saturday  but the bartender up stairs was aweful. She was more interested in dancing more than serving  waited 15 mins to order a drink and she totally ignored us. We left  couldn't get a single drink order equals bad bartenders l  I would say get a new one for upstairs and get rid of the dancing queen she's costing your place money or hire jack tapper to fix the place\n",
      "Stepping into the center of this restaurant feels like entering into the middle of a jungle. The atmosphere here is pretty fantastic. Trellises  vines  and wonderful lighting really set the scene for a great dining experience.  I visited Cuba Libre last weekend for brunch with a group of ten. Our server  Melissa  was sweet and helpful as can be. The service through the entire meal was impeccable  even though we were a large  chatty  and distracted table. Plates came out with wonderful timing  and we never felt rushed. Every plate was a hit. I wasn't starving  so I opted for just two: the crab cake with poached egg (perfect: crispy  savory  doused with an amazing oozing yolk)  and guacamole (oddly sweet with chunks of pineapple and nicely crunchy plantains). The girls next to me both had baby octopus as one of their dishes and said that they were great.   Olde City is an area that I generally avoid...but Cuba Libre brunch was a pleasant surprise!\n",
      "Accommodating to all special requests. Awesome service  chill environment. I was able to sit beside my husband and customize my paella. We love this place in Atlantic city and this location def lives up to its reputation.\n",
      "The restaurant definitely doubles as a dance club. The main dining area is located on the dance floor surrounded by the second floor balcony. The decor is fantastic and I could just imagine hearing the Latin music beats. The waiters and waitresses were all extremely friendly  attentive and helpful to our large group as we celebrated a friend's birthday.  The guacamole  served with long banana chips  had a unique tropical flavor. It was extremely good with a slight sweetness from perhaps mango. I would rate the specific dish that I had  but they change the menu about every 6 months. The food is good although I feel like it lacked proper seasoning  the pulled beef was cooked well and was tender. And if you feel like you can't make a decision  the tapas will definitely fill you up and give you a good selection of food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Took the family here for mother's day brunch.  The atmosphere ambience is great!  It gave you a relaxing feel while dining here.  We started off ordering the breakfast breads as an appetizer.  Mmm all the breads that came out were delicious as with the fruit spread and mango butter.  I had a Cafe Cuba Libre to drink as well  which is Cuban coffee with coconut milk and spiked with rum.  That was tasty as well.  The meal I ordered was the Cuban sandwich which was one of the tastiest Cuban's I have had.  I'm not a fan of pickles  but when they're in a Cuban  I like them...and this Cuban was fantastic.  Definitely check this place out!\n",
      "Went on Saturday night.  Be prepared to spend $18 on parking. Drinks were good and about 10-12 each. The Cuban sandwich was good. Worth 19.50? Not really.  My girlfriend got some tapas dishes. Those were not great. Very bleh. Plus they were all fried.  She was very disappointed. Also  the chips and 3 dips had soo few chips that barely used half the dip  then charged 3 bucks more for 4 more CHIPS.   Our table was also next to 2 bathrooms and the kitchen on the first floor. I overheard some people who worked there talking about our tables who said they shouldn't be there.  No kidding we watched everyone who went to the bathroom.  Very romantic view....Lol. I get it was busy but don't add tables outside the bathroom to compensate.\n",
      "this is what's wrong w/ sweet drinks..its sweet and it hides the alcohol flavors in your cocktail and you feel like you're just inhaling liquid candy..  ok  perhaps i'm exaggerating a little bit..  i didn't inhale liquid candy  i just..  consumed 2 glasses of classic mojitos in less than 10 minutes.  oh wait. no no  that's my friend...  i was good and ate my ribs for the first 5 minutes. THEN i finished my two glasses of mojitos in...15 minutes.. see how i'm good @ pacing myself?   as for the service  our bartender was friendly & sweet and obviously made a great drink. but they wouldn't seat us in the patio/ dining room because we weren't having dinner...  uh...excuse me..who has dinner @ 3pm?!?!  either way. good food. good drinks. but someone should tell that lady that eating dinner @ 3 in the afternoon is just ridiculous...\n",
      "Not from philly. Walking by  checked yelp and decided to trust the reviews. Good move.   Try the meatballs - awesome.  Empanadas - tasty but just a bit bready Sausage - outstanding Bread with mango butter - omg Mojitos- peach is ok  raspberry is wicked   Recommend the place. Ryan the server is very willing to help and suggest.\n",
      "This is a home run neighborhood brunch spot just north of City Center.  Avoid walking down 13th street since it is located in a fairly isolated and industrial spot of the city.  Once inside  the ambiance is cozy mixed with whimsy - coloful chalkboard specials  bright red plastic chairs  and jester-striped chandeliers.  Hipster waiters and waitresses add to the casual and fun vibe.  Plus the brunch is delicious.  Lemon Ricotta Pancakes: lemon ricotta baked fluffy pancakes  served with strawberries on top paired with a side of thick fresh whipped cream and honey as syrup.  It was like a sweet summer picnic on my plate.  Ham & Jalapeno Frittata: specially ordered with egg whites didn't deter this flavorful  spicy  and ultra cheesy dish.  Smoked ham  mushrooms  and cheddar are mixed with pico de gallo in this fluffy egg special.    With endless refills of strong Columbian dripped coffee to complement our meal  friendly service  and quick orders  this is hole-in-the-wall brunch at its finest.\n",
      "Loved it. They had a vegan panini sandwich that was to die for. My friends got the French today and the breakfast burritos and they loved them as well. Great vibe in this place  great food. Definitely a hip vibe in here and that makes it very easy to relax in this place and have a good time. I'm from Boston so having a nice cafe out here with a vegan option is awesome\n",
      "Wonderful.  Lemon ricotta pancakes were a delight  crab cake benedict was full of fresh  plump crab meat and topped with perfectly poached eggs.  Steak and egg tacos were just fine  but topped with a deliciously astringent house made hot sauce and candy-sweet Jersey corn.  The blintz will make you pre-diabetic in the best ways possible  I particularly enjoyed the tartness of the mandolin-sliced plums contrasted with the sweetness of the honey and the richness of the dairy.  Atmosphere can be unbearably loud packed  even in the afternoon  and prices are not cheap  but everything we ate was above average.\n",
      "It was a drizzly Saturday morning. I shut my umbrella and shuffled into Cafe Lift. The quaint hole in the wall cafe was bustling with people  even with the gloomy weather just a wall away.   I was happily joined by a group of friends  a total of nine  patiently awaiting a table. Ten minutes passed. Then twenty. Then thirty. Our hope for food kept diminishing as time passed. The manager was kind enough to pay us visits  telling us that they had a table done eating with the perfect capacity for us and that they were ready to get us eating the second the party had left.  The party would not leave. There is no blame that can be put on either group. The manager was courteous and apologetic. The customers were just enjoying the homey atmosphere.   But when the time came that they left  we finally sat down to a large crepe.  The apologetic and bashful manager stood next to our server  offering us some free food to mull us over as they prepared our meal.   When our dishes came out  we dived in. The crepe was a cascade of flavors  a tang of hazelnut paired with an airy cream. It was fluffy and made to perfection  with a blend of bananas and strawberries inside  sending the taste buds on an orgasmic rollercoaster of the sweet and savory to the crisp and fresh.   The rest of the food was good  too.\n",
      "Sadly disappointed  after reading the reviews I was excited to try Sunday brunch. Was told 35 minute wait  when they had several tables open and many people waiting. Ok maybe they were staggering seating due to shortage in wait staff im not sure. So 20 minutes later they went to sit my bf and myself at the counter I asked if we could have a table. The polite hostess said sure  and then proceeded to seat us at a table that had been available since we came in. Our waitress spent more time talking to a friend of hers at the counter and the other wait staff than attending to her tables. She had two tables around us complaining amongst each other about the lack of service. One table had to flag her down to get water and to go boxes. The table next to us kept trying to flag her down to get change for the tip  but instead gave up and left her a smaller tip as a result. I ordered the breakfast burrito which was bland and boring. My bf ordered the huevos rancheros which was good. The housemade hot sauce was the highlight of the food. It was tasty and a subtle hot that crept up on you but not that artificial hot. I do not see myself returning anytime soon.\n",
      "Came with my sister for brunch on Saturday morning. Okay  the place was full and busy but it didn't look understaffed  but my sister and I stood at the entrance looking lost for a while until someone decided to come up to us and find a table. From there  service was pretty awful  which is unfortunate because the french toast selections were great. I picked one of their brunch special french toasts and after what felt like a 20 min wait  a plate of the wrong french toast was delivered to me (which I didn't realize until a server came and took the plate away and said it was the wrong one). After that  it took another 10-15 min wait to have our table cleared and once the check was dropped  our server was practically missing and we sat around for another 20 mins until they came back to pick it up.  I'd definitely give the place another try just for their french toast.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm afraid to say it  but I believe Cafe Lift just jumped to the top of the list of my favorite brunch spots (sorry Sabrina's). Clean  industrial trendy atmosphere with plenty of seating. There has been a little bit of a wait the last 2 times I was here  despite having open tables (short staffed?). But once you're seated you'll be glad you waited! On my last visit I enjoyed the breakfast burrito very much. It's probably at least double a standard portion size  but after a big night out you will gobble it all up without a second thought. Gooey filling with eggs  cheese  mushrooms and peppers. Perfection. I've also ordered Jen's Crespelle. It's everything you could want in breakfast rolled into a delicious crepe- sweet  savory and hearty. The cannoli French toast looks to die for  I will definitely be ordering that next time. Side note- remember to bring cash!\n",
      "Been here twice. No interest in returning any more.  For some reason -- I've yet to determine  -- this breakfast and lunch eatery is OVERRATED  definitely! My specifics: first time here my \\Rival Bros. Drip coffee \\\" Was FAIR only. Re: \\\"free refills\\\" noted on the menu  what's the point if the coffee doesn't taste  good  is lukewarm  & it's for one patron only???  Cannoli French Toast was my \\\"dish\\\" (I ordered it after seeing quite a few positive yelp reviews about it)  this was ALSO FAIR  though.  To my mind it was just a Sugary mess  for the most part. After this initial UNIMPRESSIVE run  I ONLY returned because this place is only a few minutes from my apartment  I also convinced myself given its proximity& that I'd been here once only  I should give it another shot.   So I did. Here's what happened that time. I started off ordering orange juice but that was borderline LUKEWARM  only! When I told the waitress she said it HAD been refrigerated. I didn't want to argue Si I asked for some ice  only. That turned out to be a FAIL  though cause it just watered it down. Smoked salmon on a bagel was my \\\"entree.\\\"  Though the salmon didn't seem 100% fresh the too large portion aggravated me more. \\\"Chefs\\\"should know how much food to put on their patrons' plates  so I'm usually disappointed (pissed really) when they don't. (That's a commonplace American dining \\\"thing\\\" that's hard to overlook  unfortunately.)  *Sorry  no pictures. I didn't feel like talking any.\"\n",

      "On first glance  Sabrina's exterior in the middle of the crowded Italian Market won't attract us  but based on a recommendation a friend (and Yelp)  we decided to come in for a brunch. My husband ordered the Huevos Rancheros and I ordered the Turkey Bacon White Egg Frittatas. Both food were delicious! My husband said his portion was good for the price  and although he was full  it didn't leave him as stuffed as green eggs always have. My frittatas was good and yummy. Their potatoes were out of this world! (Beat Chhaya & Green Egg hands down). Their menu is rather sizeable  but didn't leave us confused for 2 hours deciding what we wanted to eat (lol). We sat outside and the atmosphere was beautiful  servers were pretty nice as well :) will definitely come back!\n",
      "Great local cafe in the heart of the Italian Market in Philadelphia. Sabrina's Cafe serves an eclectic menu where breakfast  served all day  is the star. I started out with a hummus platter plated with fresh hummus  roasted red peppers  olives  cucumber  and pita (minus the feta). For lunch I ordered the Vegan Brunch. Three corn tortillas  seitan  roasted vegetable salad with bell peppers  carrots  red onions  zucchini  guacamole  pico de gallo  and a side of fresh fruit. A great place to take your non-vegan friends with lots of options sure to delight all palates.\n",
      "After quick review  I was completely into the idea of trying everything on the menu at Sabrina's. A friend and I ordered two dishes from the Brunch menu: chocolate chip pancakes with shortbread cookie crumbles and raspberry-chocolate chip sauce  and the stuffed French toast (filling of cream cheese  Reese's cups  grape jelly).   The pancakes not only lacked chocolate chips  but were also extremely dry - something I'd compare to leather. The shortbread crumbles would have been a nice touch if they hadn't been stale. The french toast was equally as dry as it's pancake cousin. The filling tasted purely of cream cheese  and the only element of sweetness was contributed by the grape jelly which did not compliment the dish whatsoever.   After tasting each dish I covered each with the two sauces which had come with the breakfast. Neither sauce did anything to enhance the dishes.   I was thoroughly disappointed with my first Sabrina's experience  mainly because I was blown away by the eclectic menu and I expected much more. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone  however I am giving Sabrina's the benefit of the doubt by assuming my experience was just a total fluke (maybe from the high dining volume that particular morning). I would give Sabrina's one more try  because I don't want to prematurely  accept that such a cool spot could consistently put out less than mediocre food.\n",
      "Great place for Brunch. Groovy atmosphere with Drexel students. Would strongly recommend this place for brunch breakfast. Make a reservation 30 mins prior to your arrival.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been meaning to get around this for like 2 months.  I have been subjected to Sabrina's 3 times.  Each time it it was because somebody came from out of town and insisted we go there.  The food is just fine but the servers blow.  I swear that the help wanted ads for this place reads  \\Miserable hipster bitches on year-long periods need apply.\\\"  Two in particular  one we call the Wookie bc she's 10 feet tall with shitty hair and talks like she has an inner ear infection and the other one who insists on showing everybody the gay tattoos on the back of her legs.  We call her Death-Skank. Just awful service with snarky attitudes from them both.  I know this review will probably get deleted but this place needs to know that some of these chicks are just pure cancer.  Sabrina's will be packed every Sunday morning no matter who is working there but let somebody else have the opportunity to make their rent in one day  somebody who is appreciative and actually has people skills.  Send these two shit-heads packing.\"\n",
      "Went here for breakfast. The entrance is a little odd. Came here on a Wednesday morning around 9:20. Not too crowded. We got the stuffed challah French toast which was amazing. The stuffing is this delicious maple banana creme cheese. It was fabulous. Perfect portion. We also had the huevor rancheros which is also a large portion. Didn't want to leave without finishing it because it was too good.   Overall great service  great food  and great proportions. Would definetly recommend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was my first time here and it was great. I had a large party with me but the wait for a table was just 5-10 minutes. The server was very attentive and accomodating (we had some special diet requests). The food itself was incredibly delicious. They have several vegetarian options to choose from  which awesome because I'm vegan. I had the grilled vegetable sandwich which was awesome except that it comes with mozarella cheese. If you're vegan  make sure you specify no cheese. Overall this was a great place and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Philly.\n",
      "Best french toast ever.  I got the challah french toast stuffed with banana cream cheese delciousness.  Four huge pieces of challah bread w/ vanilla infused maple syrup.  I had to take half of it home.  I've also tried the sweet potato fries... they're about average.  But  Jesus  that french toast.  The second time I went was for lunch  I got the mango tofu.... It was meh.  Much better at Banana Leaf in chinatown and about the same price.   The atmosphere is cute-sy.  Good service.  Nice outdoor seating. Try it!\n",
      "I've been wanting to try this place ever since I heard it was taking over the Bonte spot.  Stopped in on an off hour on a Sunday.  I had the half crab  half lobster  not the combo.  It's not on the menu  but I asked if I could do that because I was doing take out and had drinks at home.  Each roll was put in its own hot dog looking container.  When I got home I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of seafood on both sandwiches.  I had to use a fork to eat some of it.  The butter and the spices are a great  simple combination.  My only complaint is that I wish I had more because it was really good and not super filling.  Need to go back with a friend to try one of the big combos.\n",
      "The service was fast and good  lobster roll came out fast and fresh. 16.5 for a lobster roll is a steal. great place  great food and great people\n",
      "Hands down one of the best rolls I've ever had! I had the taste of main which gives you 1 2 rolls of shrimp  crab and lobster! OMG the seasoned butter is everything. The Customer service is superb! From the young lady at the register (African American with a head wrap) to the gentleman cooking food (possibly Caucasian with glasses)  greeted people as they entered  came out to ask all of the customers how everything was. I'll be back. My new go to when I come to Philly!\n",
      "Great  quaint atmosphere. Little loud because of its size. Service is friendly. My hubby and I split the taste of Maine  crab  lobster  and shrimp roll  2 crab claws  soda (which is local bottled colas)  pickle  and kettle chips. Great to get a mix and see what you like. It was large for one  but not enough for two if you are a big eater. My hubby went back and ordered a lobster roll because he liked it so much.\n",

      "Inexpensive  surprisingly fresh and delicious  low calories. We had the Lukes TrIO  lobster bisque  clam chowder.  Simple menu  friendly  hip staff  cape cod wharf decor  Very good  the rolls remind me of the bread of grilled cheese  Byob  A+  Not a negative  but for the special seasoning ddid't seem right on the shrimp roll  for me  it left an odd aftertaste. But on the lobster and crab roll it seemed to fit perfectly  again  that's just me.  Give it a try  we will definitely come back for more\n",
      "The lobster and crab rolls are VERY good.  The shrimp roll tasty  but I am a lobster and crab fanatic.  Every time I've been in there the staff is pleasant and upbeat and the order is prepared in a timely manner.  Delivery is available after 5:00PM  so I often call my order in to be delivered right before I leave the office for the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lobster sandwich was COLD!!  That was a surprised but I was more surprised that I still like it!  The lobster roll was tasty and the meat was tender.  Not seasoned too much.  I order the clam chowder.  The chowder was average.  Actually tasted canned but I know it wasn't.  Another great thing about this location is they deliver to a limited range.  It was late and I order delivery to the hotel lobby.  It was delivered in about 30 minutes.  The bike rider was friendly and the order was correct.    I would recommend this restaurant.\n",
      "This was my second time at Devon. I ordered the lobster bisque soup  which was delicious. I ordered the lobster Cobb salad as my entree. It was a big salad and was very good (a good amount of lobster). Oh and I can't forget the yummy  warm biscuits! Doug was our waiter and he was very nice.\n",
      "The food is amazing  the cocktails delicious  and the service great. HOWEVER  the restaurant was BOILING HOT! There are these floodlights that were beating down on me. I was literally dripping sweat. My glass on the table was under the light and all the ice had melted  whereas the water glasses of the other people at my table still had ice in them. I looked around the restaurant and saw people at other tables with sweat dripping off of them. I switched seats temporarily with someone at my table and they couldn't sit in my seat for more than 5 minutes. When we said something to the server he said \\yeah  join the rest of us\\\"  and another server on the way out said that this is something they frequently talk to the manager about  but has not yet been fixed. I was so miserably hot and uncomfortable I couldn't focus on how delicious the food was.\"\n",
      "My favorite seafood restaurant!!! Great service. Greater food. I have a good time everytime I go. I recommend the lobster bisque of course as well as the duck flatbread  crabcakes  and the surf-n-turf.\n",

      "A fun bar scene for happy hour.  The happy hour menu is great to pick/mix/share with a friend or two.  Oysters are great.  And the happy hour prices for the bar menu are very reasonable.  Don't look to save any money on drinks  however  as pricey as you will find in the already pricey Rittenhouse area. The regular bartenders are good with a little attitude though.  The new bartenders need some work.  I am a frequent bar customer  had dinner in the restaurant section once  where the food is average or just above  and the service is average or just below.  See ya at the bar  no reason to have a sit down.\n",
      "Devon does not disappoint. I've been here for lunch  restaurant week and dinner.  I love the venue and I was so excited to bring the bf here. Food was fantastic and even though I'd been here before  it was just as good as I'd remembered it to be a few years back.   The amount of food we ate was overwhelming and perfection in every way imaginable. While I enjoyed EVERYTHING from the yummy biscuits to the delicious shrimp and mussels.. I will NOT forget the Butternut Squash Risotto. OH MY. that's all there really is to say about that because it gave me LIFE.   Our server was a gem and she made the evening perfect by being so attentive and personable. She really knew her stuff when it came to the wine list which was impressive and was genuinely happy to let us try different wines to find a great pairing for the evening.  To finish this perfect dinner  we had a chocolate lava cake (with a candle for the bfs bday.. yay!). Definitely a favorite of mine and I would love to come back and try out a happy hour.\n",
      "Good food but expensive   for the price they could add a bit more to the menu and the serving sizes  great place and friendly staff... Do not take your date for a walk in the park because the rats are bigger than you are\n",
      "I ate here last Friday for restaurant week lunch with my coworkers. One of my coworkers is a really picky eater  so we picked this place reasoning that if she didn't like something off the restaurant week menu  she could always order something plain off the regular menu. We were a little disappointed when we sat down and they told us we all had to either order off the restaurant week menu or the regular menu. We ended up deciding on restaurant week. Some of my favorite selections were the mushroom risotto balls  the meatballs  and the pistachio cannoli. The decor is really cute and homey- fitting for an intimate Italian restaurant. Overall  the experience was pretty average.\n",

      "We had a great meal here.  The spaghetti  and meet balls were fantastic.  My wife really loved the lazagna  it is months later and she still talks about it.\n",
      "The service was very good.  Unfortunately  I didn't enjoy one dish.  The broccoli rabe was far too bitter for my liking.  I know broccoli rabe is bitter by nature  but it was pungent.  The bruschetta was so oily. The spaghetti and meatballs were cooked wonderfully  but had an extremely surprising  and unwelcoming smokey flavor.  This restaurant could be pretty great  with the romantic ambiance....However  the food and drinks seem to be trying way too hard to be different.  Everything was VERY fragrant and SALTY.  I don't get the amazing reviews?  I suppose the food and drink could just not be my taste?\n",
      "I really don't like to double up on restaurants unless they are the best of the best. In a city like Philadelphia there are so many amazing places that when you average a dinner out once a week you're sure to miss a ton if you start going to the same spots over and over again. That being said when my mother popped in a bit unexpectedly I decided I'd like to take her to LN's even though I'd been therea few months earlier.    My first time here was fine  the service was great  my drinks were plentiful and the mussels we awesome. My meal was ok but all in all it made for a fine night. This second time around things were a bit different.   Our party of five arrived at 8:00 and we were promptly sat. After pouring our water and giving us our menus we waited about ten minutes or so before our drink orders were taken. With my family this is a cardinal sin. You can wait on the food but don't keep our drinks from us! We got a bottle of wine and a few of us got cocktails. Then we waited again before we ordered appetizers. We asked that the garlic bread come out when it was was ready however this ended up being at the same time as our entrees. I went with the spaghetti and meatballs just as I had the first time I'd been there. It was fine  I wish we would have had some more cheese to sprinkle on top to enhance the flavor. The best dish was probably the clams and linguine my little brother got. If I make it back here this will most likely be my play along with the mussels.   The food was fine  everyone loved the decor and atmosphere but boo summed up our waiter perfectly when she said he was half-assed. Out of any of the Turney / Saffron spots I've been this is the first time I've ever had half assed service.\n",

      "This place has a great location for the hungry tourist. It manages to be edgy yet chill at the same time. My reason for stopping in was to try the ahi fish tacos with avocado relish  which sounded awesome. At around 3 there was still a healthy amount of people attesting to its popularity and eatability. They had a selection of local microbrews (bottle  not draft) for those interested in getting a taste of Philly in beer form. Alas  I ordered my tacos  but had a little Scooby Doo moment when the arrived. Somehow the chef decided that it was okay to put such a delicate fish in premade taco shells...enough to makes this SoCal girl wince a little and question whether I should consume. Luckily the flavor of the fish was great. I only saw one half inch cube of avocado  but at least the sauce was yummy!  I got a glimpse of the brunch menu...looks pretty tasty I must say...\n",
      "I LOVE JONES. Honestly.....  I was introduced to Jones at the YEE earlier this year. The food was divine. Comfort food to the max. Mac and Cheese that I could've eaten with a ladle  sliders  pigs in a blanket  delicious cocktails. Yum yum gimme some.  We came back with my mother and fell in love again. The calamari is the best calamari I've had in quite some time. Perfectly crisp  not rubbery  full of flavor. Yum.  For dessert? I had the Duncan Hines slice of yellow cake and glass of milk. Genius.  We came back AGAIN a few weeks ago when a friend was visiting from LA. I had the Seared Ahi Tuna. The husband had the Halibut. Our friend had the Roast Beef Dinner. Our friend won when it came to food selection. My belly was so warm and happy after one bite of his roast beef. The meat was succulent  juicy  the perfect medium rare. The mashed taters were creamy with a slight hint of garlic. Mmmm.  I preferred my husband's halibut over my tuna. The tuna was good  but the halibut had more flavor  IMO.  Can't wait to go back again. Yum yum yum.\n",

      "I'm not really sure why I bother going to other restaurants.   Every Valentine's Day I try to find some cute  new little BYO for me and my boyfriend to try out and I spend weeks scouring menus and Yelp reviews.   Every year SOMETHING goes wrong and I get frustrated and pissed off and he always says \\Let's go to Jones\\\".  This year was no different. We went out last night (2/12/11...the weekend before Valentines Day) to the BYO I picked out and when I made our reservations  no mention was made that they had a special fixed menu that night consisting SOLELY of seafood  which I am allergic to. As I started to get upset at our table  my boyfriend said \\\"Let's go to Jones\\\".  We got there  were told there was a little bit of a wait  so we sat at the bar for a drink. About 5-10 minutes later they came and got us and sat us at our table. Our waiter (who was WONDERFUL and looked like Jared Leto - extra bonus-) came over and took our order and the food came out perfectly (as usual) and right on time.  We both got the filet  done rare and the spinach it came with was fantastic. The mac and cheese is also an app we get every time and is one of my favorites. I got the deviled eggs for the first time and holy crap they were amazing. I'm gonna say  possibly the best ones I've ever had (sorry  Dad).   Everything about this restaurant leans towards comfort and it's always done so well. The atmosphere  the staff  the decor  the food  hell even the temperature. I've never had a bad experience at Jones and I don't think I ever will.   Next year....we'll just go straight to Jones.\"\n",
      "Four stars for a great little gem. I stopped in last minute before a show and was able to grab 2 seats at the bar.   The drinks were glorious  the bartenders were glorious  and I had a salad the size of a small infant.  It did seem to fill up fairly quickly  so I recommend a reservation and empty bellies.\n",
      "Food was really good  portions are big so we were able to share which brought the price down to a more reasonable amount.\n",
      "I've been here quite a few times now and the ambiance and food are great! It is a bit on the pricey side but their salads are worth it! They have a make your own salad list  where you can check any ingredients you want in your salad for a flat price of $15 and the portions are huge!   The service here is also great! Definitely recommend this place!\n",
      "The ambience and decor were nice. The nachos were good  along with a few choice options. However  do not order a cheeseburger. It is not only tiny  but it looks like something that was dropped off the back of a McDonald's truck as it was driving through a bad neighborhood. It was over cooked  dry  and just plain nasty. I was very disappointed to find such a flop in a restaurant that seems to be filled with blockbusters. The overall experience was fine  but that burger sure did ruin it.  The fries were another disappointment all their own.\n",
      "Service was fine (other than our dirty appetizer plates sitting stacked at the end of the table throughout our meal) - Had the mac and cheese appetizer arrived before we placed our order  we probably would have left - Mac and cheese had odd plastic-y taste - Crab cake was bland - seared tuna should have come on a smaller plate (three slices of tuna on top of rice on one side of a rectangular plate) - we ordered a chicken soup to go and had to throw it out when we arrived at our destination because the cardboard cover had popped off the hot cup - pear crisp was the best part - $4 cup of coffee was tepid  at best\n",
      "Double Knot was recommended by a bartender from Graffiti Bar and it did not disappoint. Food was great  ambiance was great and our waitress Caydie was knowledgeable  attentive and very helpful in helping us pick everything from Sake to our meals. Would absolutely recommend Double Knot and will be coming back for sure!\n",
      "This review is only for downstairs at Double Knot:  Three words - Cold  Dark and Salty. We've been here twice now and while the upstairs seating area is great for happy hour cocktails and small plates the formal dining area in the basement was pretty disappointing.  While the ambience is great for an intimate dinner/date night the space in itself is extremely cold both during the winter and summer.  Some of the dishes are a hit or miss and the overall quality has deteriorated ( this goes for Sampan as well). The Robotayaki dishes we ordered were either completely lacking in salt or drowning in it. The edamame dumplings are the only consistent dish we've had since frequenting the MJS chain.  We also ordered the roast fish for two which was lacking in flavor and just about average. Server knowledge of the restaurants was pretty poor- we were discussing the dessert menu at both restaurants and he told us that he was pretty sure that Sampan never had the mini soft serve cones!!  I gave this place 3 stars because the cocktails are pretty good  they do have some signature dishes that are worth the visit and the happy hour specials upstairs are great!\n",
      "My happy hour plan at Sampan fell through it was that crowded. Plan B is obviously Double Knot. They had a spot for me at the downstairs bar. I did not think this place could have anymore twists and turns but I was led through a door  down a long staircase  up a small flight of more steps pass a sushi bar and a busy kitchen and then down again into the mother of all nooks and crannies.  I was in some small dark secret crevice of the building. It was very dark. So dark I could barely read the small booklet I was given. The bar is small down there. I believe six seats. And yet there were three bartenders. One would have been sufficient but I found myself with my own personal man. I felt vey James Bond-ish.   Of course I could not get the kimchi fried rice that I wanted but my man had a pork bao bun special for me. He said it was new. It was tasty.  But the pork gyoza (dumplings) were my favorite with the scallion pancake fried on top. Very good. I might find my way back down there again. By the way order the monkey fist. The drinks are small for the price but it was damn good.\n",
      "\n",
      "This review is only for upstairs lunch.  It's simple. You go up to the bar  order  they give you a number  and the food comes out to you. It's only $7 (choose your protein for banh mi  cold noodles  hot rice  or salad)  a steal in center city! ...or not. I had the pork banh mi. There wasn't a lot of meat  and it wasn't very large  understandable because it's only $7. The roll was incredible  but the meat was quite dry.   I could see myself returning if I didn't eat very much or if the portions were larger  but for now  I won't be back. It was just okay. Maybe for dinner someday.\n",
      "I've had the pleasure of dinning here (restaurant downstairs) a handful of times  and must say the food has been consistently great! Go with the tasting menu if you can  to experience the full range of food they offer here- you won't be disappointed.\n",
      "I've only been once for dinner  but it was a great date night spot. The atmosphere sort of reminded me of a speakeasy dungeon  but in a good way on the dungeon part (if that's possible. Hey  look  just go with it). Very dark  candlelit  cavernous and yet intimate. We were seated downstairs  and the server was super helpful (although my date remarked his Japanese pronunciation was pretty awful--I wouldn't know). The food was delish  we ordered a few small items: sashimi  Japanese fried chicken  shishito peppers  and lots from the robatayaki menu. Okay  come to think of it  we chowed down pretty hard. It was all yum. I would definitely go again.\n",
      "I have friends who dine here quite frequently. After coming here with them  I am at a loss as to why they continue to return. The food was bland and the atmosphere was totally off - way too dark  tables were really cramped  waitstaff was not helpful. I was disappointed and will not return.\n",
      "Great \\speak-easy\\\" type of place where you put your name in at a hostess stand at the back of the street-level lounge area. When called  they take you down the stairs (the noise-level from upstairs disappears) and you enter an extremely classy  dimly-lit dining/bar area. The asian-fusion menu was very large and sure to please anyone (apps  skewers  sushi  etc). The best part is the great service and very knowledgeable staff who really put in 110% effort in serving you unique drinks and tasty food.  I think this is great for a date night or a small group of friends. the Double Know signature drink was amazing. It can get costly but I think it's very worth it for a nice night out.\"\n",

      "The one time I ate at Gran Caffe L'Aquila I was there for 3 hours. It's right next door to Nordstrom Rack and looks unassuming from the outside  but once you step inside and go upstairs you realize just how huge it is (great for large parties)! The menu is seriously extensive and mostly in Italian  which makes it a bit overwhelming  but the waiters are extremely knowledgable and more than willing to help out! I ordered the zuppa de pesce and the pear cranberry salad  which were both delicious  but the highlight of the meal was definitely dessert! They bring you a huge platter with every dessert available so you can take a look at everything before you order  and their gelato is award winning  so don't miss out on that!\n",
      "\n",
      "this place is beautiful!!! its so cute! a client of mine told me that they have the best gelato in the city and its a must try. Nutella  and banana gelato was orgasmic. go good. i tried it all and it was all so good. must try!!!\n",
      "It's always a great time here. On this occasion I did not eat  I just went for a few drinks and a lovely chat with a girlfriend.   She order an iced cappuccino that she said was lovely  and I had a lemon granita. The granita was quite sweet for my buds  but after squeezing actual lemon into it...it was perfect.  The staff is always friendly and attentive. They have a great selection of food  drinks  and Italian gelato!   From prior visits the salads are very good  I also had the gnocchi once with mushrooms! Truffle fries are yuk as well. This is definitely a great date night or just a good time with friends. Enjoy!!\n",
      "Loved it. The staff is really friendly  especially Matteo  our server. Things to get: the octopus and the Hillary Clinton beer and the cappuccino. Things to avoid: that mosaic sushi thing. The restaurant overall is great for a date or just a place to chill with a coffee. Dinner for two comes to about $50 because even though the individual dishes are cheap  you will want to try more than one and then they will add up pretty quickly.\n",
      "I'm so glad I accidentally stumbled upon this place on my way out of work yesterday. I don't think my life will ever be the same again.   As someone who grew up in Europe  I get a bit nostalgic at times  and I could not have been more excited to find out that a piece of Italy has made its way across the Atlantic Ocean and nestled itself on Chestnut Street between Sephora and the music store.   Entering this establishment  I was greeted by (a hostess  but also) a delicious looking assortment of gelato. I hear some flavors are spiked  which I'm really excited to try. If it weren't so cold outside  I would have been compelled to clean out this entire gelato section myself. However  since it was cold and I already had dinner  I decided to add a nice finish to my evening by sipping some hot  aromatic Italian coffee along with bites of their delicious pastries.   Though I wish I could have sampled everything  I only got to try the lavender panna cotta and white chocolate bread pudding. However  both were heavenly and well-balanced in both flavor and texture. You can be sure that I will be back to try every single item at this establishment - whether it is for breakfast  lunch  dinner  or a late night glass of wine. Very solid execution in product quality  concept  and service.\n",
      "Words cannot even begin to describe the amazing quality of the food made here.  From the appetizers to dessert as well as drinks  everything I have tried is house-made and quite amazing.  I commend it for its simple flavors that are well executed giving much respect to each ingredient.  It's flavorful yet not overdone in terms of complexity.  You'll understand when you try ANY of their dishes (I would highly recommend any of their gelato-paired pastas -  new yet exciting and delicious experience).  Desserts are beautifully done: lavender panna cotta  tiramisu  and not to mention the best gelato in town.  The ambiance is lovely with soft yet modern interior designs and meeting the needs of both dine-in customers as well as coffee enthusiasts.  Though service is subpar for what is expected from a restaurant this caliber  its special menu which features a city each week will make up for it.  It gives a chance to see the chefs represent a new flavor profile and better expose yourself to Italy.  So the next time you're in the area  take the chance to taste a bit of Italy and grab a panini  pasta  white peach sangria  or a chocolate mousse.\n",
      "I've only had espressos here but they are fantastic and can be ordered so many ways on the menu. Gelato here is good too  as are the interesting Italian desserts.\n",
      "Was once a big fan of the place and love the concept in general.  My most recent visit was unfortunately not great.  Kind of started at the host stand where I could barely get someone to look at me (busy cleaning menus) and when the hostess finally looked up  informed me that she couldn't seat me until my full table was present (at 9pm on a monday night with a total of 15 people in the restaurant and 400 open seats  this seemed a little odd).  When my friend finally arrived  the hostess asked us to wait at the bar while our table was prepared (again  400 open seats)...... once we were seated  experience was also just ok.  Space is still beautiful  but seemed a little tired (maybe it was just the staff at the tail end of a slow night that made it feel that way).  The food was ok (calamari was a little smaller serving than I remembered and a little dry)  beef carpaccio was good  Caesar salad just ok- they were out of the Crab Cake which was really too bad as I was looking forward to it.   We shared the Rib eye and it was well prepared.  Having another server cleaning and moving tables right next to us for a sustained period while we ate was a bit distracting  but not the end of the world (again  my fault for going so late).   They were also out of the corn side dish which I remember being delicious so I was again  disappointed.   I can't help but feel like a place of this level and price gets less leeway when it comes to being properly stocked up  i.e.  don't run out of stuff.  Finally  and this is a personal thing- the crowd was not what I remembered.  Again  there weren't many  but the customers there were very sloppy looking and very poorly dressed.  I remember the crowd was at one time  very attractive and very sharp.  Overall  kind of a disappointing experience.\n",
      "Nice all around place for dinner  appetizers and or drinks.\n",
      "Always a great dining experience! From the food to the atmosphere  we never leave disappointed! Will certainly be back soon.\n",
      "I recently went to Del Frisco's for a special treat night out. I live pretty close to the restaurant  but had never been there.  The Good: * It's a beautiful restaurant. Although  we ate in \\the vault\\\" which is in the basement and lacked the grandness of the upstairs. If I was to go again  I'd request not to be in the vault.  * The tables were far enough apart that you could have intimate conversation. * The food was good. I really thought it would be SHOCKINGLY good... but it was just good. I had an 8oz filet... The other good thing about the food is the sides are family style. So even though your \\\"meal\\\" is just a piece of steak  the sides feed at least two. * I had a champagne cocktail which was AWESOME. The Bad: * The service wasn't great. From the coat check lady not being in the coat check room  the hostess asking my name THREE times (we had a reservation)  and finally our server... I just have a higher expectation of service at such an expensive place. Our server was nice enough  but didn't really talk to us  and stood chatting with another server for at least 5 minutes holding my friend's glass of wine before she brought it over. (We were already eating.) * On our way out  we both commented on how um  mature everyone was. It's certainly not a trendy crowd... maybe rich middle-aged rittenhouse people?  * For two people  who both got small steaks  two sides and two drinks our meal was $140 without tip. If it was AWESOME  I wouldn't have blinked... but I remain underwhelmed.  If anything  I'd probably go back for a casual happy hour type thing  but I don't think I'll be having another meal here.\"\n",
      "Great food and a great space.  Food: I went here during restaurant week with friends and got the Fillet.  It was cooked perfectly and was juicy.  I couldn't ask for anything more.  The bar area is pretty spacious and good for a quick drink while waiting for a table.  Service: Friendly and knowledgeable.    Ambiance: The restaurant is in what used to be a bank.  It's really beautiful.  They have an old vault that you can eat in.  I thought that that was interesting.\n",
      "I have to start off by saying the VIP is to die for!  Portions here are so large that it was overwhelming for me (but I'm not a big eater).  I tend to choose apps over entrees for my meal and the apps here are amazing.  The Tuna tare tare was out of this world and I'm a sucker for a great salad (I know  so boring).  The filet was one of the best I ever tasted and the lobster mac and cheese  which was so rich and filling  was wonderful.  I could only taste a bite or two because it was just so rich.    The service was just okay--not sure if we were there on a bad night or if that is the standard but we definitely where left waiting for a long period of time to order drinks  receive our check and have our food packed to go.  Not a big deal because I don't like to rush a nice dinner but I do like to enjoy a cocktail while I wait.\n",
      "Some of the best steak I have ever had. This place is huge and very classy. Perfect for a special date night. Also has a more casual bar scene to watch the game. You are going to pay here  but the experience is worth it. Dinner in the basement vault is the sexiest thing to do here.\n",
      "Overall great experience and love at first sight  great ambience and decor! Filet steak and bone in steak is made to perfection and price is expensive but for the quality of food that was served it was good  vip cocktail was really good  house salad was delish with avocado ranch dressing with three thick pieces of bacon  and lastly lobster mac and cheese is a must when you go here! Will definitely come back for more!\n",
      "This place is awesome! Everything is good. The atmosphere is awesome. Service is always great. My go to place in Philly. I enjoy eating downstairs near the old bank vaults  sitting at the bar chatting with the bartenders and sitting upstairs overlooking the main dinning floor. My fav restaurant in the city  hands down.\n",
      "I don't think I have ever experience worse service at a white-tablecloth restaurant before.  I arrived at about 5:40pm on Thursday. The waitress came right over and took my order  a cocktail and a hamburger (I was with a group of people for happy hour).  The cocktail came right away.  An hour later  i was still waiting for the hamburger.  The sad thing is  in that time  3 other people joined my table (at least 30 minutes after I arrived) and ordered food.  The *same* waitress took their order and delivered their food well before mine (two of them ordering the hamburger)  without giving it a second though.  When I inquired where my food was  first I was told \\it is coming off the grill\\\"  then about 10 minutes later I was told  \\\"it just went on the grill\\\".  When my food finally arrived  it was cold and raw.  The waitress  for some reason  didn't comprehend that I had been waiting for an hour and only offered half-hearted apologies.  To add insult to injury  I was charged for the cold and raw hamburger that was served an hour later.  My table's bill was well over $300.  To make matters worse  when a friend and me when to get our coats from the coat check room  it took them 20 minutes to find our coats (we had both been given claim check tickets with numbers on them).  The coat check people were able to find other people's coats who came 15 minutes after us  even after the coat check people asked us numerous times to describe our coats (mind you  my friend is 6'4\\\").  After 20 minutes  we were invited into the coat check room to find our own coats!!  As soon as I walked in  my coat was staring me in the face  not 2 feet away.  My 6'4\\\" friend found his right away.  I am embarrassed to say that I have recommended Del Frisco's to others.  Unless the management cleans house  I will never go there ever again.  I could have gone across the street and got a hamburger from Wendy's that tasted better  cost less  and took 55 minutes less time to make.\"\n",
      "My girlfriend and I came here for dinner  and it was excellent. We each had our own individual hotpots  tomato oxtail soup and the original soup -- very good. We order they're beef combo  which included the waygu beef they're known for  and grabbed items on the conveyer belt rotating around the restaurant. My girlfriend loved rainbow noodles and rainbow soup dumplings. Our server Brandon was excellent  attentive  made sure our pots were refilled.\n",
      "We recently tried Chubby Cattle on a whim. Read an article and wanted to go! Not insanely priced  but not cheap either. My boyfriend and I always \\over\\\" order so we asked our server Stephen to help us out. Though he was knowledgeable of the menu and super personable  we still did not get a sense of how much or what to order - so we just went for it. The menu is also confusing  different ounces for various meats  no suggestions on party size vs. ordering  apps also on the last page - just odd! We were 100% happy with the food thought but I just wish they had explained the entire process more when we sat down. It's an experience that you want to experience  not fumble through.   I also thought the service needed some work. Though Stephen  and what seemed to be the manager  were attentive  we were the ones asking them to clear our table and grab water  etc. Again  fumbling through an already hands-on dining experience  that has MANY dishes (ha).  Since we're already cooking  and as customers  we should not also be doing everything else. I think these tiny details will come with time.   I'll go back but I need to wait until they've had a little more experience and firm up their process. And maybe in a large group!\"\n",
      "Great new hot pot place in Chinatown! They have a great waiting system that calls text you when a table is available. There are many types of soup bases to choose from and plenty of dishes. All of them were really delicious. My favorite was the mushroom combo basket. Simin  our waitress was really kind and helpful. Thanks Chubby Cattle!\n",
      "Very tasty  I like the original soup and meat  beef and lamb. Food on the belt is just ok  but the service is very good!\n",
      "I came here with three of my friends. Waited 20 minutes on a Tuesday night at 6:30pm.  I think people like this place for the Instagram pictures. They display their food very nicely  but it is over priced hot pot food. We ordered the wagu yukke and to us it tasted like nothing but sweet soy sauce. The noodles make a good picture  but it tasted ordinary. We ordered a beef combo which tasted like hot pot beef. Out of the different soup bases we tried  the best one was the tomato ox tail flavor. Overall  the food was average to the four of us.\n",
      "As an Asian who lived in japan for a while  I think this restaurant is overpriced and overrated. Great service with expensive (but not delicious)food. The experience is unique if you have never been to the cheap sushi house in Asia (picture attached).\n",
      "I'm going to start off by saying sorry to Little Sheep  because it looks like I have a new hotpot spot in Philly. Everything was great  the staff  the food and the decor.   I decided to go give it a try here with my girlfriend and mom. Boyyy was it a good decision. We got the A5 wagyu  wagyu brisket  and all other stuff and the broth base was so good. Definitely coming back\n",
      "I can definitely walk away from here feeling like a chubby cattle. This place has amazing tasting broth with excellent quality meats.   Upon walking in  you are greeted right away. If there is a wait  they will let you know apx how long and if you would like to wait to fill out their screen with info so they could text and call you when you are up. This is a great concept as you can go elsewhere and grab a drink or tour Ctown as you are waiting for a table.  Once seated  the server comes by and gives you a tour of the menu and of the different type of cuts they carry. They have about 5 different broths to chose from and tons of veggies  noodles  and meats. They also have a conveyor belt of items that you can just grab from (charged based on color of the plate).  We decided to try the oxtail broth and the miso one. My kids loved the miso while my husband and I really enjoyed the oxtail. Since the kids wanted miso  we added chili peppers into ours to give it a nice kick. They bring out a tray of condiments and their specialty sauce so you can add whatever you like to your broth and sauce to fit your liking. We made sure to add in extra cilantro and some garlic to both broth and house sauce. One thing I enjoyed in regards to the broth is that they actually refill your pot with the actual broth you ordered instead of a standard veggie or chicken broth like most places.   Since we were unsure of which cut of meat to get  we decided to try the sampler. Favorite off of this was definitely the wagu. Next time we come  that's probably what we will mostly be ordering. It was so buttery and melt in your mouth delicious.  We were seated at a table that didn't have a family sharing pot  so that was a bit difficult. They stated that they normally save those tables for larger parties of 6 or more. We didn't use 2 of the stove tops  so I do recommend them getting something to cover it so it could be used as extra table space. The table was a tad cramped  but it didn't stop us from enjoying our time there.  I can't wait to come back and actually try some of their other specialties.\n",

      "The family put is delicious & fun. I would highly recommend.  The tomato & oxtail broth is a must\n",
      "We are visiting in Philadelphia from California.  My son took us here for our 28 year wedding anniversary. All the food was delicious and the service was great! Everyone that worked there seemed happy to be there and we're extremely friendly! The pita bread was baked to order and served directly from the oven to the table and was by far  the best I'd had. The hummus  tabbouleh and marinated veggies were all Amazing! The grilled mixed mushrooms and lamb sausage were so flavorful! We didn't have anything that wasn't delicious! If I ever come back to Philly   I would definitely go back to this place! SO GOOD!!\n",
      "Delicious food ! I personally loved it !!!  I was surprised to see 3-star  reviews here but when I read it I understood the reason . Everyone loved the place  the food but the prices. Let me tell you something. If I don't want to spend $200 for dinner I don't go to Barkley Prime! If I want to get a good quality lunch I don't expect it to be less than $25. Unfortunately life is expensive here in Philadelphia  especially for people with good tastes.  And yes you have to pay $$$ for a good quality meals. So If you are aware of that I'm sure you will totally enjoy SURAYA\n",
      "Beautiful place. Excellent food. I only gave it a 2 because they gouge you on the drinks. My manhattan was $16. A very small glass of house wine was $11.50. There is no justification for that. We eat out often in good restaurants. This is the only place that gouges you on the drinks. I got the halibut. It was delicious but quite small with nothing on the side.\n",
      "It's extremely overpriced  and the sandwiches are a joke. I love Mediterranean cuisine but this is one of the worst i had. In a city with so many places to eat  i'd expect they would try harder.  Service is excellent  though. And the place is really nice\n",
      "Instagram worthy and Claire is an amazing server!   Suraya is super beautiful guys. Nice open space  ceramic tiles  and orange infused water. You enter straight into their bakery/cafe where you can order and sit or you can walk past a little and be seated in their restaurant. I recommend making a reservation because it can get pretty crowded. After a 10 min wait my party of 4 were seated straight away. Their booths are super comfy and bouncy!   Claire came to us shortly after and was super knowledgeable about the menu and helped us navigate for one of our party members who has an allergy. I started with the chai tea latte- so delicious. Then got a kefta platter. Once the food came out I realized it was the kefta sandwich but Claire and the manager figured everything out straight away and fixed my order (thanks guys!). The kefta was super moist  the hummus was A1 and their fries were seasoned to the max. Though I think their tabouli could have more lemon- just my preference though. Afterwards I finished with a rose and pistachio cruller which was so light and airy. Y'all gotta try it.   If visiting philly again I would definitely come back to Suraya.\n",
      "Great food ! Great customer service ! Amazing coffee!!! Great for business meeting   brunch with friends   romantic dinner and breakfast with a big family alike .  Very spacious   clean and welcoming !\n",
      "This is definitely the best breakfast place in Philly. İf you bored for classic breakfast routine you should definitely come and visit this place for unique taste super fast service  delicious coffee and friendly environment. Highly recommend it for this place for breakfast lunch or brunch. It's not like a regular classic American breakfast. It's a little expensive but it's worth every penny. Come on in and enjoy middle eastern hospitality.\n",

      "The space is gorgeous. I can't wait until it warms up and we can hang out in the courtyard. Beautiful moorish design throughout. We had the man'oushe with za'atar and cheese which was one of the staff's favorite as well. They are about 10\\ so enough for one person. It was full of flavor and very filling. I was satisfied with just this and a chai latte. It was pricy. 2 man'oushes and 2 coffees ran us $30. Unfortunately it's too expensive to frequent regularly  but we will definitely be back for a special treat. I can't wait to try their dinner service when it begins  and definitely  want to go back for the pastries!\"\n",
      "i had high expectations of suraya  and i'm happy to report that they were met. we were able to find a reservation on short notice  and were seating within ten minutes of arriving. the ambiance is lovely  with dim lighting and sections that look like tents in the desert.   the menu was divided into small plates & larger plates to share. we got the fattouch salad  crispy potatoes  and the fatteh. everything was delicious  but the fatteh provided a flavor profile unlike anything i've tried before. it. was. delicious.   we also had two different kinds of lamb  and topped off the evening with espresso. the bill came out to about $100--not bad for a celebratory dinner at a brand new restaurant. the service was great--attentive  but not *too* attentive. i'm a big fan of suraya  and i'll definitely return!\n",
      "Absolutely wonderful food & service! Go there for lunch dinner with my boyfriend at least once every two weeks. Prices are very much reasonable. Weekends get pretty packed so may have to wait a little bit but that's never an issue for us. Always get the Indian Pancake & the Hainanese Chicken or Curry Chicken. Other dishes are delicious as well. Never get tired of it!\n",
      "I've been coming to this place for years now  and even though I now live in Colorado  I come back here every time I'm in Philadelphia for work (which is often). I've tried many items on the menu and many were great  portions are generous  and prices are low. My go to item - Indian Mee Goreng  I can eat that every day of the week if I could  it's that good. Maybe one day I can get the recipe from the manager so I can actually do that on days I'm in CO.\n",
      "I always walk pass this place but decided to finally give it a try because of the reviews and the price. Overall  as someone already stated they have great apps but the entrees are left to be desired. Considering each entree costs ~$8  you get what you pay for. I ordered the Pad Thai and it was bad. Way too sweet with no spicy kick to it. We also ordered the Seafood Crispy Noodles  Pearl Noodles  and a Beef rice dish. All were really mediocre. The Indian pancakes and chicken satay apps were great though. Idk why the entrees were so lackluster. I'm sad I didn't enjoy it more but I'm glad the total was cheap for a night out.\n",
      "The Penang chicken with the chicken flavor infused white rice will always be one of my favorite meals. Wether in Boston or in Philly  the quality is the same and I am a huge fan. When we came in the line was very long but surprisingly we were sat in about 15-20 minutes. The service was fast from start to finish so I didn't have to wait long before I could start eating the juicy amazing chicken. I was planning on getting an order to go to drive back to Virginia to eat but that seemed greedy so I didn't. I regretted that decision the second I got back home so next time  I will be greedy!\n",
      "Malaysian cuisine isn't something I'm very experienced in.  Nice  clean atmosphere with good service and what's here isn't bad at all.  A little too strongly salted for my tastes  but perhaps that's just the way it is?  Way too much sodium for me  but perhaps I can ask them to go light on the salt next time.  The oyster omelet was a little too greasy as well.  Extensive menu and vegetarian friendly.  Everyone can probably find something they like here.\n",
      "Never had Malaysian food before eating here  but it's extremely good.  Roti canai was an excellent appetizer  almost better than the breads at dedicated Indian restaurants.  The noodle dishes are also delicious.  Atmosphere was great  I'll be back soon.\n",
      "I once had an allergic reaction to stealthy hidden carrots when I told the waiter that I didn't want carrots in my food.  Other than that  it was yummy  but I think that the food really doesn't match the atmosphere and decoration of the place.\n",
      "Food is so-so for specializing in Malaysian cuisine.  Service can be rude at times... if you really want Malaysian food try Banana Leaf around the corner and save yourself the agony of tipping on poor service.\n",
      "One of best Thai  Malaysian   Chinese food in Philadelphia . Ecnomical  fresh  nice service  quick and efficient staff . Trendy  you would see a lot of hippy crowd  sometimes gets noisy- nice hosts  better staff- English is a little bit issue with the staff-   It's in the heart of Philly ( Chinatown ).   Been here many times  I recommend it. Try their tea at the beginning which is free of charge.  Update : 6/17/2017. Staff was pushy  came thrice if we are done with the food- they just want you to leave as soon as possible. May be this is common in Chinatown -\n",
      "Excellent Malaysian Chinese cuisine. All entrees were excellent and served piping hot. Servers were very friendly and highly efficient. My wife and I had just visited the real Penang in Malaysia and this restaurant serves authentic dishes of the same quality.   Especially recommend the roti pancakes and the various noodle dishes. Best of all  prices are very reasonable for such a great meal.\n",
      "We went for my husbands birthday in a fairly large group. The service and food were all outstanding. We all had a great time and enjoyed a variety of apps  drinks and entrees.. Everyone left stuffed and happy. We will be back! Thanks for making our celebration a memorable night.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a fabulous restaurant (with a terrible name...gotta say I judged them for that at first). This place does true Indian fusion and pulls it off well! With a group of four  we ordered 3-4 small plates  2 half-sized vegetarian entrees and one full sized meat entree. While the portions looked small (we literally laughed when they brought out our very tasty half portion of squash)  we all left feeling full and happy. Some highlights were the spinach chaat (amazing! crispy!) and the naan pizza. Great cocktails too.   The food is better than Bindi and its less pretentious and more interesting than Tashan. Seriously. A new favorite in midtown village.\n",
      "Just tried to eat here but it's restaurant week only. Also  one of the first places I've been where they didn't accommodate my request to sit beside my husband. This place had really good ratings and decor but alas  off to Cuba Libre instead.\n",
      "I had the pleasure of sampling the life changing \\Drums of Heaven\\\"  at the Midtown Village Festival and it was love at first bite.  A friend & I made a reservation (which I STRONGLY suggest doing) for a Saturday evening and we were seated immediately. The place is beautiful  candlelit tables  great service and knowledgeable servers a very intimate setting (yes by intimate I do mean small).   The food  seemingly looks like it wouldn't be filling (clearly I was an Indian food virgin)  I had the Seafood Moilee (I may have spelled that incorrectly) along with the drums of Heaven and everything was perfect  the food came out in a timely manner  no complaints about that whatsoever. The only thing I'd suggest is to request to be seated near the wall  as we were seated in the center and constantly had to deal with being bumped by bussers  waiters & waitresses and passersby.\"\n",
      "We went here for the restaurant week and sampled the fixed course. I was not happy about the lack of vegetarian entrees on the restaurant week menu. [Yes I could have ordered the main menu but I wanted to sample the 'specials']   The food was pretty damn good  it did exceed my expectations but it wasn't the most authentic. After going up and down the coast and sampling the Indian restaurants I appreciate good stuff but I still can never find many places with the authentic taste.   The restaurant is a bit tight with space but is tastefully decorated. It is definitely expensive and not your weekend takeout staple.\n",
      "Amazing Crispy spinach chaat was so good! I could of ordered  a second had another glass of wine and been satisfied. However we ordered more and everything was amazing! Paneer masala lamb and the special seafood dish!! I can wait to go back. Our waitress was wonderful  making perfect suggestion!\n",
      "Checked in on 8/1/2016.  They have express lunch specials in which you can choose one savory snack and one entree.  We ordered 2 of these deals:  1) Crispy Spinach Chaat and Lollipop Lamb Chops:  The chaat and lamb chops were excellent.  The spinach was crispy and the sauce coating the spinach was a perfect balance of tangy and sweet.  The lamb was soft and had nice marination.  I am biased towards Lamb sourced from New Zealand and when I see those magic words on the menu card of a restaurant  I can't help but order the dish.  The only complaint with lamb chops was that they were smaller than I've eaten in other comparable restaurants.  Now  I also have to add that price at IndeBlue for this dish was lower than the other restaurants.  So  I guess  you pay less and you get less.    2) Drums of heaven and Malai Kofta Bukhara:  Drums of heaven were cooked perfectly and were big in size.  I would have liked them more if they were spicier and not so sweet.  Malai Kofta was excellent.  The gravy had lot of flavor  the koftas were soft and tasty.  I would rate the food 4.75/5.  Service was exactly what I expect when I eat out.  The timing between the courses was perfect  the temperature of the food was hot when served  the plating of the food was good  the utensils were clean  the hostess was polite  the server asked if we were done before removing the empty plates.  Everything was perfect.  Service was 5/5.  Summary:  IndeBlue is a beautifully decorated restaurant  in downtown Philly  that serves tasty Indian cuisine with high service standards.\n",
      "So good!  Excellent  high quality Indian Food.  The best naan I have ever had  which is a bold statement!\n",
      "What a great find  my bae took me here for my birthday. It's a great spot  we really liked the decor and dim lighting  a perfect spot for a date night or a dinner night with family.   We tried their multi course meal and we were blown away by the food and service. We tried -  1) Crab Dosa and Fish Tacos for Apps 2) Shrimp Curry and Panner Masala  with assorted naans as entrees 3) Kulfi  Chocolate Mousse with tea as the last course  We really liked the flavor profile of our food  everything was really good but Crab dosa was my favorite  though we were hesitant to try dosa with seafood filing but it turned out to be really delicious.Our server was super nice and the service was extremely good.   Thank you  IndeBlue for making my birthday special.\n",
      "Came Saturday w/ friends at 11:30am. Half off happy hour top shelf liqueur. Had the best Bloody Mary EVER.  The crab cake omelet was outstanding I went without the hollandaise sauce not necessary if you want to taste the sweetness of the crab  fluffy eggs and fresh vegetables. I was surprised at the size of the potions and the amount of crab and vegetables in my omelet excellent value for the money.    Salads looked wonderful and the French toast smelled amazing. Wonderful tea selections and good coffee.  Come hungry\n",
      "Tip: Happy hour is until 7 on weekdays. 1/2 price beer  wine  and cocktails.  Now on the my review. I've been to Farmicia many times in the past. I really enjoy taking friends here because they have vegan and meat items on the menu. Something for both os us! Farmicia is BYOB  which is a huge plus. The restaurant is clean and I enjoy the atmosphere.   Being vegan  I like having some menu items dedicated to me. I'd like a few more options  but I think what they have is solid. There is usually a vegan soup to choose from and some menu items can be made vegan upon request. I've always had good service at Farmicia. The staff is friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend Farmicia.\n",
      "Went for Restaurant Week and we were pleasantly surprised! We like to try places we've never been for RW which makes me nervous  but it was very tasty. Hubby had the meatballs  pork  and sorbet  and he really enjoyed it all. I had the crab meat salad with the avocado and pears and it was delicious! So much crab meat and the pears gave it a nice fresh  sweet bite. My entree was the chicken  which I don't usually order in restaurants because it's not very exciting. But I asked the waiter and he recommended it over the fish I was considering. It was moist and had a lot of flavor. Creme brûlée for dessert was good as well  but that's hard to mess up. We look forward to trying Farmicia for brunch next time!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We came here for Sunday brunch around 1 and we didn't have to wait at all  we were seated right away. The service was great and food was above average. I just didn't think it's outstanding compare to other chicken and waffles I had prior to this. My one friend got salmon Benedict which I tried and it is pretty good. However  I really didn't like the quantity of the food  it's considered small and none of them come with any sides.\n",
      "Farmicia worked out well for Sunday brunch with a group of seven  who all enjoyed their meals. I was very happy with the shrimp-and-grits entree. The shrimp was plump  firm  and full-flavored. The grits were decadently creamy but not excessively so  and the bits of crispy bacon made the meal seem very luxurious.  I've been to Farmicia a few times over the years  and found it to be somewhat hit or miss. In this case  however  I enjoyed a very fine meal.  Even with the restaurant being packed  the food came out reasonably fast and our server was present and attentive. The acoustics in the restaurant are very good--we were able to hear one another speak  even from across the table  without shouting. I appreciate this in a place  especially when you are with a large group.\n",
      "All I can say is yum! Delicious and inspiriting food for vegetarians and meat lovers alike. Beautifully plated  thoughtful dishes that look as wonderful as they taste. Warm atmosphere and attentive service. Definitely a not to miss spot!\n",
      "Went for dinner.  Environment was nice with a bit of welcome space between us and other guests.  The hostess and servers were pleasant  our waiter not so much.  The flavors in all entrees were very good  but suffered from being precooked and served warm instead of hot.  Skip dessert  there are better options in Center City.\n",
      "Farmicia has hands-down the best brunch I've ever had. I've been twice so far and can't wait to go back again. They have a \\happy hour\\\" during brunch where you can get any specialty drink for $5. My favorite is the Farmhouse Sangria. For food  the lump crab omelette is amazing. You can really taste the \\\"farm fresh\\\" quality in everything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Solid place  nothing wrong with it. But going here is never my idea. The food is just alright  slightly over priced  decent atmosphere\n",
      "It's a nice restaurant with a nice modern decor. Sushi was fresh and the service was great. They have a lot of fancy special rolls (which we ordered their 4 new ones)  and more of the traditional ones too. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a cool sushi place. If you're looking for good sushi  nice environment  and good drinks for a great value  check out Fat Salmon.\n",
      "I stopped in for a light lunch. I was pleasantly surprised by the amazing ambiance and fresh sushi! The service was prompt-- necessary for a workweek lunch. I ordered two rolls and a salad for $14! This is much less than what some chains charge. I will certainly mark this as a top sushi restaurant in Center City  Philadelphia!\n",
      "This is in my opinion the best sushi place in Center City. I do not get specialty rolls when I get sushi because they are usually expensive and not really worth it BUT here there are so good. There are so many unique sushi rolls and flavor that you can't really find anywhere else. All the sushi is fresh and the rice fish ratio is great. Bonus: they let our party stay way past 11 PM (their closing time) while we finished our wine bottle and conversation. Also  our waitress was great: quick service  packed up all our leftovers for us  and gave us extra sauces free of charge. Overall  great food and awesome ambiance.\n",
      "I love fat salmon   really intimate and cute set up although a little cramped feeling. Delicious sushi and has something for everyone as I went on two occasions with two picky eaters and they both found something they enjoyed. My faves are the Dragonfly and Rolling Fire so good! The service is usually spot on but my last visit we were rushed during our meal despite coming in almost two hours before closing and ppl were sat after us and not bothered once- still comes back cause it's great that just was an weird night for me. Oh it can be packed most nights but they seat you as quickly as possible.\n",
      "My favorite sushi place in Philly. A bit off the path and usually not too crowded  but still at a nice restaurant standard. Service is generally attentive and my usual order of locust and blossom rolls are my favorite sushi dishes in Philly.\n",
      "Had an excellent dinner here...  actually impressed by the freshness of the food!  Sushi in Philadelphia has been having a tough time in the past year  but this place puts it back on the map.  Delicious  original  and I love the style.   The presentation is clean and appealing as well  and they keep the restaurant very clean..  It's a fairly new place and still growing  but I have no doubt it will stand apart if they keep raising the bar like they are.\n",
      "I had good memories of coming to fat salmon a few years back so coming back had been on my radar for some time now. We got reservations for Saturday night dinner. Reservations fill fast so make sure you try atleast a day in advance. The place was full when we arrived. There were people waiting and because it's a small shoebox style place  it looked pretty cramped up.   We started with sake samplers and ordered a few rolls. Service was average on that day. Sushi was as usual fresh and nice. Sake was refreshing. Prices are reasonable. The place is very popular for delivery too. We saw plenty of uber eats/ yelp eats delivery guys come over in the 1 hour we spent there.\n",
      "I went here with a group of friends just as a girl's night. We all decided we wanted sushi and heard good things about Fat Salmon. Reserved a table for 4 through Yelp's SeatMe feature...super easy! A friend and I split the \\Sushi for 2\\\" which was plenty of food for two people and included soup and salad. The Spicy Tuna roll was great! Our friends each got 2 specialty rolls  and while I can't remember which ones  they both said they were delicious. To finish  I got green tea ice cream which was very good and came in a large portion  and my friend got the tempura ice cream which was a HUGE portion! But it was so yummy so that was ok:) Overall  a great place  with good service.\"\n",
      "Good food  reasonably priced  and nice staff. Not ideal for eating in  but since they are going for a fast food approach to vegan food  that makes a lot of sense. I know the buffalo bella is the dish that they push the hardest  but for my money the Cheesesteak is the way to go. And pro-tip: Get the sweet potato fries.\n",
      "Super lunch option Watch out for the yoga mats You won't miss the meat  Lunch has been very strange for me since HipCity opened. Because here's the thing: I am a meat eater. I mean like my last meal on earth would be a burger. Or  just maybe  the fajita wrap. Because it's that good.  Haven't had everything on the menu yet  but everything I have had has been great. The buffalo bella and crispy hipcity ranch are amazing sandwich alternatives  especially paired with the green lemonade. The groothie is also delicious  and can stand on its own to get you through an afternoon if you only want to spend a few bucks.  Okay suffice it to say that the food is great. The staff is also very friendly  and when they get busy someone will come out along the line and take orders so congestion doesn't get too bad at the register itself.  My only issue with HipCity is that it is at times nearly impossible to figure out where to stand when you're waiting to order or waiting for your food. People kind of convene everywhere and it can get awkward when there's a line out the door. In such a small space it's hard to rectify  but if I see a line out the door I tend to walk on by not because it's a long wait (they're really efficient)  it's just difficult to navigate the interior.\n",
      "Wow. I am not a vegetarian  nor am I a health-food nut (except for my random \\diet\\\" binges) but this place is awesome. A co-worker talked me into trying it out one day (by going there and getting me something and putting it in front of me) and she created a monster. I may not order every day but I sure do think about them. And their delicious salads! Every time I go there I am greeted with a smile and there are tons of other people waiting for their food  as well. Good company =)\"\n",
      "Great location  great food  and friendly staff! There are only a few seats and the store gets pretty crowded with people waiting for their food. I saw a lot of online order ready to go at the counter and think that would be the smart move the next time I want to come during a weekday lunch rush. Weather permitting  it's great to grab some HCV and eat it in Rittenhouse Square across the street! I've come a few times with friends and coworkers and no one has complained about their choices (vegetarians and meat eaters alike)!\n",
      "I like this place.  Unique sandwiches  and it's definitely the best place to go if you want a healthy option or have vegan friends.\n",
      "You honestly can't go wrong here. My favorites are the Udon Noodle Salad (a-ma-zing) and the Crispy Hipcity Ranch (so  so good). Friendly staff  fast service. Oh  they deliver too!\n",
      "I know people RAVE about this place  but frankly I find it A-OK.   It is a great location  the food is fresh  and they have a great variety of vegan options. But I find it pretty blah otherwise. I've had the crispy ranch and the curry tofu and enjoyed both of them  but I feel like I expect more out of a specialty vegan place. I did really like chick'n in the crispy ranch. The fries are pretty good too. My green lemonade was way too sweet and lemonade-y for me.   If I were you  I would try it because people love it so much and you get some unique items. But for the $10 range for a lunch item  I wouldn't  say it's nothing AMAZING.\n",
      "Magical vegan heaven. My wife and I stopped here on a detour from our route back home to Boston and she (a non-vegan) devoured their Philly steak. I literally had to pry her away from ordering more  I don't blame her at all though because the food was damn good. I had the curry tofu wrap and it was delicious. The place is pretty small with limited seating so a lot of people were taking (and I'm assuming regularly take) their food to go  so I'd be wary of this if you're wanting to sit in.   But yeah this place rocks. Their kale lemonade alone is worth the 5 stars. Next time we're in Philly this place will be among the first in which we stuff our faces.\n",
      "Had a vegan chicken burger and it was delicious! Tasty with good spices. Small space inside and a bit crowded when you are waiting for the food. But no long wait  exceptionally fast and this was during lunchtime. Perfect if you order food to go.\n",
      "Despite being a staunch meat-eater  I can say without question this place rocks! My brother and a friend (both vegans) also enjoy this place. So  it's safe to say that this is a great spot to get food in general -- whether you're a vegan or otherwise!\n",
      "\n",
      "Seating was horrible: We came in without a reservation into a half full restaurant and were tried to seated three times: 1st direct at the exit  2nd into the beetle and 3rd at the bar. The waitress promised us that she'll seat us to an appropiate table on the 2nd floor within 20-30 minutes. After one hour we ordered some nachos at the bar which came fast and were delicious. We've never seen the waitress again during 2 hours although about 10 or 12 tables around us weren't occupied.\n",
      "I had heard great things about Distrito so I was dying to go!  Overall I had a great time.  I was kind of disappointed that we went during dining days because we were only allowed to order off of that menu  which was fine  but there were other dishes that I had wanted to try and they were not available.  For the first course we had gauc  shrimp ceviche  and a tostada.  The tostada was just alright but the gauc was good as well as the ceviche!  I was hesitant to try a shrimp ceviche but the flavor was awesome!  Then for our second  course we had mahi tacos  the mushroom flatbread  and the scallops.  I was extremely disappointed in the scallops.  They were not that flavorful at all.  The tacos were awesome and the flatbread was amazing because I am a sucker for any truffle and mushroom combination.  For drinks we had a watermelon marg as well as a pineapple and a glass of red sangria.  I would not reccommed the sangria.  The watermelon marg was awesome but the pineapple one was amazinggg!!  I am a hardcore margarita fan and I am also extremely picky.  They were perfectly light and refreshing without being too sweet.  I hate sweet things or anything fake.  To end we both had the chocolate dessert which was so yummy.  I would love to go back again and try more off of the regular menu.  All of the staff were very nice as well.  Service was good not great but we had an awesomeee time!!\n",
      "To be honest  I expected very little from this place and was completely put off by the gaudy decor  but the food made up for it all.  They had some very interesting dishes  but still stuck to the tradition in a lot of ways.  The margaritas are really good  but not the best I've ever had (try whatever marg flavor they have for the day - the fruit flavors are delicious!). I really enjoyed the yellowtail tacos and tuna ceviche and my friend ordered the \\District Chicken\\\"  which smelled oustanding. The meat was juicy with a crispy spicy sauce on the outside. The yuca fries were really crispy and more starchy in the middle than the one's I've had at other places. All in all - defintely a great find! I wish my stomach was bigger so I could try more :-/  The service was good  the place is gigantic (great for a birthday dinner!) and the location is fairly convenient for U.City kids. Prices are a bit high  but you're paying for atmosphere  quality and the portion size (which is generous).  Note - I didn't get to try it  but the chips and guac on the table next to us looked good and I remember hearing \\\"mmm's\\\" coming from their table.\"\n",
      "I would really love to say that I liked this place  but I can't.  There is no question that the decor is sweet.  We sat in a huge wrap around wicker booth which was super cute  but am I here for the seating or the food?  We were a party of 5 and had the tasting menu  but I felt like it was the tasting menu for 2.  When someone pays over $300.00 for a meal  I feel like you should get more than a tiny bite of something. One tiny flat bread for 5 people...come on!  All that being said  the coffee is to die for...the end!\n",
      "Got a chance to finally try Distrito as a part of the University City Dining Days.  With a 7:30 reservation in hand for a Sunday night we were ready to go.    The Great:  All of our food was flavorful and the portions were a perfect size.  I left dinner full but not disgustingly full.  Some highlights for me were the esquites  the guacamole (I love guac with big chunks)  the fried plantains  and the chicken tacos.  The A-OK:  Had a 7:30 reservation and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table  which is fine but the restaurant did not look that busy.  The service was also disjointed at times  entrees came out while we were still working on apps  one of our entrees came out way before the rest.    Overall a great meal  great ambience in the restaurant.  The shortcomings on the service end make me err away from a higher rating.\n",
      "Sorry but I think this place suffers from University City grade inflation.  While the idea of Mexican \\tapas\\\" is novel  it's not my idea of proper Mexican food.  The portions were small  expensive and left me hungry.  The sangria pitchers were expensive and small. The minimalist modern restaurant decor seemed dated and the overall dining experience was not worth the price of admission.  This might work for a college student looking to impress his date but for grownups  unless you had your stomach recently stapled  I would pass on the hyped cuisine of chef Jose Garces.\"\n",
      "If you're expecting the traditional Taco joint menu  go elsewhere. Distrito is my favorite Mexican option in Philly. Great food and drinks in a really fun atmosphere.   This place is not for everybody. Its bright  its loud  and its young. Don't bother going here if you're expecting a good value. Distrito is probably a bit overpriced  but its worth it. On the downside  the service can be a bit unreliable  and the layout is a little too big for my liking.    Overall  its definitely worth the trip.\n",
      "The food here was great  a very special treatment of a lot of standard mexican food. The atmosphere was a little more casual than some of Garces's other restaurants  I wish the price was a little more casual though.\n",
      "Debated whether or not to give 4 or 5 stars  but finally convinced myself that our overall experience was worth 5.  We went as a party of 10  and made reservations  however they gave us 2 separate tables that were not close enough for us. After requesting a different table  at first they didn't want to accommodate  however they did finally give us a table for all of us after making us wait another 20 minutes or so.  Aside from this one hiccup  the rest of the evening was actually quite enjoyable. First off  I have to mention  that the house margaritas are killer! I would definitely recommend ordering a few glasses  or better yet a few pitchers  to go with your meal!  The food is tapas style  and it is meant to be shared. 90% of our group was vegetarian (I was the only holdout lol)  so we got double orders of chips & guacamole and the veggie nachos for appetizers. The guacamole was very good  clearly freshly made and very tasty. But the best appetizer was without a doubt the nachos. They come out piping hot and full of flavor  with a great assortment of veggies! Vegetarian or not  order these and you won't regret it!  We had so many dishes for dinner  I can't really remember them all  but in all honesty I decided to order a few meat based dishes for myself. I got the carnitas (pork) tacos  and the queso fundido (with duck barbacoa). The carnitas tacos sounded enticing because of the pineapple salsa  but to be honest this was not very noticeable. All in all a good taco  but got kind of soggy so I would suggest a hard shell for this...But the queso fundido was outstanding! The meat was tender  and the overall dish was perfectly spiced!  On top of the great food  the service was top quality. Our waiter was very patient  which is important when you are a group of 10  and everything came out as ordered in a timely manner. Can't wait to go back and try different stuff (fyi  they have one table that is a \\car\\\"  might want to look into reserving that if you are a group of 4 or less)\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent food  excellent service. Great new Philly vegan restaurant. Tried a sampling of many of the dishes  not a miss in the bunch. Will be back for certain!\n",
      "Wonderful drinks  skilled mixologist! We didn't order any drinks from the menu to see what creativity the bartender could whip up  we told him ingredients & spirits we preferred and let him do his magic... he did not disappoint! To top it off  the ingredients were so fresh and pure  that I didn't feel the usual \\sugar\\\" headache the next morning. I think the fresh squeezed juices actually HELPED my liver lol\"\n",
      "More of a cocktail bar than a restaurant. There`s a great selection of drinks and a very small selection of food. Everything was beautifully made  drinks and food. However  I was not very impressed with the food. The size of each plate is ridiculously small  even for tapas style. The food tasted good but was nothing special to justify the portion size and price. I`ve had better vegan food at other places  for comparable price. The drinks were really good though!!! So maybe I`ll come back again for drinks when I`m not hungry.\n",
      "Great cocktails  bartenders  and servers! Delicious vegan food. Loved the avocado toast and the bao buns  especially. Sat at the bar and enjoyed every minute. Friendly staff who really took care of us. Thank you! We will be back! Romantic and dimly lit atmosphere. Great for a date or for catching up with a dear friends.\n",
      "Three strikes and I vote this place OUT. Once again  the food was short-portioned and unappealing with overkill or weird combo sauces (raisins and vinegar)  drinks were quite good  but either forgotten  or left sitting bar side so long that the ice had half melted. It was not busy  and hasn't been busy at any time I've gone. This includes a weekday happy hour  weekend prime time  and Thursday night at 8:30. And  it's the second time we all had stomach  um  disturbances shortly after eating. The decor is a murky  dirty blue  and has oddly shaped and very uncomfortable chairs in the front lounge area. The bar itself is attractive and bartenders are skilled. A highlight - beautiful and interesting wallpapered bathrooms with soothing lighting. Good thing  since after eating the food  you may need to spend some extra time in there.\n",
      "As a person who is always willing to try things atleast once  I am glad that I went. The decor is nice and there was a lot of interesting conversation about the food. That said  the dishes were thoughtful  but since their niche is veggie wish they has pushed the envelope on technique to showcase vs. as many dishes that used them in lieu of meat.\n",
      "Great place for craft cocktails and ambiance.    They care about their ice  and for an old fashioned and many other cocktails  quality of ice can make or break the drink.  CWAS is making great ice  forming the foundation for great drinks.\n",
      "Finally get to try this place. Awesome food. Amazing staff and good ambience.  Drinks: pimms cup ( nice cucumber flavored) and 100 years of solitude ( spicy jalapeño flavored). Both the drinks were amazing. Avacodo toast - in love with it was super duper delicious. Crispy tofu roll - second fav. Gave a kind of veg sushi flavor to it. Smoked cauliflower - a lil blend for the taste but was already told about it so no complains. Like the taste of golden raisin. Gave a good flavor to it. Bucatini and meatballs - spicy!! Though we did ask for it. Was really nice. Good flavor of marinara sauce.  Tried peach tart for dessert - i wasn't a big fan of it but my husband loved it. Too much peach for me. Overall good service and good recommendation by server based on our taste. He gave all the recommendations to U.S. based on the kind of taste we were looking for and was all perfect. 10 on 10. Limited and rotating menu. Will definitely want to try the next menu too.\n",

      "We went to this restaurant after running in the Philadelphia marathon.  We had a large group (12) with us including kids (ages 10-14)  parents and grandparents.   The place is very clean and looks fairly new or at least newly decorated.  The service was excellent and friendly.  The food was very good for the parents but everything was on the spicy side which was not so great for the kids and grandparents.  The lighting was very dim which was an issue for the grandparents reading the menu.    The Veggie wings were great as were the cactus and sweet potato burritos.   The guacamole was very good although the spicy chips were a little too much.  They offer pitchers of margaritas which was great for our large group.\n",
      "I loves me some seitan  and that's why I keep going to El Camino. The seitan wings & seitan nachos are so good! Unfortunately  the service is not. It can be extremely slow. On one occasion it took them so long to get my seitan nachos out to me that they had to give them to me on the house. All of my friends were done eating and ready to leave and I was JUST getting my food!   As for the rest of the food at El Camino  the only other thing I've tried would be the fried pickles. I have to say  I was not impressed. I love both pickles and fried things but these were not good. The coating was too grainy and I just didn't like the taste.   The seitan is so good that it keeps me coming back. And the margaritas are pretty good too.\n",
      "At first I thought the prices here were pretty decent  but then I realized that they charge for every add on- chips salsa  rice and beans  etc. I would be fine with this if the food was exceptional  but it is subpar. Both times I've been here  my side order of rice has been hard and dry  and burritos sad and limp. Additionally  the waitress we've had the two times going there had a horrible attitude. The only thing that saves this place is the guac  and the strong margaritas. Their strategy must be to get people drunk enough to not care about what they're eating and the rude service.\n",
      "Hands down the best veggie wings I've had anywhere. Seriously. I can never stop thinking about them. Their fried pickles are also great  though I've found their drinks to be a bit weak. I'll stick to a Mexican coke whenever I'm here.\n",
      "All you can drink brunch? Yes please!  Sat and Sun they got brunch item and unlimited bloody marys or mimosas for $20. Perfect for some Sunday Funday. Enjoy!\n",
      "We live in the neighborhood and have eaten here many times. I feel as if this restaurant is going downhill. This time we were there for dinner early on a Sunday. The bathrooms were filthy. There are 2 and one was not usable due to all of the paper towels that had been put into the toilet (there was no toilet paper). The other one was usable but also no toilet paper. Our server  Ashley  was not interested in providing any semblance of customer service...RUDE! We had a simple question about the beers on special and she became quite defensive. My daughter spilled her drink  which I realize is a pain in the ass for the restaurant and server (although we were outside so it wasn't that big a deal). We apologized profusely but she didn't even try to hide her annoyance. Finally  the chicken quesadilla should have been labeled the gristle quesadilla....more fat than actual meat...yuck. We love the proximity of this place to where we live and it was great in the past but not anymore...will likely not return...not with so many better quality restaurants in Northern Liberties and Fishtown.\n",
      "This is our go to spot for happy hour.  Half price margarita pitchers and great food. I love their smoked wings  texas style chili  steak tacos  and turkey BLT.  Actually i've never had a bad meal here.  When in doubt we go to el camino and always end up having a great meal and wondeful time.\n",
      "So the atmosphere was awesome for this second visit. The service was great again  had a male waiter this time and he was very good. Came and refilled out chips once  cleared plates in good time as we were done  and just overall really nice. Again  didn't feel rushed at all which was prefect because we were watching the phillies game so stayed awhile after our meal. One dissapointing part though.. the smore bread pudding i was so excited for  completely not what i was expecting. It was basically two less dense chocolate brownies with a graham cracker sitting on top and marshmallow ice cream. Of course it tasted good but I wouldn've thought it would be a bread pudding with a graham cracker crust or something  not just a graham cracker thrown on top. So that's my only negative part about this place.   Fried pickle chips  delicious! Make sure you let them cool  they taste so much better when they're not burning hot.\n",
      "This is where I head when I get that Texas BBQ itch. The brisket sandwiches are delicious  when cooked properly  and the sangria had me feeling nice.   The atmosphere is relaxed. Nice bar seating.\n",
      "I wish I could go back and time and not eat here. We waited 50 minutes for cold chips and salsa  they were stale and they didn't even have picode Gallo. They charge for them! The burrito was cold  and when I asked they said they plate was suppose to be cold. Really? Cold rice and beans too?  The margarita was the only good thing and the 80's music.\n",
      "I'd love to try this again based on other's reviews. The night I went  the kitchen was about to close and we got seated upstairs which was almost empty and lacked ambiance. Hoping to get a better vibe next time.\n",
      "Everything here was wonderful-the food  service  all of it. Played are a bit small and pricy but nonetheless we will be back!\n",
      "Arrived here at 4:40 to ensure that we would get a seat and we did right away. Kitchen doesn't even open until 5  if that says anything about the usual wait. We had Richard as a server who was absolutely fantastic  very knowledgeable about the menu (apparently he used to be a chef here)  very friendly.   Started with pumpkin & brown butter toast and a scallop ceviche. I found the toast relatively average  not worth the price tag  on the other hand  the scallop ceviche was pretty incredible  a very well thought-out blend of flavors and textures complementing the scallop pieces themselves.   Then she had half the amish chicken  and I had the sea bass. It was honestly the best cooked fish I've ever had  with a perfectly crisp skin bordering the tender and flaky meat. All served on some vegetables in an exquisite broth. The way I'm talking about it  I have to agree that Vernick does live up to the hype.   Dessert was the jewish apple cake and the semifreddo. Both very unique  very tastefully done. I would have to say the one weakness I felt they had was the cocktails. Reasonably priced yes  but they aren't the best I've ever had (Charlie's keeps its title in my book).\n",
      "Best meal we've had in Philly. We ordered about 10 dishes  a variety of small and large plates to share between four people - perfect for sampling and felt very satisfied at the end of the meal. Each dish was amazingly fresh and well-balanced with stunning presentation. Absolutely delicious. Highlights were the toasts (crab was so good) - cauliflower  crudos  pastas  sea bass ... on second thought it's actually challenging to think of a highlight because we enjoyed everything. Strong  tasty cocktails and great service rounded out an excellent night. The only thing we didn't try was the dessert  so that'll be our excuse to return!\n",
      "Down in Philadelphia for the night and decided to give this restaurant a chance after reading the Yelp reviews. It didn't disappoint. Sat comfortably at the bar  good service from both the hostess and the bartender. Food was very fresh and well prepared. Started with very fresh avocado on toast and then moved on to a very nice pork shoulder  though a bit chewy. But  the winner was my wife's roasted half chicken: very juicy and flavorful. As has been mentioned on the reviews here before  the blueberry dessert with vanilla ice cream is a must try.\n",
      "Vernick Is a place I would definitely take a date and hopefully you get the cute seats on the second floor by the outdoor balcony.    As far as the food goes.  It was pretty good.  The ones I recommend is definitely try the Pea and Bacon toast.  I still drool thinking about it.  The grilled octopus was prepared very well and the hamachi were the ones that stuck out!    Of course dinner wouldn't be complete without dessert.  We went for the mini cookie sandwiches.  They were sooooo good and definitely helped end the meal well!   For service  I thought it was a little bit slow.  We waited a little too long in between plates and I felt like my server was gone alot and didn't really check back as much.\n",
      "The food here is excellent  especially the small plates. I would skip the mains and order the uni  tuna tartar  and the raw salmon dish. Their toasts are also good. This place would be 5-star if it weren't for the price. For the size of their portions  it's just not good value.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a bit pricey  but its money well spent!   I like to call their Martinis custom made! If you just ask the bartender to make a special martini for you he will wow you with the preparation and the taste. I personally take my good sweet time drinking these specially prepared Martinis  not only because I know I'm paying for it  but because of how serious he is about preparing it. Ok if the Martinis are this good... Wait till you try their dishes!!! My mouth is watering just thinking of it! Every dish is prepared with so much flavor. Like the Martinis  I don't want the experience to end as I take each bite  I do it with such ease because I indulge in each moment  so not to forget it. Hahaha! Yes I know what you're thinking! It's a foodgasm!   So although it's a bit pricey  foodgasms are worth every dime!\n",
      "Great meal last weekend at Vernick.  We had the nicest server (with handlebar moustache  Kaleb). Food was all sustainable  farm to table  small plates.  Scallop crudo was excellent  as was the avocado toast w/ spicy radish. Interesting cocktails.....I had the NEWgroni w/ grapefruit and Aperol.  Salad with a crusted egg was delicious  as was the sea bass w/ broccoli and olives.  We shared a lot of small plates and had a really fun night upstairs.   Philly is a great food city  can't wait to go back!\n",
      "I love this place. I have been here multiple times  & it only gets better everytime. The staff is AMAZING! The bouncer Eric was extremely nice.  We went there for a friends birthday this weekend & EVERY staff member I encountered was beyond helpful & friendly. (I can not say the same for barcade down the street) The beer selection is great. There are rows of large picnic tables in an outside seating area so there is always somewhere to sit. I will be be back!\n",
      "\n",
      "One word describes my overall Frankford Hall experience: meh.  Likes: the ample seating  the lighting  the games at the tables.  Dislikes: paying $8 for one sausage (and having to pay extra for a bun)  the onions in the cheese dip that comes with the pretzels  the paper plates everything is served on  not knowing what idiot is going to plop down at your table and make himself at home  the lame bouncers at the door  the valet parking.  Try this place once  if you want. And then stick to the other local bars and restaurants. The \\experience\\\" just didn't live up to what this place is clearly shooting for.\"\n",
      "I've never had anything other than a great time here. The food is great  but this place is all about the atmosphere and whom you're with.  Roast some mallows on the fire  play some jenga  get an ice cream cone. (Why don't other bars serve ice cream cones? Jackpot). Food comes out quickly and is delicious.  Depending on the day and weather  you can wait in line for quite some time. Just a heads up. Worth it  though.\n",
      "visited here this past sunday afternoon on 5 5 13 for the first time.....i have heard mixed reviews so i figured let me try it for myself since i love german food and there is not too many places around where you can get it....so let me make it simple. ......the food...verygood   had brat wurst w  sauerkraut   potatoe salad and fries....reasonable price.......had a couple of german beers   cold and reasonable price.....open air area w  picnic tables you share....very cool......................the downside.....too many little kids running around while thier yuppie mothers and fathers i guess think it's cool....very annoying.......they hand out jenga games if you want them so now your eating and the  ass next to you thinks it's funny when the blocks fall and hit your food.....not cool.....if you think there is going to be traditional german music playing....well not here...it was regae  some rap and i guess you would say some teckno........it again wasn't what i expected for a so called germanbeer garden......also the waitresses act like robots  not too friendly and they are worrying too much on how they look....but the gentleman hostess at the door was VERY friendly (but i forget his name) and at least he gave us a little history on the area and about other pubs in the area.....really cool!......checked out the toilets and they were just o.k.....not spotless!........would i come here again....maybe in the afternoon during the week but never on a weekend again.....one person told me that it really gets roudy at nite....not 4me\n",
      "I love this place.  Any time I have out of town guests  I try to come here.  Great giant pretzels  boozy milk shakes  beers  brats... It's just a great way to chat with friends and enjoy the weather and people watch.\n",
      "Great Steven star restaurant in a hipster part of Philadelphia. The lighting and attention to detail was nearly perfect except for the bar. The horse shoe design made for difficult ordering when the bar was crowded. The acoustics is also pretty deafening.   Prices of the beer were fair with several different option sizes. The food was not bad but fette sau bbq next door was much better.   Overall  it's a fun place for crowds and I'll definitely be back.\n",
      "I don't normally head up to feeshtown to hang out. It's become Chad city lately. Everywhere I look there are Land Rovers  salmon colored slacks  and piped shirt collars. Frankford Hall is one of the few reasons I'll head up to this neighborhood.   It's situated closely to the El  and has tons of space. The food isn't like crazy authentic German  but a more palettable Americanized version. There are different types of sausages  schnitzel (my fave)  and giant Bavarian pretzels. It'd be downright criminal to get a pretzel without the cheese sauce.   Lots of seating and if it's really packed  you'd probably be fine just standing around. There's a large courtyard inside  well  technically outside. I mean it's a courtyard which is outside  but inside the establishment.  You know what I mean. There are ping pong tables too.   They have $5 1/2 liters of German beers for happy hour from 4-7 weekdays.   Super side note: they throw a family friendly party for Christmas every year with a pretty rockin live band. And the Santa has a real beard.   The ONLY problem is it's in tunatown\n",
      "Great bar. Great beer list. Great outdoor area that worked for either the winter or summer. The outdoor area is the highlight of this place. It's huge and they have a lot of picnic benches set up with trees to give shade during the hot summer months. In the winter they have fire pits and heated lamps everywhere which makes you forget it's 30 degrees outside. Also in the winter they have s'more packets at the bar for the fire pits  nice touch. It's also one of the few bars that has a lot of games set up - ping pong  corn hole  fuse ball. The only food I've had here is the soft pretzel which is really good but sometimes it has too much salt on it. This was our go to spot for happy hours or after dinner drinks.\n",
      "I wasn't overwhelmingly impressed with this place  but the space is huge and the booze is decently priced.  From what I understand  it's pretty new  and they were having all sorts of issues with kegs when I went  but I'm sure it will all iron itself out.\n",
      "This place has a great staff  plentiful TV's for watching whatever game you'd like and loads of beers to choose from. If you're looking for a laid back place to watch a game  this is a great option. Plenty of tables in this not-small-but-not-large bar. Not to mention it's the oldest running bar in Philly? Can't go wrong  as a beer lover. They've got a full bar as well  but that's not what brings in the crowd.\n",
      "Great piece of history.  Cool building on a narrow street.  Inside  tons of local memorabilia to interest the eyes  befitting Philadelphia's oldest continuously serving bar.  Super lunch  cheap and filling.  Sweetheart of a server  awesome service.  Nice touch:  self-serve complimentary soups with lunch.  Fill a crock and sit in front of a roaring real fireplace (not fake  as another Yelper suggested).  I'll have to venture back for that outdoor fall festival and dare I say: St. Patrick's Day.  A good time.\n",
      "I went here before and after a scavenger hunt. We were starving afterwards and decided to get chicken tenders  which were pretty much your average heated-up-from-frozen fare. Good enough for what we wanted at that moment  but just based on that  I probably wouldn't rush back. Also  I'm not a huge fan of it being in an alley with dumpsters and stuff. But apparently the beer list is good  so maybe that's a reason to try it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite bar in Philadelphia  with great Karaoke nights. I am not sure what it is that draws me to McGillins... but it can be really crowded and noisy  boisterous  and I always have a lot of fun! It's so alive  great atmosphere... and they have pretty cheap food beers.  It's definitely not the place for a quiet get together  but it's a nice place to hang out with friends if you're not looking for quiet! I think it's also the best place to be in Philly on St. Paddy's Day! You get people of all ages too  though age takes a back seat here. My friend had this 2 hour long conversation with a guy 3x his age (in spite of the noise level) and left smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4* for the building  the service and the local beers. The food is pretty good but small portions and just basic bar fare. The true champion is the building itself. It's an amazing place located in basically an alley. They have seemed to keep or restore the doors and windows to original period. The actual working fire place was great for my mom who wanted to shake off a chilly walk from the flower show. The staff is super friendly and well versed in both the menu and beer list. My girlfriend said the Shepards pie was a little watery. Both of our mothers really liked the French onion soup. I had the house roast beef sandwich. It was tasty but light on meat and only received a half cup of au jus. We heard it was haunted but I guess not at 2pm on a Sunday with a full house.\n",
      "I read the reviews  was a little reluctant to come to a frat house type bar  but came anyway. Maybe because it's a Sinday evening  but I would just call it typical pub: loud  young and older  couples groups singles.  Bottom line is decent food (I had chicken nachos)  great selection of microbrews (the McGillin's ale is fabulous)  walking distance from my hotel  and who can resist the oldest tavern in Philly?  On most trips I avoid eating at the same place twice  but I'll make an exception for McGollin's\n",
      "\n",
      "I LOVE THIS PLACE. I come here all the time. The margaritas are the best and the food is delicious. Come here for happy hour and fish tacos are a buck a piece. Love the atmosphere  love the service. I always come back. They don't take reservations so be prepared to wait a little while to get a table during popular dinner times.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best thing I got here was the corn on the cob. It was DELICIOUS. The best corn on the cob I've had was in NYC but this definitely was close. I tried the one at El Vez  that trash was trash!   Drink wise  I got both the red and white sangria which were okay. Nothing to write home about.  My friend got an appetizer that was pretty much fried cheese in lots of oil and you are suppose to place it on a tortilla and eat it. NO thanks!  I went with the chips and salsa because I've been craving it. It was a disappointment. The salsa was all wrong. No uhmph.  More people came to join my party and they ordered the guacamole..again nothing special. I think the El Vez 'mole is actually better.  So the main meal- I got the taco spread (comes with most of the meat found in the individual taco orders).   We replaced the pork with halibut ($2 extra or so).  It was decent. A meal for 2. I was def full.  The individual tacos are small.  Other members got the enchiladas and I think they were very happy with it.  The waitstaff- very pleasant and attentive.  Overall  not a place I would go back to to (except to get that tasty ass corn on the cob). I wouldn't dissuade any from going there either but I think they are better options around.\n",
      "I'll most likely re-write this review once I'm able to explore the actual menu outside their happy hour  but then again  you really can't beat this happy hour so why would I want to do that?  Dollar tacos are obviously going to keep me coming back here.  Pair that with a $4 classic margarita or a $5 specialty margarita and you're set.  Plus there's $2 and $3 snacks like chicken enchiladas and tostadas.  You get what you pay for.  The tacos are MINI (I ordered 5 and was still hungry)  but the fillings and fresh corn tortillas are still tasty.  Skip the \\steak\\\" taco (it's not steak at all  it's more like braised short rib or some type of beef chuck roast) and opt for all fish tacos since they're delicious and served with a crunchy slaw on top.  Hell  order 10 fish tacos and for $10 you've pretty much got yourself a meal.  Chicken tacos are okay.  There's also cheese and veggie options.  The margaritas are BANGIN'.  Super strong but still super tasty- mixed perfectly.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I got the classic.  Friends got the special one that night which was chipotle/pineapple. Super fresh and with just the right aftertaste of spice.  We still ordered the guacamole cause we're at an authentic taqueria.  What  am I NOT gonna order guac?  Anyway  that was super tasty as well- the right balance of chunky and smooth.  Maybe a little bit bland for my liking  but that huge woven basket of fresh  warm  salty  homemade tortilla chips makes it all worthwhile.  It reminds me of a cheaper El Vez and cute like Oscars or another dive bar on the inside with low lighting and 70's kitsch everywhere you look.  Will definitely be back here again.\"\n",
      "Dinner was over priced. I got the calamares  which was in a sauce that tasted like liquid salt and smelled like a fish market. I threw up this morning  I think it may have something to do with dinner.\n",
      "I LOVED this place.  My entire party enjoyed their meals  and the guava margarita was delicious.  The guac is expensive at $10  but all the other entrees were pretty reasonably priced. I'd definitely go again!\n",
      "El Rey has become one of my favorite restaurants in Center City for several reasons.  As a generally picky customer when it comes to food  atmosphere  price  and portion-size  I'm happy to say that El Rey hits all of my personal preferences perfectly.  First  the location is fantastic.  It's right off Rittenhouse Square easily accessible from most Center City offices  public transportation  and hotels making working dinners or dates very easy.  The decor is quite obviously Starr-esque in that it's contrived  but obviously so  but it creates a very casual  current vibe that is welcome.  I've never felt out of place wearing shorts and a t-shirt here or coming right after work in a tie.  Second  the food is fresh and good.  The portions are pitch-perfect in that they do not leave you feeling overly full but sated  though I would suggest indulging in the nachos prior to the entree if you are particularly hungry as the tacos (quite good!) are somewhat limited in their size  and even the enchiladas (also quite good with shredded chicken or beef!) won't lay heavily in your gut.  Finally  the prices are obscenely reasonable for a Center City restaurant of this style.  I've never had a dinner (including a glass or two of wine with a friend  two entrees  and an order of the nachos or chips and salsa) exceeding $50 (including 20%+ gratuity!)  The staff is always attentive  friendly (but not in a fake sense)  and the place is always busy (but not in an obnoxious way.)  If you are looking for something new along Chestnut (somewhat off the beaten path for those of us living in Center City!)  definitely give El Rey a chance.  I'd be surprised if you were disappointed.\n",
      "My first thought  although this place had been hyped to me  was \\meh.\\\" We came here for dinner on a Sunday night and service was very slow. Luckily we didn't have anywhere else to go so we were patient  but slightly frustrated. The food was also meh  although the chips and salsa were delicious  and overall I'd just say it was your standard Mexican place -- go here if you want generally appealing food in a central location in the city. Their movie poster decor was pretty awesome  though.\"\n",
      "I guess what it comes down to is what you are looking for in a restaurant with a reputation like El Rey.  El Rey's reputation  however  is intimately tied to El Vez's reputation since they are both Stephen Starr restaurants.  But I do not think that that's fair  because they are two totally incomparable restaurants besides two things:  they're both Stephen Starr restaurants and they're serving Mexican food that appeals to us non-Mexicans.   El Rey is an establishment that screams \\LOVE ME FOR WHO I AM\\\".  You know?  So  to me  that makes it more approachable...makes the menu more approachable =).  So I ordered what I would usually order on a lovely ladies night - margaritas.  Actually  make that (2) mango margaritas =) And the other ladies had sangrias.  Ok ok  I did question El Rey's margaritas: were they as good as El Vez's frozen orange margaritas?  Well  first off  the mango margaritas weren't frozen...but the taste of El Vez's frozen orange margaritas were better...but that was the ONLY item on El Vez's menu that I liked that night.  Ok  see how incomparable El Rey and El Vez STILL are in my mind?  Oy vey  I'm getting frustrated...  Anywho  what else...oh yeah  the chips and salsa and the carnitas tacos that I had were amaaazzinggg.  Ahh  I would totally come back and get excited all over again.    Ok  bottom line: give El Rey a break - look at it for what it truly is  which shouldn't be just El Vez's shadow.\"\n",
      "A fantastic Steven Starr restaurant  probably the best Mexican food in Phila. Everything tastes great  staff is always super nice  convenient location.\n",
      "Love this place!  Got a recommendation from a friend - called valentines weekend and he was able to find us a table  last minute.  It was a later time slot then I wanted - but worked out since it gave us a chance to get the kids down  before we went out.  I rate things on: Taste  Service  Price  Portion size and atmosphere.  All were very good - but it was a bit loud which took away from the dining experience a bit  but hey - it's center city Philly on a Saturday night- it's going to be loud no matter where you go!\n",
      "I enjoyed a fun Saturday night date with my husband at this charming neighborhood BYOB Italian restaurant over the weekend.  It was a delicious meal at a great price and we will definitely be back.  My craving for pasta hit around lunchtime on Saturday  and I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to get a reservation for that night - albeit at 9:30.  We drooled over the online menu  picked up a nice bottle of red and were seated promptly when we arrived for our reservation.  Service throughout the evening was very friendly.  There were a few minor delays  but the restaurant was legitimately packed.  We started our meal by sharing the BLT salad  which was comprised of baby arugula  tomatoes  crispy pancetta and shaved parmesan nicely complemented by an appropriate amount of limoncello vinaigrette.  They split the salad onto two plates in the kitchen  which is always a nice touch.  For entrees the husband had a pork loin special with spinach and roasted potatoes in a white wine sauce while I had a pasta special of homemade fettuccine with sausage and wild mushrooms.  The pork loin was flavorful and properly cooked  but I think the poor guy had dinner envy because my pasta was out of this world fantastic!  The sausage  mushrooms  and sauce were all divine  but the noodles themselves would have been exquisite just with butter and parmesan.  I think taking advantage of all of the homemade pastas is the way to best enjoy Giorgio.  The portions were generous and we were sure we could not handle dessert . . . until we saw the creme brulee delivered to the table next to us.  Let's just say I am glad we made room for it.  The only real downside was that the restaurant was loud.  I wouldn't usually dock a star for this  but it was skull-rattling  could-not-hear-the-waitress  could-not-have-a-conversation loud.  We had the misfortune of being seated in the upper room with two very large and very drunk bachelorette parties  so I am hoping it is usually a little better.  I am glad they were having a nice time  but when one group broke out a strobe light and started blowing their penis whistle party favors  a little polite intervention from the staff might have improved the night for other diners.  Oh well - if it is just regular \\Saturday night loud\\\" on our next trip  a star will be immediately added back.  Mangia Bene!\"\n",
      "I really enjoyed this place  and so did my husband (vegetarian) and grandfather. The service was friendly and helpful (the happy medium between overly attentive and too slow). The food was great (I had the homemade ravioli which were amazing)  and they had delicious homemade desserts (which were the high point for my husband and included a tiramisu  a pumpkin creme brulee  and they also gave us a slice of homemade chocolate cake on the house that was moist and yummy). This was the best meal I have had out in a while  and I can't wait to go back.  Went back for a family birthday dinner  and it was even better than I remembered. The food was incredible  and the owner was so warm and welcoming. For once  my entire family was impressed  and I don't think that has ever happened before.\n",

      "Awesome.  Had the ribeye  pasta with clams  and roasted veggies. Great flavor and service.\n",
      "To be quite honest  I was looking forward to catching up with my roommate while having a nice  relaxing meal paired with some wine but this place was a complete zoo on a Friday evening! Most of our conversation was along the lines of \\Sorry  What did you say??\\\" \\\"Huhh? It's so loud!\\\" \\\"Oh man  I have such a headache!\\\"  Pros: BYOB and Gluten-free options Cons: Loud/Noisy  \\\"handmade pasta\\\" but wasn't cooked thoroughly  overpriced & bland ($52 for 2 plates of a 'special' fettuccine - one with meat and one with seafood)  I will probably give this restaurant one more try (on a weekday) and order anything than a pasta.\"\n",
      "I dined here last night with my family for my birthday. It was my second time  and it was just as good as the first time I tried this place. The food is simple with fresh ingredients. We ordered the linguine with clams  ribeye  chicken valentina  and the parmesan encrusted pork special. That pork chop was the best I ever had. We were all raving about it. It is a small place that gets packed even on a weeknight  but our waitress was great! At one point  she did get backed up while we were waiting to order dessert coffee. She comp'ed the dessert because of the delay. BEST creme brulee I have ever had  and I'm not even a dessert person. Overall excellent experience.\n",
      "Yes for the gluten-free options! Yes for the service! Yes to the other patrons who fill the air with happy conversation! Definitely a great place to have a casual meal whether with family  friends  or a fun date.\n",
      "Gorgio's continues to impress me  time and time again. They have amazing food and their gluten free selection is phenomenal. I get the beef ragout almost every time. It's so delicious!\n",
      "Best Italian restaurant I've been to in Philly!  I hosted my 30th birthday dinner in their private dining room with 37 family & friends.  The space was amazing  the staff members were so accommodating and the food was unreal.  Giorgio also allowed us to drop off all of our own beer wine in the morning so we did not have to bring with us to dinner.  The food  was awesome!  Appetizers were served family style for the party and everyone selected their own entree which were all hot & delish.  The dessert  chocolate cake & tiramisu came as a duet and was also amazing!!\n",
      "Always amazing. Menu changes. Most delicious tomato soup w grilled cheese croutons  the most amazing asparagus Parmesan truffle soup you will ever meet  life changing huevos rancheros  and many hard to choose from brunch options. Lunch and dinner are also deserve high fives. Retro diner set-up inside and eclectic and colorful backyard seating.\n",
      "Very cool spot and unique spot in philly. It's got the diner look to it but the walls on the outside have very unique painted art on it which gives it character. The outside of the restaurant is so unique that we did engagement photos there. There's very nice outdoor seating in the back that feels like you're in a garden with all the trees around but also provides some much needed shade in the hot summer months. During the day it's a restaurant - with GREAT food and at night the other side turns into a nightclub with fantastic music.  Food & Drinks - Thai chili wings are a must order every time we come here. Even if it is for brunch  we always order these wings. Blood Mary's are strong with a slight kick. All other brunch items we've had over the years were also great. We came here a lot over the years we lived in philly and never had a bad meal.  Night club - awesome dance music. I used to have a blast here and leave with sore feet from all the dancing.\n",
      "I have to be completely honest.  I had the french toast and it was really good UNTIL I found a bright orange food label (those cheap price stickers you see at a farmer's market) on a piece of the sliced fruit and hidden under some whipped cream.  At that point I was done with the meal.  The waitress apologized and just took the food away  didn't offer to replace the food or make something else.  She came back about 10 minutes later to ask my girlfriend if she was done with her meal and if we wanted dessert or anything else  no mention of the foreign item found in the french toast.  We just asked for the check.  When she delivered the check she informed us that french toast had been taken off of the bill (obviously).  Then the manager came over and made situation even worse.  My girlfriend and I had just come from the Punk Rock Flea Market so we both had pink wrist bracelets on.  The manager again told us that the french toast was taken off of the bill and said that it was a pink piece of a bracelet (like the one I was wearing) that was in the food.  He was insinuating that I either accidentally or purposefully put a piece of my bracelet into my own food.  I told him that he was wrong  there was a very distinct difference between the bright pink bracelet I was wearing and the bright orange label with a price inked on it  that I found.  He said  \\No  I'll show you  I have the label right over here.\\\"  He came back with a very shamed look on his face when he realized that I was right and said  \\\"Oh  it seems to be a label  someone told me it was a wristband.  Anyway  we took care of it for you.\\\"  Still never apologizing and still acting like he was doing me a favor.  I was very disgusted with the customer service more than anything.  In any other case I'd expect the waitress and especially the manager to not only do everything they could to replace the meal or offer something as a substitute  but not argue or bring conflict in the middle of the establishment.  My experience was that the staff was very unprofessional.  Just because the diner is trying to set itself apart as being \\\"hip\\\" and \\\"eccentric\\\" doesn't mean the service should be anything less than professional and courteous towards their customers.\"\n",
      "Dance floor is a blast  drinks are good  and all over a lot of fun. It's usually pretty crowded  but it's still a good time.\n",
      "What else can you ask for in a place... diner  out door seating and dance club all in one.   I went on this past Saturday night  not expecting too much because of the holiday weekend. At 10:30 it was pretty dead  but I wanted to get there before they started charging cover.  My friends and I went to the bar/club side  only a few people scattered around. Then we decided to head over to the other side to get something to eat. Pretty nice space we opted for the out door area since it was so nice out. Definitely more crowded than the other side.  They have $2 high lifes that my friends took advantage of. I stuck with the food again. Some plain old wings and fries. Not to shabby. The wings were very well cooked  the meat fell right off the bone  you didn't need to fight with it to get the meat off.   After the little snack we decided to go back to the dancing. The place filled up. And people were all over the dance floor  had a bit more life than when we first walked in.   Next time I stop in I'll have to try the breakfast.\n",

      "Strictly A Brunch Review !  I would venture to say that I have eaten brunch at damn near every place in or around no-libs... and this place has emerged as my favorite.  I had a former favorite that I will not name  but we go here everytime we want brunch now.  They have awesome specials  and a great menu otherwise.  The lounge may smell like old booze early in the AM  but suck it up and enjoy the food.\n",
      "Name me a SINGLE other restaurant where you can get steak and eggs with grated truffles  truffle vinaigrette for $14.    I'm still waiting...\n",
      "I love this place  where else in Philly can you dance your butt off and then eat pancakes?  The music is always fun  the drinks are ok  ... the pancakes are ok too.\n",

      "This was my first time eating sushi. My daughter suggested Bleu   and let me say that I really enjoyed the food  service and ambiance. I can't wait to go back for more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ordered sushi rolls: Market  UPenn  and Jefferson rolls. Sushi rolls were great!  I also ordered the Kimchi chicken fries (a MUST ORDER) theses were hands down my fav! It's sweet and cheesy (wiz cheese) not so spicy like your typical kimchi. The chicken was well marinated. They have a lunch special on it were it's $4.95 Monday- Friday.  Service was great. I had asked about the kimchi fries and she highly recommended it and described the taste well. They also give you a complimentary scoop of ice cream.  Overall  great experience I will be going back and I highly recommend this place!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The service here is really good. I love all of the employees that I got to interact with. I didn't have a reservation  but they were super accomodating  The place is nice (really dark just fyi) and the sushi is pretty good. It's not the best I've had  but it's still good. I like that the menu isn't too crazy with lots of items as it makes it easier to focus on what they have to offer.   I also tried the kimchee fries  which were good  but not as over the top amazing/wow/incredible as other reviewers have stated. I'd definitely come back to try out some other things on the menu!\n",
      "Great atmosphere  never too crowded and the sushi is really good. It's a nice trendy place  + BYO!! The rolls named after Philly streets places are a nice touch. I've been here several times and will go back again.\n",
      "Came to this sushi corner after just ordering from here many times. if you're a french fry fiend  definitely and without a question get the kimchi fries. Highly recommend any of their speciality rolls that serve seafood. The Tenth Street is a great roll that is fried  but does not sacrafice the original texture of the seafood. I tried the Pine  which is a vegetarian speciality roll. It was pretty decent  but I could have had a standard vegetarian roll  and it would not have tasted any different to me. All the standard rolls come at a decent price with most being around 4-6 dollars. Overall  the decor of the place was really nice. There were folding chairs along one row of tables  which was questionable because the rest of the restaurant's ambiance indicated a classier vibe. But hey we came to eat and as far as sushi goes  this is a great spot to stop by!\n",
      "I am not sure why this place has so many good reviews. We decided to give this restaurant a second chance after a mediocre first experience  and again it was disappointing.  The tempura while crispy  had an excess of breading  which was not tempura batter.  One roll that we had was eel with avocado  which had more avocado than eel. The rice was soggy and borderline gross  like day old sushi from the cafeteria.  The chicken teriyaki was edible  but the chicken was on the dry side and the sauce was thin. To make matters worse  the rice was hard and unappetizing.  The kimchee fries were over-hyped  covered in a mixture of cheez-wiz  mayo  and a redish sauce. Served with bits of kim chee. This confirmed our first impression that this place is just Meh. I am surprised it has so many good reviews. 2.5 stars\n",
      "Noope  I won't come back. Once again  the groupon deal was unable to save this reviewer from writing an honest review about mediocre sushi with abysmal services.  Must get: arch roll Meh: bleu boat special  drexel roll  house salad  soft shell crabs Missed out: hot entrees  My wife and I visited this quaint spot on a beautiful spring evening and decided to relax and enjoy a discounted sushi dinner  courtesy of Groupon. However  we were not prepared for the whirlwind of faux-pas services. When we decided to sit outdoors  the server filled our water glasses from a half-empty pitcher that's been resting on the neighboring table  that may or may not have been collecting springtime pollen plainly visible on the superficial layer of the ice cubes. Our server  well very polite  was unable to understand our request  seemed to not know the dishes himself  and told us that because we were using the groupon  we weren't able to use it in conjunction with the small $25 deal for two signature rolls + miso/salad. When we finally ordered the food  I had asked for a description of the sashimi  and he realized that he gave me the wrong order and had to take it back. Of course  he was unable to identify the fish and never really came back.  As for the food  nothing truly stood out aside from the arch roll with its soy organic warp provided a unique texture. The soft shell crab was quite...underwhelming given its size and oily carb-heavy shell. The bleu boat special  which included moderate amount of sashimi was also disappointing as the fish consisted of that thawed-out of freezer taste and lacked any flavors that are sought after in well-respected sushi joints. By the time our check arrived  our mood was not sweetened despite the free cinnamon ice cream.  My recommendation  as a patron and lover of sushi  is to really consider training your staff to be fully knowledgeable of your menu items. I don't know what to say about the source of the fish  but it should be improved for further visits.  Food: 1 star Service: 1 star Ambiance: 2-3 stars Price: 2 stars\n",
      "in general  LOVED the food! ...however....  OMFG!!!!!  Wonton Soup! WONTON Soup! WONTON SOUP!!! \\Sure\\\"  your thinking \\\"It's only wonton soup. Big deal.\\\" No  no  no. I've NEVER had such a fantastic experience from such an ordinary staple of Chinese Restaurant Universe. First the wonton wrapper is thin and delicate. The broth is light and tasty! as not to fight with the wontons. Oh! Dear Lord! Let me tell you about the WONTON. The first time my wife and I ate at Sang Kee  naturally I ordered the wonton soup. expecting the \\\"usual\\\" fare.  The waiter placed a large bowl of soup before me. My first clue that these little jewels bathing in ta golden broth   was they are not the usual thick  triangular wads of dough filled with an ground pork with way too much chives.   Instead  I was presented with beautiful  round  delicate little wontons. My first bite was the MOST WONDERFUL FLAVOR AND TEXTURED MORSEL I've EVER ATE! \\\"I'm not exaggerating\\\"  The flavor was much different than I had ever experienced before. First  the pork in the wonton has a roasted  almost smoky flavor  accompanied with two little  perfectly sized  whole shrimp (imagine a sandwich (shrimp/pork/shrimp) in each dumpling.   The wrapper  OH! the wrapper  is so light and delicate you actually taste the filling first BEFORE the wonton wrapper. The broth is light flavorful and satisfying.  This in absolutely when The whole is truly greater than the sum of its parts.   I LOVE YOU  LITTLE WONTONS  Neal\"\n",
      "I've been going to this place since I was a kid visiting Philly with my parents. The food is the reason why I still go today! Huge portions to split with your family and friends. The only thing they need to work on is to have a more attentive staff. Doesn't bother me too much  but a 10 minute wait until the waiter greets you while you're hungry feels like an eternity! Other than that.. place is awesome with amazing food!\n",
      "This place is a corner shop and easy to find. I ordered the duck and roast pork noodle soup. It's delicious and authentic. To take home  I ordered a whole duck and while ginger garlic chicken both $20 each. If I'm ever I'm the area  I'll definitely be back.\n",
      "Food is awesome  its fairly packed most of the time and they provide great customer service. But they are over priced compare to other places in Chinatown with the same quality and service. I would recommend it every once in a while.\n",
      "A quick bite after going to Franklin Institute (saw Sang Kee mini stall at the Reading Terminal during lunch). Had the duck noodle soup and wife had the short ribs Taiwanese special.  She loved it (not to my taste however)  but the duck is great!  Afterwards  the do give you the mini scoop of ice cream (you can order regular scoop if you want)  which are 100x better than fortune cookies or oranges. We got 3- coconut  chocolate mint and green tea.\n",
      "Worst place ever. If I could put a 0 star  I would. Food has gotten worse over the years. Customer service is nonexistent. Manager was extremely rude. Does not want to accommodate guest. It's like they don't care. My family and I will never go back!\n",
      "We held our family reunion here and gathered on the 2nd floor.  What a group we gathered.  The staff was great.  They worked with our crazy schedule and requests and even helped to take pictures.  As always the timing was off so they were patient and made the food after we got done with announcements  games  and introductions.  They have a preset menu for banquets.  Duck (of course)  chicken with beans  shrimp  rice  noodles but my group doesn't eat much meat and Mr. G and I are eating vegan so we altered the menu a bit.  The spring rolls and veggie pan fried dumplings - both so yummy.  The tofu was cut into big chunks so it was a softer than I like it.  The pan fried noodles and mixed veggies were great.  The room was long and narrow and it fit us all.  What a great time.\n",
      "if you are looking for quantity rather than quality for your buck  this place is good.   my friends and i got the set dinner for four. we had five people eat the prefixed dinner and we still had left overs. the set dinner had honey walnut shrimp and i'm usually a huge fan but it tasted stale. The chicken with eggplant was good though.   my friends and i sat near the tv on the second floor. it was hard to get the attention of our waiter. i waved my hands several times but gave up. one of my friends had to walk up to a waiter.   the duck was good but i was disappointed that it didn't come with the fluffy white buns. instead we were given these tortilla looking wraps (my Chinese friend said this was authentic but I personally prefer the white fluffy buns).   the free ice cream was nice. they gave us a variety of ice cream scoops on a plate. there was coconut  red bean  green bean  and ginger. the ginger (orange/yellow colored one) was gross. the others were good.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are only 5 words you MUST say to your waiter upon entering... \\Duck  Pork  Wonton  Noodle  Soup\\\" and I give you a 100 percent guarantee you will be receiving one of the greatest chinese soups that you have ever had. Sang Kee is easily one of the best Chinese restaurants you will go to. I've always ordered the soup there because it's a bit of their specialty- but people i've taken have ordered other dishes and they never disappoint.  The decor is decent as it isn't a hole in the wall- and their more formal dining room is pretty standard upstairs but for a lunch or very casual date it never ceases to satisfy. In fact your significant other will be so surprised that you are in the know with such a great place.   Superior quality food at a great price. Nuff Said.\"\n",
      "Of all the newly opened Philly restaurants I've been to this year  I must say this was the most visually appealing. I think the owners of Sampan and Double Knot did a great job creating an alternative universe nested between two nondescript buildings on the boring side of Sansom St. between 15th and 16th - the side with the parking garage and bare walls that are often lined with dumpsters (not to worry though - there were no dumpsters near the restaurant entrance). The decor is an interesting mixture of industrial and classy  with industrial-looking light fixtures and exposed brick walls  but also antique style furniture  framed mirrors  and paintings. The main dining room feels spacious with its open floor plan and high ceiling. Walking into this space feels like walking into a bygone era.   Though there were a few kinks with service coming from various staff members  our server was friendly and his service was very smooth. His recommendation was ~3 small plates per person. The 3 of us ended up sharing 7 items  ranging from starters to entrees.   Among the starters and small plates  I would highly recommend the Spanish octopus. It was very well-made - flavorful and not chewy. I believe there were 3 medium-sized tentacles. The lamb meatballs  littleneck clams  and burrata were also good  though I felt the burrata was a bit too watery  and in order to go well with it  I felt the bread that came with the dish should be a bit more glutinous.   For our entrees  we tried the diver scallops and hanger steak. Both were outstanding. The scallops were seared to perfection (great texture and flavor)  while the steak was very tender and came with a very good sauce. The pricing is not bad  but I do think the portions are a bit on the smaller side for the price. The scallop dish had 3 pieces  which came with parsnip puree and light garnish  while the steak was cut into 4-5 strips and came with a few shiitake mushrooms. We ordered a side of grilled cauliflower  which was also light.   For dessert  I highly recommend the chocolate cake. It's so moist  not too sweet (which I really like)  and comes with layers of delicious chocolate mousse (or some type of cream with similar texture). Priced at $12 a slice  it's a bit steep  but considering how phenomenal it is  I do think it's worth getting. Drink-wise  they have a pretty extensive list. I tried two cocktails and felt they were too sweet  so maybe next time I'll stick with wine or beer with my meal.\n",
      "Lamb Meatballs were delicioso!  Beautiful interior and the young lady at the hostess stand was quite welcoming. I'll be back :-)\n",
      "Probably my new favorite resturant  the food is to die for. I was stuffed and continued to eat. My favorite thing.... if I had to chose one would be the lamb meatballs. Everything from the fig toast  tuna poke  cauliflower  olives  lamb and the clams and spaghetti are also to die for. The pizza was great and baked to perfection. I was told they also have brunch which I honestly want to already go tomorrow to check it out. The ambiance is amazing  I could sit there for hours. They have a downstairs more like a private bar  with 2 lanes for bowling. Would be an awesome night out  which I want to plan to do in the near future. Our server was Brandon  who was super pleasant and would chat as well as make sure we knew what was in everything and made sure he asked about allergies and let us know what we could and could not eat. If I could give this place a 9 I would. The bathrooms are even cool  you'll have to go check it out for yourself.\n",
      "Best place yet in Philly.... great speakeasy like bar down stairs with a bowling alley.. but like a really classy bowling alley. Happy hour is a steal  they literally loose money on it because it's so good. Great staff especially Ryan  and Olivia! Rocking that bar!\n",
      "I had a holiday party at Harp and Crown on Friday the 30th. We had about 25 guests and rented the downstairs space with the bowling ally's for 3 hours of cocktails and food. The space is terrific. Having an activity like bowling was an added plus and my guests loved it. The food just kept coming and my guests loved the pizza  meatballs  cheeses and the mini calzones. The service was attentive and friendly and having had some bad experiences at other venues in the city--this was a huge plus!  If you are considering a party/gathering in center city I give this a big thumbs up! My thanks to the Joe the downstairs manager and all the servers who helped us have a great time.\n",
      "I equivocated for a week about what restaurant to choose for my husband's birthday  but settled on Harp and Crown because of the ambiance and menu.  When we arrived for our 8:30 reservation  we were offered a seat in the front garden area by the window  but I preferred the larger back room. Wasn't a problem  the host came over to the couch where we were waiting and gave us an estimated wait-time--which was well-worth it!  When we were escorted to out table 20 minutes later  we found a spacious booth with two flutes of champagne! Such a thoughtful touch.   Regarding food: my husband wanted to try a little bit of everything  so we ordered the tasting menu. I'm not a big eater  so the seven dishes overwhelmed me a little. I do  however  highly recommend the tuna appetizer and the brussel sprouts. The new salmon entree is also delicious  the dijon glaze was amazing.  As for drinks? The Ruby Slippers is light and refreshing without being a sugar-rush.   Can't wait to take guests here!\n",
      "The seating sucks.  That has to be mentioned first and foremost.  Along the wall they have a giant bench seat broken up into two person sections with an immovable table mounted between them and giant lumpy pillows.  It was uncomfortable and awkward and I could tell everyone else sitting in the area felt the same way by the way they constantly fidgeted and adjusted.  I have no idea WTF someone was thinking. Also  the bar sits in the same area and its loud for a dining area.  Couldn't it be downstairs?  Or closed off?    That said  the people were really nice and attentive and the food was AMAZING.  You know it must be good if it's worth putting up with seating that's less comfortable than the back of an airplane.    Get the tasting menu.  Seven shareable small plates and dessert.  Try a lot of things.  It's the way to go.  It was all good  with the seared tuna cold appetizer and rabbit pasta being the stand outs  in my opinion.  Absolutely worth the price to get completely stuffed on really well-prepared and unique food.\n",
      "As you can see from the pictures  Harp & Crown is a beautiful restaurant and bar. The design is probably the big draw here  understandably so.   In addition to the wonderful atmosphere  Harp & Crown makes great drinks  but I particularly recommend coming for the happy hour. The cocktail and beer options are a bit limited for happy hour  but they are good nonetheless. What's truly impressive is the happy hour food menu. It's not huge  but is both varied and very affordable. What's more  the dishes are full-portion  not sliders or mini-pizzas. I've tried the burger and the fried chicken sandwich  and enjoyed both.   The bar here is usually crowded  but I've had good luck sitting in chairs or on the couch in their lounge area  which to me is better than the bar. It's comfortable  less cramped  and a bit quieter.\n",
      "My new favorite restaurant. Everything was amazing but my favorites were the roasted carrots and grilled octopus. But I don't think it's possible to pick something bad...definitely go for the $45 tasting menu  well worth it.\n",
      "Delightful experience. Honestly one of the best restaurants in Philadelphia  if not the USA. The food  first and foremost  was excellent. We had the roasted olives- quite lovely  cheese plate- heavenly experience with jam and pickled carrots  lamb meatballs- spectacularly savory and unique  roasted brussel sprouts- perfectly cooked and seasoned (I could NOT make this at home)  the ricotta gnocchi- light and fluffy yet rich and savory  and the key lime whoopee pie- a very special  tasty dessert by their pastry chef. This chefs know what they are doing. Masters of their craft.   The atmosphere was trendy  but warm and homey at the same time. We sat in a booth for two  which is unusual at first  but added to the intimate culinary experience. The staff were so experienced and amazing at making the experience exceptional.   Take your next date here. It will go well.\n",
      "I've eaten here a few times and the food was mediocre. Cucumber jalapeño margarita is amazing though I must say. But tonight my friends and I had the worst experience. We came with a party of 10 and was told that in an hour we would be seated which we were fine with. We hung by the bar and ordered drinks happily. After an hour we asked if our table was ready when they told us yes we have you at two different tables across the room from each other. Since we all wanted to sit together as a last night together before our friend moved  we decided to squeeze all at one table. The staff was so annoyed at the fact we all wanted to sit at one table that no busboy or server came over to our table after 30 minutes of sitting there. We asked multiple servers and hosts to send our server over but nothing. When we finally decided to get up and talk to the hostess she was so rude that we all decided it was time to leave. Sad to say that as locals we will have to take our business to a friendlier and more accommodating restaurant.\n",
      "What's better than getting your drink on starting at noon-thirty on a sunny Friday afternoon?  Getting your drink on starting at noon-thirty on a sunny Friday afternoon... outside!  While it's not plentiful  there's seating on the sidewalk in front of Cantina Dos Segundos.  And given that it was midday on a Friday  that not-plentiful seating was plenty enough for us to wash down some enjoyable munchies with a whole pitcher of blood orange margaritas (on the rocks  of course).  They don't screw around with the margaritas here.  It may sound frou-frou  but our blood orange margaritas were not light on the tequila.  Plus  we each had our own little plate of rimming salt (or rimming sugar  as the case may be) for handy personalized re-application between drinks.  Oh.  That's how our meal -started-.  It ended with two \\specials\\\" - a.k.a. \\\"especiáls:\\\" a can of Tecate and a shot of tequila.  Needless to say  after three glasses of margarita  this seemed like a good idea.  And when our server decided that he wanted in on the fun that we were obviously having without him  he decided that he wanted in on another round of tequila shots with us.  That -also- seemed like a good idea at the time.  In retrospect  this may have been detrimental to my overall productivity for the remainder of the afternoon - just don't tell the higher-ups!  Outside of unnecessary amounts of alcohol  my salad mixta was solid.  It didn't look like much but a pile of lettuce  but once you dig down past that  it's chock full of fresh goodness  including creamy avocado  tender hearts of palm  and tangy slices of citrus fruit.  ...And the boy's room is sexy.  Not in a dirty sort of way.  It reminded me a little bit of the bathrooms at the old Patois in Brooklyn.  Down a set of stairs and down a corridor  the light in there is covered with what appears to be custom sheet metal with little star cut-outs.  The scented candles above the sink add to the sexiness.  I'd be willing to return.  Bring on the 'ritas!\"\n",
      "I love the vegan fajitas.  They are a huge portion with enough to lunch the next day  and they fill it up with roasted veggies  smoked tofu  and grilled seitan.  They usually have a vegan special too.    My only complaint is that its usually too noisy.\n",
      "For some reason I always neglect this place even though I walk by it every singe day of my life coming home from work.  Anyway  me and the babe decided to do brunch on Sunday morning after I read all the mostly decent reviews.  Unfortunately brunch does not start until 11 a.m. so we pretend slept until 10:30 to quiet the hunger rumbles from our stomachs.   Got there and were seated immediately by a very friendly waitress.  She talked me into getting the bloody maria which is an AMAZING bloody mary just made with tequila. I ended up getting three because it was so good and refreshing.  Our meals were freaking fab.  My bf got some type of sopes with bacon egg  hollandaise sauce and I got the obnoxious breakfast burrito.  The eggs were fluffly  the rice  beans  salsa and cheese  were just perfection but also totally gross and my stomach said wtf are you doing.  Definitely hit up this place for an awesome laid back brunch.  We were both so satisfied.  I should mention that we went back and immediately fell back to sleep for three hours due to hangover  too much food  etc.  But thank you Dos Segundos for the best bloody Mary I have had in the past three months  and that is saying a lot.\n",

      "I've been here twice. The first time  the food was great and the service was awesome. The second time  the food was great and the service was poor. Common denominator = great food.   The salsas have depth  but I wish they were a little chunkier. The vegetarian veggie tacos are fresh and good but will leave you hungry- even if you add the cheese and some pricey chunks of avocado. The tempeh bacon is smoky and sweet  but it's tempehness still can't be masked- so no trying to trick your carnivore bf into thinking it's real. The vegetarian bean tacos I had at dinner were really delicious and filling. They were stuffed with tasty Mexican rice  flavorful whole beans  and salty cotija cheese and topped with some fresh lettuce and tomato that gave them some crispness. Their corn tortillas don't seem homemade  but they get away with it when the filling is that good.  When we went  they had a special mahi-mahi fish taco. I was skeptical seeing that it was rolled in a flour tortilla and I'm partial to corn tortillas  but they were delicious- just a little spicy  a little creamy  a little crispy  and a lot fresh tasting. Not your standard fish taco but one worth trying.  If the service were more consistent  I would give it one more star.\n",
      "Quality spot for tex mex.  It can't compete with Distrito or Taqueria Veracruzana  but its a solid pick for a cheap night out.  Young crowd  good service  and big drink selection is a plus.\n",
      "This restaurant offered some very interesting (and very tasty) menu options - ones I've never seen at any Mexican restaurant! Also  their cucumber margarita's are amazing!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I really like Garces Trading Company  especially the free olive oil and balsamic tastings they have when you first walk in. The guy behind the cheese counter is super knowledgable and it sounds like a ton of stuff is made in house. The food is always good  though a little expensive for the small portions  which is why I give it a 4. The service is always great and I enjoy the ambiance. The food is unique and inventive  so it's always fun to try something new there.\n",
      "Popped in out of the rain for a quick impromptu lunch and was wowed by how good my meal was.  For $14  you can get soup  a half-sandwich and a non-alcoholic drink.  Not a bargain  you say?  Well....  The soup special the day I visited was a tomato and roasted garlic sop thickened with bread and pureed  then ladled over a gougère  a kind of bready cheese puff. Wow  was that good soup!  I could have eaten two more bowls happily.  The sandwich was roast chicken with pimentón peppers and goat cheese on a crisp yet tender sourdough baguette.  Yowza!  Absolutely delicious and yet so simple.    Service was very prompt and friendly - shout out to Megan!    I left happy and satisfied.  Will be back next time I am in the area!\n",
      "The first time I came here was shortly after it first opened  and we all got sandwiches. They were around $10  and pretty tasty. However  they have since taken sandwiches off their dinner menu  and now nothing costs under $20 except appetizers and small pizzas  and few of those are less than $10. This price jump was an unpleasant surprise the last time I came here.  Nevertheless  we got a Chicago-style deep dish pizza ($31 with one topping = $7 per topping!) and an eggplant appetizer. Both tasted good enough (although the pizza was a bastardization of legit deep dish)  but I now find this place a little too pricey for the cafe-type environment that they're going for  as well as for the food itself. Also  it's always crowded so the service is generally inattentive and ranges from pretty slow to super slow.   Don't get me wrong  I love Jose and I would still marry him. But this particular establishment would be a major point of contention in our relationship (the other being Distrito).\n",
      "Great food and exceptional service. Outside seating  if available  is much more quiet than inside.\n",
      "The food was decent but this family of restaurants (I've patronized a few) seems to have a problem with efficient service. Maybe it's part of the business model to have only one waitress servicing half the tables  but whatever the issue is  it took us about half an hour to get drinks and 45 minutes to get food  and we were visited only sporadically by our waitress (who was very nice and seemed to have a lot of tables). Cheese plate was decent but accoutrement pairing was uninspired. Scallops were cooked nicely but paired with a bland creamy sauce that didn't do a lot to offset the scallop flavor.\n",
      "The food was delicious  the bread and olive oil were so good  and they give you unlimited refills. I got the Moroccan sandwich  which is lamb and a pepper relish and a few other things I can't remember. It was good. My boyfriend got a flatbread pizza with procuttio which was just okay in my opinion  but he liked it. It took several minutes for someone to come to our table or else I would have given the place 5 stars.\n",
      "Garces fan for life! I think this has been my favorite Garces restaurant so far (haven't been to Tinto yet  so I can't really include that one). Trading Co was beyond delicious!  The place looks fabulous. It is located on 11th and Locust  an absolute charming part of Philly  especially during this time of the year (spring). They have tables inside  ranging from small ones (seating 2 people) to larger tables that can seat a large party or several parties together. They also have seating outside that looked absolutely fabulous! We sat inside because it was a little too warm!  When you walk into Garces Trading Co  you can either sit down at a table or walk around and look at the cheeses and meats  the desserts and the wines. We decided to buy a bottle of wine to have during our  meal and we were immediately helped by this amazingly knowledgeable woman. Her recommendation was spot on  and best of all  the wine was not expensive and very tasty.  Our waiter was very attentive. Not once did our water glasses or wine glasses go empty. He took his time to recommend and explain things on the menu  and he even made a little bit of conversation.   We had the chef's selection of three cheeses with condiments. Don't exactly remember what the cheeses were but one was soft  the other semisoft  and the last one hard. The condiments went perfectly well with each cheese (amazing how they know how to pair them). My favorite was the cherry fig marmalade  but the lavender honey and the fennel apricot mostardo were great as well.   Next we had the chef's selection of charcuterie. This was great as well. Everything went great with the wine.  My boyfriend had the Colorado lamb chops served with heirloom potato salad and an amazing glaze. Wow  I will never stop loving lamb. I had the funghi pizza  which was incredibly rich and flavorful. Simply delicious. (Look at the pictures I posted)  Finally we ordered dessert and coffee  both excellent. We ordered a small coffee press that wasn't really that small. In fact  the bf had two cups of coffee  I (who normally don't drink coffee) had one cup  and there was still enough in the fancy little pot to fill another cup and a half. The raspberry marjolaine went great with the coffee and was light enough to finish off an already amazing meal.  I think that what I liked best about Garces Trading Co was that you could either come in for a full meal  or just have a bottle of wine and some appetizers and still have a great time.\n",
      "Came here for dinner with a few friends  it all started very nicley  the waitress was great. She is probably the only reason this place is getting 1 star and not 0. So dear Management please be good to your personnel.(I m not sure of  her name   girl with curly hair and is an actress) Anyway  we came here not knowing what to order so just got a bunch of appetizers   none of which were particularly good  the Potatoe Leek soup was too salty  The sea bass had no flavor  the chicken could of had a bit more flavor to it. The lamb chops caused one of the people from our party a stomach ache. Over all the ambiance is nice  but the food is just not very good and overpriced for poor quality dishes. I wouldn't come back here and def would not recommend others to visit.\n",
      "I am so excited to have Garces Trading Co. around the corner! I've popped over for a quick croissant and ice coffee for breakfast  stopped by for pastries to bring to a dinner party and run in for an emergency last-minute bottle of wine on the way to a byo.  Beautifully convenient.   Also have had two delicious dinners at Garces Trading Co (Mom's birthday in Sept and NYE).  Both meals had a fun \\I'm at a Garces restaurant\\\" without the being too fancy or expensive.\"\n",
      "Holy crap brunch was fantastic. The menu was fix price with a cocktail and a few courses for $25.  The selection of each course we focused  but varied enough for our party of 6 to find their own favorites.  The coffee was good  the drinks were good - and as you would guess the food was great too.    We were there for Easter brunch & it filled up by 11am.  The service was also spot on.    This is a place you should go out of your way for a meal.\n",
      "This place is great! Really good sushi at a discount price. It's not hard to find cheap sushi  but its hard to find cheap sushi that tastes fresh. Not to mention the portions at Vic's are very big compared to over sushi places that cost more with worse sushi.\n",
      "Let me start by saying I'm a sushi Nazi and can smell sushi pretenders from a mile away. If you want authentic sushi  this is NOT the place. If you want Americanized rolls and other \\creative\\\" creations  come on in!  This place is small  cramped  and the I was shocked by the prices they are charging! I spent $30 on 2 rolls and the tuna dumpling and still left hungry. I've spent upward of $150 on a sushi meal. Those are mainly for the experience and the impeccable preparation by master chefs. For this place  I expected Americanized sushi that can fill me up.   Do yourself a favor and just go to the all-you-can-eat sushi place in Center City to get similar quality with unlimited quantity. For the same price...\"\n",
      "Delicious  fresh and reasonably priced sushi!  I had the birthday roll...the tuna was amazingly fresh...it was also beautifully presented with a very good portion size.  You will not be disappointed in this place!\n",
      "great place. the sushi is excellent for the price. they dont pack on the rice  which rules. the place itself is crazy small. i would never stay to eat there if i were with someone. i had some diff veggie rolls which were yummy and fresh and perfect. everything was ripe (the avocado) and crispy (picked root veggies).  also i really like that they provide trashy gossip mags to read while you wait. great place.\n",
      "Spicy Tuna Tartar was presented very creatively and it was really good. Samson Roll was delicious as were the other rolls. The fish was fresh and the rice was nice and sticky. Reasonable prices  casual atmosphere  service was ok. I'd come back again if I was craving sushi.\n",
      "Was kind of disappointed with this place. We rushed inside on a rainy day and was hoping it was going to be a hidden gem seeing the size of the place (very small with one table and more seats at the counter) but the sushi was a little lacking for me. We went for lunch and got the salmon platter and some other rolls. The raw salmon itself was amazing but the rolls were very small and squished and didn't taste that great. Some of the avocado was also browning already.   The kani salad (really recommend) and miso soup were great though! Another plus was the free bags of tea and hot water they had! I really loved that\n",
      "I don't particular enjoy the crowded atmosphere  but this place has a great 3 roll special to order out. It's pretty good sushi that gets the job done when you have that sushi craving.\n",
      "The sushi is amazing.  I love the sushi/ rice ratio.  my favorites are the tiger roll and the sansom roll.  It is an explosion of sushi delight in your mouth! I'll admit  it is a very small area for dining in  but they are super fast whether you're sitting at the bar or ordering out.  Personally  I like to take out.  I was addicted to it until i moved out of philly.  Now  it'll be hard finding a place as good as vic's.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been searching for a decent and affordable take out sushi place and vic's is definitely it!  The prices are great (3 rolls for $11!) and the sushi is fresh and delicious!  The place is very small and there is probably enough room to seat 8 or so.  However  if you do find a spot at the sushi bar it is BYOB.  Due to it's popularity  service is a little slow so during busy times it can take up to 40 minutes for an order so keep that in mind or try to go during off times.\n",
      "Drinking a cold Allagash after work with a co-worker at one of the outside tables  while watching the Rittenhouse crowd go by. Sharing a plate of cheese and a couple of glasses of wine at the bar with my husband. Lingering over the white bean appetizer  or gorgeous salad. Indulging in a warm chocolate dessert.   Why did I leave Philadelphia? Tria  I miss you.\n",
      "This is a GREAT wine bar in the Rittenhouse area. I think they have other locations  but since I lived a block away  I always stuck to this one. The wine list has something for everyone  and the service is pretty good (even when it is crazy crowded - which it often is!). It doesn't look like much from the outside  but the inside is perfectly set up for a variety of group sizes (although I'd stay away from anything larger than 4).   The one thing I wish that Tria had was a better  or at least more varied  food menu. I know that wine and cheese go together hand in hand  but does absolutely everything on the menu have to have cheese in it?\n",
      "Fantastic wine bar with an assortment of small plates  salads and sandwiches that will satisfy any palate. The wines and beers are expertly selected and the staff is very knowledgable. I recommend the Tulocay Cabernet Sauvignon pared with the assorted meat platter and a side of the 2 year old Gouda cheese.\n",
      "Chic  unpretentious  and yummy cheeses  wines :) Very friendly staff  very helpful and all round a wonderful experience.\n",

      "My husband and I had been walking around for so long as we argued where to eat and what to eat that eventually it was past 10pm and most restaurants started closing up.  We walked around a full hour more  and after 11pm restaurants were definitely done.  Sulking and annoyed with each other  we headed back to our hotel with empty bellies.  We decided to walk up a street that we hadn't yet been on  and came across Tria.  A server was bringing food out to the one outdoor table  and I was so hungry and cranky I think I just blurted out to my husband as I grabbed his arm \\this is a cheese restaurant and they are still serving and we are eating here!\\\"  Later we couldn't actually figure out what made me call it a cheese restaurant - they must just do a good job of conveying what they're all about.  We walked in and they were indeed still serving  and thank god there were exactly two seats remaining at their bar (still a half-hour wait for a table  despite being after 11pm).  So I already felt a love for this place because I was so hungry and I was ever thankful that I could get a decent plate of food at 11:30 at night.  But beyond this simple appreciation  everything was great.  Cured meats + salty cheeses + great  wine + shortbread cookies = yum.  This kind of meal is just my thing  and perfect for a late night nosh.  And the service kicked ass - god it made me wish that the local tapas place in my hometown could trade staff with Tria!  We were greeted enthusiastically at the door and put on the wait list.  We stood at the only empty space at the bar for a few moments and someone nearly instantly appeared with bar stools for us.  Menus and waters came quickly  and we placed our drink orders.  I got my wine right away  and in what only seemed like a few minutes later  my husband got his coffee and was informed that it was on the house because it took so long.  Just as I was about to get up to inform the host that she could take us off the wait list because we were comfy at the bar  she came up to us to ask if we still would like a table.  Even though the place was beyond packed  food came out fast and the bartender was perfectly attentive.  Everyone was just totally in synch and the service was seemless.    It's funny how sometimes it's easy to not notice when everything clicks - things that go wrong stand out so much more.  But this was one of those meals that at the end of the night you realize it was excellent in its subtle delivery of everything you wanted.  Tria saved my belly from being angry and my husband and I from having a huge fight.  Instead we had a delicious meal and a great night  and yet another restaurant on our must-visit list for when we're in the Philadelphia area.\"\n",
      "A hidden gem for lunch!! Delicious food  elegant atmosphere and very reasonable prices.  Perfect place to meet someone for lunch in center city.\n",
      "If six stars were possible  I'd given them 7.  First  the warmest most responsive staff possible. Ever waiter and waitress seemed to engage us  asking if we needed anything more  enjoyed what we'd had.  Very nice.  Wonderful wine list  varied in pricing  varietal  region and offered us a taste to help us pick what we wanted.  But as good as this was....the food was awesome.  The  lamb sausage lying in a sauce of feta  olive oil  lemon and mint and with giant white beans scattered in the sauce was absolutely amazing  enough so that now that we are back in Santa Fe we plan to try to recreate it at home. Inventive salads were as delicious as they sounded.... one with smoked duck  another with smoked chicken and another with oak-planked salmon.  All outstanding.  The various bruschetta were each yummy  too.  We came for lunch twice and almost made it back a third time (in a 3 day stay)...  It was that good.  Kudos to the staff and to a culture that obviously rewards quality in the food and staff who are engaging and warm.  Great place.\n",
      "Great place.  It's small and cozy  just very well done.  Its great for a date because the lighting makes everyone look good and they have the best wine and cheese in town (girls love that).  They also have a very nice beer selection and a bunch of fun munchies.  And if your still sober enough for desert they have the best banana  caramel and Mascarpone panini (yum!).\n",
      "I went into Tria last night for the first time knowing what an excellent reputation it has for having excellent wine and beer lists  food and service. I was extremely satisfied with two out of three however the poor service we received was unacceptable. The wine list was impressive and I thoroughly enjoyed the three glasses of wine that I had and I was extremely impressed with the food. Tria has a very small kitchen and they are putting out excellent food in spite of that. Now onto the negative. Our server could have cared less if we were there. He became less attentitive as he became less busy. When we first came in there were a lot of people however it seemed like the dining room quickly cleared out. I am assuming that he didn't care about our party of three since we told him that only one of us  myself  would be eating and only two of us were drinking.  Long story short I had to keep flagging him down when there weren't many people in the restaurant to get basic service. I am a bartender at a popular bar in Philadelphia and I know a thing or two about service. I always overtip because I am in the service business and he missed out on that. I left 20 percent.\n",
      "Pretty simple review  because we had a pretty simple dinner: Food: 2 of us shared wild Alaskan salmon pastrami with pickled red onion and rhubarb salad and one Parma pizza. Salmon pastrami sounded interesting and delivered on taste. Really fresh and left you hungry for more. The pizza was exactly as good as everyone says. Great ingredients  perfect crust  and served at the perfect temp.  Service: Our waiter was kind  attentive  and put up with our indecisive mentality. Also  the drink menu was displayed on an iPad  which was pretty unique and memorable.  Ambiance: Perfect space with casual but refined feeling. Could be perfect for really any occasion  or just to grab a quick bite.  Bottom line: I'm definitely coming back.\n",
      "Definately the best Italian Restraunt That I have been to in Philly  Suggest that you start with the Wood grilled Octopus  that was the highlight of the evening.\n",
      "Recently dined here for a date night out- the atmosphere and ambience was beautiful and trendy. Our waiter(s) were attentive (we had multiple employees come to our table and take orders deliver food  not quite sure who was our actual server)  but service itself was slow. The entire dinner took about 2 hours. I ordered the Chicken alla Grigla and it was okay  my boyfriend ordered the rabbit and loved it. The insalata misticanza is just romaine lettuce and balsamic vinegar- don't waste your money. I ordered the palazzo malgara  nerello mascalese terre siciliane igt 2015 wine and it was absolutely amazing- definitely a great wine. Lastly- the artisinal cheese board was fabulous- I would 10 10 recommend the cheese board.\n",
      "Great food.  Good service.  My wife and I had our anniversary dinner here and really enjoyed the experience and the food.  I had the tuna steak and sausage  which was perfect.\n",
      "I went here on a business dinner with co-workers. We were a group of 5. Our waiter was VERY nice and precise when it came to taking our wine orders and explaining the menu. We ordered the antipasta portioned out for 5. It was delicious and we were all impressed. However  from there our service started to decline. I believe it was a problem in the kitchen because our waiter kept apologizing for the wait. When our food finally came out my dish felt a little luke warm like it has been sitting out for a while- I ordered the halibut with mussels. The dish came with mushrooms and some kind of sauce. I was a little full from the antipasta so I only took a couple of bites of the fish which was cooked perfectly but would have been better it is was warmer. Something on the dish was a little too salty- I think it may have been either the mussels or sauce.  All in all it was a decent experience- I'd like to go back and try again.\n",
      "Have been a fan for a long time  but haven't been there in quite a while. On a recent visit to Philly  I made my way there and was not disappointed.  Sat at the bar and my bartender was attentive and knowledgeable.  Had the marinara pizza which was excellent and the meat plate which was as good as I remembered (the mustardo honey with a mustard spice to it and artichoke makes the plate.)  I had the gnocchi for dinner and it was pretty good as well.  I still feel like the price is fair for the quality and service and I will certainly keep it in my rotations when visiting Philly again.\n",
      "My fiancé and I are new to the area and were excited to try out an Italian restaurant near us. We are also on the hunt for a wedding venue and thought this restaurant may have had potential. We were very disappointed with the quality the food. We ordered the crab gnocchi and the Francobolli Ravioli- the gnocchi was drenched in butter and salt and the crab tasted like it came from a can. As far as the ravioli it was similarly salted and each ravioli hardly had any filling. The service was perfectly fine and the atmosphere was pleasant  but the food was pricey and simply not good! We got takeout from whole foods after we left. I'd skip this place if looking for some good Italian food.\n",
      "Great appetizers  great service  great food...but two pasta dishes were just too salty: spaghetti with calamari and the bucatini.  The other food (pizza and cavatelli) were just right.  Not  sure what's up with the salt.  We've been here many times  and the place is finally more relaxed.  Or rather  the customers coming in are more relaxed.  Families were eating  people in shorts  old  young...More like an osteria.\n",
      "Pizza - pretty good Marinated veggies - really good- somewhat small stamp pasta - really good but way too small for a meal (don't get it).  Bread of course is brought to the table - AWESOME!  Waitress had a great sense of humor.  Gave one of our guys a hard time which so too funny.  Definitely would return.  If you have never tried octopus  this is the place to get it.  It was really good and tender.\n",
      "I finally made it to Osteria after four years of living in Philadelphia.  I would not say that it is the best pizza in Philly . . . I will say that it is a fantastic dining experience.  I love the space  and I love the noise and bustling on a Saturday night.    It has been a long time since I've eaten in a restaurant in Philadelphia where I've literally wanted to try every item on the menu.  I was so overwhelmed by the amazing menu selections  so we will have to go back so I can try the things we missed.  We started with the lombarda pizza which was actually my least favorite of the dishes we tried  hence Osteria not having the best pizza in Philly.  We moved from the pizza to the wood-grilled octopus  which was delicious  and cooked perfectly.  For the entree  I got the canestri with braised short ribs.  This dish was perfection.  I would recommend that anyone dining at Osteria try this.  I wanted to order a second order of it . . . but opted for dessert instead.    What really makes this place special  however  and merits a paragraph of its own is the service.  I have NEVER experienced such wonderful service in all my dining in Philadelphia.  The service was such a step above other places  that I felt like the bulk of our dinner conversation focused on just how excellent the service was.\n",

      "You should always order the Jamon Iberico De Bellota.  It's stupidly expensive  but there is a reason that you pay for this melt in you mouth pork.  Razor thin slices of fatty  acorn fed pork are to die for.  If I was filthy rich  you bet your ass that I have a trained staff member slicing this stuff off for me on the daily.    The Paella was very good.  A nice crunch on the bottom of the rice  very flavorful.  One of the better paellas that I've had.  Diver Scallops were cooked perfectly.  They were light and tasty.    The wine was as terrific as expected.  Spanish wine is some of my absolute favorite.  They gave us complimentary champagne for our anniversary.  That was nice of them.  There needs to be a casual tapas restaurant in Philly.  The food here is great  but it's too expensive and too stuffy to really be tapas.  That being said  I'd absolutely recommend it.\n",
      "I have been here several times and still enjoy my meal each time I eat here. The food is great and you can almost always get a table with little to no waiting time. It is really hard to make a bad order from their menu and there is plenty to choose from. It can get pricey  I have done the chef's tasting once but once you know the menu it can actually be a somewhat affordable and delicious meal!\n",
      "a really great place and atmosphere in Philadelphia. there are a lot of great food places in NYC and this place although is in philly  its up to par compared to places with NYC. all the tapas were great and so was the sangria. great place. will definitely come back again\n",
      "This is a great place with excellent wines and very high-end tapas.  The anchovies dish in particular was so carefully executed and special  we loved it.  Some might say its a little dark inside but very masculine  warm and intimate which is clearly the ambiance they're going for.    I can't help but feel like the place was just a smeck overpriced  hence the 4 stars  but we will very likely be back here when next in Philly.\n",
      "Great food  great wine  great atmosphere! Perfect spot for a date.  4-5 dishes are more than enough for a party of two  some of my favorites are: chicken brochetas meatballs duck\n",
      "What an experience! An excellent selection of tapas  that provided one of the finest evenings of dining I have had in a while. Started with cocktails  and a mixto charcuterie and added in beets  Brussels sprouts  pork belly  smoked octopus  and finished with a mixto cheese plate as well. A fine red wine recommended by our waiter made the evening very enjoyable. Highly recommended and will be on the list for future visits.\n",
      "Great creative food  good drinks.  Great service.  One of my regular stops.\n",
      "Very classy. Each and every tapa looks and tastes like a work of [culinary] art. Obviously portions are tiny and the place is on the expensive side  but very nice overall  especially for a date or a special occasion.\n",
      "I love this place! For anyone trying out this type of cuisine for the first time  I strongly recommend it. I feel like the restaurant strikes a perfect balance between purely Spanish food and \\regular\\\" food. The restaurant is beautiful and romantic even though some of the tables have pretty stiff and high up chairs that may be uncomfortable for some. The waiters are incredibly friendly  and they make wonderful suggestions for first-timers.  Definitely get the: Chestnut soup Duck confit Scottish salmon Kobe beef Bomba rice  Definitely a must! It has become one of my favorite restaurants in Philadelphia. I would suggest not going during Restaurant Week because the menu doesn't always include some of Tinto's best then.\"\n",
      "It's been years since I've been to Valanni  but a recent happy hour brought me back for my epic return.  I have to concur with everyone who speaks so highly of their happy hour. From 5-7 Monday through Friday  they have an excellent offering of half price tapas  cocktails and wines. They also have $5 you-call-its and $3 Yuenglings.  The half off cocktails are the really special part about this special. It's not limited to a select few options. You have your choice of any of their fabulous libations. The cucumber martini was beverage of the evening. It consisted of cucumber infused Skyy Vodka  St. Germain  and fresh lime juice with a cucumber wheel. They went down smoothly and quickly. We sat at the bar and the server was on top of his game. It was very easy to place a refill order.   I also went with the spicy pulled chicken empanadas and crispy Brussel sprouts. This was definitely the most interesting preparation of Brussel sprouts I've ever eaten. They were prepared with marcona almonds  granny smith apples and aged balsamic. It truly was a tapa so don't except your typical Brussel sprout appetizer portion.   The chicken empanadas were simply out of this world. Although they were fried  they weren't the least bit greasy. There was a crispness to the shell  but it was still easy to neatly cut them with a fork and a knife. They were stuffed full of cilantro and manchego flavor and the chipotle-horseradish aioli gave a nice kick without being overly spicy. They were larger than I thought they'd be and two came to the order.  The bar area was not packed on the night of my visit and it was very easy to maintain a conversation with the three people in the group sitting at the bar without having to scream.  My tab ran me a little under $30 before tax and tip. It was nice to have quality food and cocktail in a nice atmosphere without spending a fortune.   I have no doubt there'll be less of a gap before my next visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wonderful experience!  When we walked in my first thought was \\wow  it's swanky.  Swanky places usually have food that's just ok because they are more into the atmosphere and having a cool bar than they are the food.\\\"  I was wrong.  The food was delicious!    The bar area was very vibrant and was packed. We decided to have a few drinks in before dinner and their specialty drink menu had a lot of interesting options. The print on the drink menu is really small though and it's pretty dark in there so I could barely read the ingredients. I'm in my early 30's and no where near the point where I have a hard time reading small print.  Its just hard to get a good light on the menu to read it. You can read the names of the drinks but the ingredients are tiny.  I get sick every time I drink vodka and asked the bartender if he could make one of their signature drinks with rum instead.  He said that it would taste funny if he did that but he would whip me something special instead.  Whatever it was  it was really good!      We were seated at a tiny round table for two on the lounge side. It was cozy and nice  but the table was about as big as an Altoid. I was surprised they had such small tables for a tapas restaurant.  We ordered a few different dishes and asked the waiter to space them out so that we would have room for them on the table and he was very accommodating about how much food to order and what order to serve it in.  We ordered the Medi-Latin plate  which is served on a long skinny platter that hung off both sides of the table.  Everything on the platter was delicious - far better than I would have imagined.   We also got the lobster and crab mac and cheese and it had an entire lobster claw in it plus tons of crab meat.  The sauce was pretty typical for mac and cheese - nothing amazing  but the amount of lobster and crab made up for it.   The flatbread was a good but a little lame compared to the rest of the food- I wish we had skipped that and ordered something else instead. It was tasty  just difficult to eat since the toppings didn't stay on the bread.   We split the oreo dessert and the hazelnut mouse truffle.  Both were scrumptious.  Pricing is not available on their website but it was very reasonable.  I believe the Medi-Latin plate was $25 and it included 7 different items (mostly 2 of each item  except calamari and feta which had more).  With a few drinks  the Medi Plate  Mac and Cheese  Flatbread  Polenta  and two desserts  our bill came to about $110.  We had closed out our bar tab before being seated and I believe that was about $30 for two mixed drinks and a beer.   Can't wait to go back!\"\n",
      "I've been in and out of Valanni twice before I sat down to enjoy a meal during CC Restaurant Week. The hostesses have been not so friendly and I honestly feel more comfortable walking into Barclay Prime than this place. Luckily our waitress was much nicer than the hostess. Myself and two friends had a reservation for 7:30 on a Wednesday.  I started with the Spicy Pulled Chicken Empanadas  had the Pan Seared Chicken Saltimbocca as my entree  and the Oreo Beignet for dessert. The empanadas and beignet were delicious  the chicken saltimbocca was fine.  I also had a taste of the goat cheese balls and brussel sprouts which were good too! I would definitely come back to try more in the future.\n",
      "We went for dinner on a weeknight and were pleasantly surprised by the interesting selection of smaller plates.    We knew that we definitely wanted their Crispy Brussels Sprouts (my friend usually hates them but tried them here once before and was stunned that she loved them).  The combination of granny smith apples and marcona almonds was great! And I really enjoyed the sauce that complimented - it was aged balsamic when I inquired.  Highly recommend it!  The Porkbelly Slider Cubans were pretty good too.  Simple but excellent execution and great proportions - you got just enough pickle to the Canadian bacon and cheese.    Don't skip the Fried Goat Cheese!! By far the best menu item we tried.  (See posted picture- we couldn't even resist eating one each before taking a picture of the last one on the plate). The honey just goes so well with the tangy yet creamy goat cheese  but the bell pepper marmalade adds another exciting layer for your taste buds.  Heavenly!  Service was good  although we were literally the only customers sitting outside on a nice summery night.  And don't forget to check in on yelp for a complimentary wine/sangria (if they still have that offer)!\n",
      "Very loud. Slow apathetic service. I had the pasta special  which was overcooked and lacking in any  flavor but salt. Took a long time to get our drinks even though the restaurant was not full and we did not order craft cocktails. Wine  Grey Goose on the rocks. On a positive note  my husband had a wonderful hamburger. Being an expert on hamburgers  he pronounced it one of the best he's had. We won't be back.\n",
      "A gal pal roped me in for dinner at Valanni for restaurant week.  We had an 8:30 PM reservation and the house was packed to the brim.  I always view it is a good omen when a dining room is full with patrons and I was eager to try their diverse menu.  Long story  short  I liked the food enough that I would return during a regular week.  Although I wasn't particularly fond of the grilled romaine salad (the chipotle caesar dressing was a bit too rich and more than a bit too bland)  I was infatuated with the crisp polenta croutons.  The red mussels were an instant hit at the table--they could simply serve the savory tomato garlic broth as a lone dish.  My friend gave her hard-earned approval to the Kobe beef burger (\\A-grade\\\")  which is a big deal in our social circle because she is a burger connoisseur and has been very disappointed lately with the Philadelphia burger scene.  I myself ordered the seafood paella  which was not as authentic as I had preferred (served on a white plate  no burnt rice?  an overwhelming tomato base)  but I still scarfed it down.  Even though it wasn't true paella (more of a seafood and tomato risotto)  it was generously prepared with plenty of seafood (mussels  shrimp  scallops!  clams  even a sad baby octopus) and seasoned rice.  Apparently  the house chocolate mousse hits the nervous system like cocaine and it was lapped up by all those who ordered it for dessert.  Parking was a gigantic pain in the ass  but I'm planning to come back soon for the rest of the menu.\"\n",
      "Valanni just underwent a sort of face-lift  and seems to be having a bit of an identity crisis as a result. Most people I've spoken to know Valanni as an upscale restaurant with a sleek  modern but classy set-up. The new Valanni (or \\Valanni Social\\\"  as the new signs indicate) is more of an upscale gay club/tapas bar. While there are still tables for dinner and such  the main draw now seems to be to the plush front room that faces Spruce Street  with white couches and a fancy changing-light wall. It also appears that there's a DJ there full-time pumping dance remixes into the restaurant.   You won't find Valanni on any list of gay bars in Philadelphia but it's definitely become that -- moreso a place where you and friends can go for some moderately-priced cocktails before hitting up bars like Woody's or Tavern on Camac. I also can't really tell what the server situation is there. Some people seem to get waited on in the lounge area  others not.\"\n",
      "A great standby in Center City. Went in at 6:30 PM after driving past two different venues (Marcato and Mixto) with waiting lines resembling an old Soviet bread line. We got al fresco seating with no wait and ordered several tapas. The ham croquettes were delicious. We followed that with pulled pork empanadas and a very tasty sea bass dish with crab  olive and capers.  More tapas that included roast pork with garlic  an iberian cheese plate and calamari.  We left stuffed.  Good wine selection.  The wait staff was friendly and prompt.\n",
      "I came here for the last night of restaurant week and they were swamped. We arrived 15 minutes late for our reservation because of traffic but they sat us right away with no problems. Our server was great. She was attentive even having at least 7 tables. Food was delicious not one thing tasted bad from appetizer to dessert! Only negative I could say is the seating is weird definitely a lounge atmosphere even during dinner hours  very close to the other tables. Great place!!\n",
      "Stopped in for an early lunch while visiting nearby museums. Food was pretty good (eggs Benedict with crab cake)  service was mostly good  and decor was really neat.  However  until a few more people showed  the staff had the music cranked up to late night club levels  including a couple of grating selections that set our teeth on edge and had us considering bolting out of the door.\n",
      "Atmosphere - Typical upscale bar. No televisions which I liked as a nice change of pace.   Service - Perfect. No complaints. I really did appreciate how great each person of the staff was. Greeted with a smile  super patient server. Service itself was 5/5  Food - Good. Not great.   Plantain Chips and Guacamole - Good. Not great. 4/5 Brussels Sprouts - Not really my thing  but our party of four decided to try it. 3/5 Pan-Seared Crab Cake with Roasted Pepper Aioli - I've had better. Very average. Sauce was okay. 3/5 National Burger - I liked that you could add items. My wife added avocado. I took two bites. I was very disappointed. 2/5  Drinks - Saved the day. Great drink menu and seasonal selection.   Overall - I would not go back for the food. However  if we were just getting drinks and appetizers  I'd be okay knowing that they have great service and a great drink menu. I would not come back for a meal  however.   Points for:Service and drinks.  No points: Food\n",
      "Went and had dinner with a group. Six of us were seated promptly. The food was great  simple and filling. The building and surrounding are really cool. Historic  quirky  warm and inviting.   Our server  Zack was quick and efficient. More importantly he was personable and funny. I'd recommend asking for him.   Will visit again next time I'm in town visiting family.\n",
      "\n",
      "We stopped at National Mechanics after dinner on a Friday night.  The building was cool  outside and in.  Their drink specials and variety were solid.  The DJ was playing a sweet mix of indie and 80s dance music.  There were too many people in plaid flannel shirts for my liking  but it wasn't that hard to push them out of the way and order my libation.  Overall  a less-lame spot to party in Old City.\n",
      "I have to be honest  this is the worst bar I've been to. It's not dirty or anything and I didn't try the food  however  that doesn't excuse how terrible everything else is.  The drinks were watered down and EXPENSIVE. We spent over $60  for two  for only a few drinks that hardly tasted like there was any alcohol in them at all. It was outrageously ridiculous. Not to mention every glass was filled to the brim with ice. The music was everything I could easily listen to on the radio - nothing worth dancing to. And there are two unisex bathrooms with lines that take at least 30 mins on a weekend.  Point blank  I can drink at home and have more fun. Disappointed and don't see why I'd want to go back.\n",
      "Before Sixers game we thought we'd do some bar hopping in the city. This place was fun. We're on the old side  for the patrons we saw inside  but still enjoyed immensely. Our young bartender was very friendly  even though a shaken martini seemed a little out of character for the establishment  she did it perfect. The other young server waiting on the tables had tattoos on just about every area visible  but just added to the enjoyment of that culture today. Would recommend it on your bar hopping tour.\n",
      "Good bar food  great drinks  and good music for a casual night of dancing! It can get pretty crowded on weeknights  so not meant for you if you're claustrophobic. I loved the mac and cheese!\n",
      "Delicious food  we ordered the mezcal wings  the ratatouille  the crab cakes  and a Gelato dessert.  The food and cocktails were outstanding  as was the service.  The restaurant has a great vibe  the only negative is that it is a little loud (reason for 4 stars). Would definitely recommend! The restaurant seems to be in an old church and decoration is pretty unique  fun place and fun staff!\n",
      "Great wings  friendly staff  and off the tourists radar.  If you are in old city and in need of a drink or a quick meal  stop here you will find something that you like.  Did I mention that the wings are great?\n",
      "\n",
      "Decent casual food parading itself as fine dining. Moshulu is a novelty restaurant with a nice atmosphere for folks not interested in challenging cuisine.   We started with the calimari and shrimp cocktail. The calamari were well-executed  but very lackluster in flavors. The taste was primarily of bread crumbs. The balance of flavors in the dish was off.   The shrimp cocktail came with massive shrimp  but they were particularly flavorful or well-executed. They tasted like they'd sat around cooked since the morning. The cocktail sauce was an interesting blend of cranberry and chili sauce that I did find unique and pleasant  albeit outshined by the lack of flavor in the shrimp.   My main course  the swordfish topped with short rib  sounded awesome. Alas  it was not. The swordfish was over-executed by 15-20 degrees leaving it dry and unpleasantly fibrous and sticky to the tooth on the bite. The short rib  likewise  was overcooked and dry and stringy with very little of the unctuous juicy fat that characterizes a well-executed version of the cut.   For dessert we ordered the Ice Cream Brownie for two. The ice cream and whipped cream atop were pleasantly smooth and sugary. However  the brownie was dry and chalky. Very unpleasant.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went here for dinner in December---the food was average (the pre-dinner bread was memorably bad)  my filet mignon was very salty  but our after dinner coffee was delicious.  We ate on a slant which was the only thing that reminded me we were on a boat and not just a musty Charlie Brown's.\n",
      "Our food server was very gracious  but the food and drinks were less than expected. The calamari was too salty and the PLT bread tasted like it was thrown together without any meaningful tasteful purpose. My dirty martini tasted more like olive juice. On the upside  the salmon entry was tasty. It was simply too expensive for the quality of food.\n",
      "Going to Moshulu is a delicious and unique experience.  The food was excellent. I started with the Tuna Crab Roll which was pretty good  but not nearly the star of the show. For my entree I chose the All-Natural Fried Chicken. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the grits were well seasoned. I finished the meal by trying a few desserts  including the Chocolate Luxe Layer Cake and the Moshulu Signature Sundae  which were both fantastic.  The atmosphere has some pros and cons. The ship is beautiful and (if seated in the right spot) provides some nice views. However  we sat at a table toward the middle of the ship  and we were slanted on an incline  which was a bit uncomfortable. The service was friendly and attentive  and while the food is delicious  it's a bit overpriced.  Moshulu is a great choice for a special occasion and some great food.\n",
      "The setting on the Delaware River is nice  but that is all there is to recommend this restaurant.  The restaurant décor is dated.  The menu is pretentious.  The meals were nothing special.  The hostess had an attitude.  My wife and I were placed at a table that should not have been used.  We were in a room with a party of 30  who were celebrating a 50th anniversary.  They were extremely loud and it essentially ruined our night out.  Our server did acknowledge the situation and comp'd our drinks  so nice job by him.\n",
      "Went here for a special anniversary. Food was great  service was great. Was pricey but well worth it.\n",

      "Came for dinner around 7:30 on a Saturday night and were seated fairly quickly inside. Outside seating would have been a 45 min wait. It's pretty dim  but the hanging lights are great. It was also very loud between the music and tables are pretty close together  which made it a little hard to have a conversation. It's definitely a laid back  fun atmosphere. All the serves and hostess were dressed in casual clothes.   I'm not usually into margaritas so I can't say if it the strawberry margarita was fully up to par  but I liked it.   We were given chips and two types of salsa to start. The salsas were alright.  The Costillitas-bbq pork ribs- were hands down my favorite part of the meal. Meat came right off the bone  super tender and really delicious with pineapple salsa and a little jalapeno for a sweet and spicy bite.  Enchiladas were good and Cabrito-slow cooked goat- was also very tender and tasted good with the pickled red onions  refried beans and rice.   Tres Leches Creme Brulee was okay  a little lacking in texture.  There is also a vegetarian option for dessert as well.   Server was on top of everything throughout the night. I would come back for a casual meal or drinks at the bar and play tunes on the jukebox.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love  and hate this place. It's a very toxic relationship.  Their drink list is fabulous! both the mango and blood orange margarita are made perfectly (get a whole pitcher) I think they're just as good as El vez. They also have tecate which is one of my favorite Mexican beers.  The food is always good when I go  spot on guacamole and excellent burritos! But  the servers are SO slow. Avoid Cantina if your very hungry because its quite a wait for your food  but worth it when it comes. Beware- It can get  VERY crowded here  very hipster-ish.\n",
      "Didn't have the food so can't rate it full five  but the guava margarita was superb. The patio was a little breezy haven for an afternoon drink. My friend also loved her nachos. Definitely would return for more margaritas. My Paloma fresca was just ok  though!\n",
      "First  nice things. Happy hour margaritas cannot be beat. Cheap  and they do the trick plus the service has never been anything but awesome. Now my issue is with the food. It stinks  it's too expensive  and it's made myself and countless of my friend sick.   I guess if you like hanging out on a crowded sidewalk so people can see you while you eat  this place is for you. If you like good mexican food  just go across the street to El Zarape. That place is BANGIN.\n",
      "I moved out to the east coast some months ago and have noticed that the Mexican food is very much not the authentic Mexican food I have been blessed with in the Rocky Mountain region and west coast of the nation. I would say that if you are looking for the authentic Mexican dish  this is not your place and keep going a few blocks up the street on Passyunk to find your more authentic  less aesthetically pleasing set of restaurants. This place is fun and has a fun more American style Mexican food menu.\n"

      "The last time I ate here  I was with my best friend. We wanted to sit outside  but it was too crowded  so they sat us inside. We were the ONLY table inside  and we didn't receive a menu or water or chips for almost 25 minutes. When we finally got these things  we ordered drinks that also took about 20 minutes to arrive. We were pretty annoyed  and then  as we were eating our chips  waiting to order food (still)  there was a large chunk of beef in our chips! As a vegetarian  this was a real bummer for me. I had to send the chips back and get new ones. We got our food  it was pretty okay  but the service was so bad  we barely left a tip. I hate doing that  considering I've worked in the industry before  and tips were how I made a living. But I worked really hard to earn it. This is not my first time receiving terrible service here.\n",
      "I never remember anything I order from here (although I never have a bad experience) but OMG the salsa verde. My man and I have been slowly tweaking our homemade formula to match this as closely as possible. Could seriously sit in here and just eat the chips and green salsa  it's soooo good.   Nice neighborhood bar/restaurant. Frequently very crowded and noisy (so could be a plus or minus  depending on who you are). Solid.\n",
      "These folks won't get our business again. We are new to the neighborhood. Subletting for a month. Called to order take out. On hold for 5 minutes then they hang up on me. So I walked there to place the order.  Told the bartender he hung up on me. \\Well  it has been sort of crazy around here\\\". Then a couple minutes later a murmured apology. It took 20 minutes to get the food. OK. Then I looked at the bill. $41 for a burrito  fish tacos and guacamole and chips!  There is a excellent national chain chain where $41 would be 4 dinners. It wasn't $41 good.\"\n",
      "Alright. I called and asked about operating hours and the girl on the phone was so sweet and offered to make a reservation for us! Already better service than any other restaurant.   Upon walking in the restaurant was beautiful. Bar was amazing. The whole vibe was raw and warm at the same time.   We go upstairs and two servers took care of us. Not rushed. Casual but polite. Our server gave us a ran down and he was legitimately a really cool guy.   We ordered  DanDan Noodles- these were good. Every place has their spin on it. These were tossed table side. I would say it was heavy on the peanut flavor and the noodles weren't as \\bite to the tooth\\\" or \\\"al dente\\\" as I personally like. Still good. HUGE portions.   Sichuan Cold Noodles- I am just a cold noodle fan. I like cold noodles in general. These were great! Loved the Sichuan chili oil sauce. Great crunch. Just delicious.   Scallion Pancakes- very Taiwanese. These were the epitome of Taiwanese pancakes.   Pork braised rice bowl. This was $1.95. Yup. In a regular bowl. It was so inexpensive and so good. The pork belly was tender and soft and everything you can dream of.   Garlic Pork- I love myself pork belly. I must try garlic pork everywhere I go. This is the dish that allows me to see if I like the place or not. It was delicious here. Great garlic flavor. The sauce was done right.   Wonton in Chili Oil- delicious! Top 3 wontons. The sauce was perfect. Hints of vinegar. The wontons had good filling. Me personally would have like the skin to be a bit thicker but that's a personal preference.   Dinner for 2 was a success. Great job guys. Thank you to our server was being amazing.\"\n",
      "You must go! Except going back to cheaper  typical Chinese takeout will make your eyes rain tears of regret. Almost everything was perfect. I don't usually like Wonton Soup but i was seduced their delicate wontons and clean simple but flavorful broth. Excellent scallion pancakes  Dan Dan noodles  spring rolls  and three cup chicken (a little in the sweeter side for some). Skip the black peppercorn entree unless you like heart burn and acid reflux  huge portion w. overpowering sauce. Excellent service.\n",

      "Loved it! Had my friends bday party here. They were very compliant with our requests for lighting and cutting our cake. They had great food. We ordered the scallion pancakes  dan dan noodles and the 3 pot chicken. Was enough food for 4 people. The dan dan noodles had a spicy peanut sauce which was delicious! Definitely would go back!\n",
      "I live in NYC and was here for the opening weekend and am generally here at least twice a month.   The food is great and incredibly cheap. Minced pork over rice is $1.75....  Design wise  the place clearly didn't retain an architecture but it's generally fine and unobtrusive.   The service is great and if you go during lunch on a weekday  you may be expected to wait 15 min or so for a table. Otherwise  their table turnover is quite fast (within a couple minutes).\n",

      "I'm a huge fan of Dan Dan. There are plenty of Asian spots around the city but this is my favorite. i love the pot stickers but the best thing that I like are the noodles at happy hour for $5 they give you a delicious bowl of Dan Dan noodles big enough to share with a friend. I love that they are warm and savory going in  and then spicy in the finish. So delish! But the thing I love most is going there on Wednesday for happy hour  (4:30 - 6:30) is the bartender Nate! I've known him for years and he is a master mixologist. He can make you any drink you want and it will be perfect every time! He's very personable and always has a great story. I can eat and drink from home  but I come to Dan Dan for the excellent food  great service and the wonderful hospitality from Nate.\n",
      "This is Han Dynasty for the uninitiated  perhaps even the timid.  From the rumor mill  it's been said that this restaurant came as a result of a family feud (Han and his sister?) - and thus Dan Dan and also Han's namesake famous noodle dish came to be.  I think we can live in a city where Han Dynasty and Dan Dan can coexist.  Han Dynasty is the traditionalist  more authentic with a kick  while Dan Dan is (can I say it?)  more Americanized.    Perfect quick lunch spot in a conveniently modern space  with service to match.  Three dishes to split for two and you are more than fine  and perhaps even stuffed.    My standard: Dan Dan (duh)  bok choy  and a protein to go with (have your pick).  Can't lose.\n",

      "We were only a party of two who decided to go for a late brunch/lunch on a Tuesday.  We waited 30 minutes for a server to take our drink orders and when we said we'd like to place our food orders at the same time  she said  \\I can't do that because it's against the rules.\\\"  We proceeded to wait ANOTHER 20 minutes for her to come back to take our food orders.  I ordered the quiche and my friend the eggs benedict.  We both asked for a simple request of \\\"no additional salt added\\\" because both of us are on low sodium diets.  The server wrote it down and came back 10 minutes later saying  \\\"...for the no salt  I can't do that because I can't give specific alterations for certain food orders.\\\"  At this point  we were pretty fed up and said  \\\"It's fine.  Please just bring our check when the food arrives.\\\"  The food came out in yet another 25 minutes.  My food was watery and my friend's benedict was SO undercooked that the eggs turned to liquid when she cut into them.  The cook didn't bother to drain the potatoes and vegetables so her dish came out literally sitting in a puddle of greasy  watery liquid.  Future diners  keep in mind that this is a chain and the people who make the food are just cooks.  Don't order anything that requires culinary finesse and if you are used to truly fine cuisine  lower your expectations to 'zero.'\"\n",

      "This is my FAVORITE breakfast spot in Philadelphia  PA! The portions are huge and tasty. I went there yesterday with my new bride. We let the server know that we were newly married & they comped us free Lattes. Each time I've been there the food has gotten better. Yesterday I ordered the Eggs Benedict Short Braised Ribs. It was succulent & probably the best meal I've ever had. Also had the Peanut Butter Latte & it tastes just like it sounds. The place is cash only & totally worth it. The Red Velvet Pancakes are the most amazing creation this side of the Mississippi! Can't wait to go back! I recommend Green Eggs to any local or tourist visiting the City. If I could give more stars I would!!!!\n",

      "So hear me out! I LOVE THE FOOD HERE! The food has always been great! Full of flavor and rich in texture. The presentation is consistent and the ambiance is decent.  Problem 1: the wait time is horrendous! I'm a regular every Saturday around noon  and although it's expected to be busy they really should strongly consider EXPANDING! Some times the wait is a huge turn off. Parking is horrific as well. It's the luck of the draw.   Problem 2: the people running the place aren't that friendly. It's like the mafia  speak when spoken to type of interaction. I don't get an overwhelmingly friendly vibe from any of the staff.   Problem 3: this is primarily why I give only 2 stars. Often when I go to this restaurant I bring about 4 to 5 people with me. We're usually sat at the front by the door. It's their only long table. What I don't appreciate is that when its time to pay the bill the manager and or door boy guards the front door as if we are going to run out on the bill. And these are people of color that stand guard. It's disheartening and offensive. It happens every time like clock work. Except for when there's a group of Caucasian individuals sitting there. Gotta do better Green Eggs!   Problem 4: cash only is annoying! I would much rather swipe my card. I don't carry cash on me in the city for OBVIOUS reasons.\n",
      "Always great. I've been here a few times and my favorite has to be the red velvet pancakes. Delicious. The portions are massive  and could easily be three meals. It gets crowded fast so I would suggest getting there as they open or trying to go on a weekday.\n",
      "If you are getting brunch at Green Eggs  it is not because you were strolling by. It's because you planned it. The line can be quite intimidating and you can easily expect a 30-45 minute wait.   That said. I would wait well over and hour to eat here. Once you get past the wait  you are in a state of euphoria and bliss. I have never been disappointed in my experience at this establishment.  As with most restaurants in Philly  you can expect a fresh hot cup of La Colombe coffee straight away. Then you need to make the impossible decision between sweet and savory. Me  I always choose both.  The general plan is for everyone to get a savory dish and then we put a sweet dish in the middle to share. Short Ribs Benedict is my personal favorite!!!  For the sweet side  I highly recommend the Apple Pie French Toast or the Red Velvet pancakes.   Most importantly  as a side for your meal  break out the big bucks and spend the extra $1 on the grits. They'll even sprinkle some scrapple flakes on top. A definite win for the customer!  I love this place and will return.   BE AWARE. THIS IS CASH ONLY AND THE BILL WILL BE MORE THAN $20. Generally  each meal is around $15. Bring enough with you. Even so  they have an ATM with a low surcharge at $.99.\n",
      "Service was great  LOVE the pecan pie French toast  scrapple and eggs  and red velvet pancakes. Only takes cash but they tell you at beginning and show you were the atm is  huge portions so plan on taking some home.\n",

      "This update (and upgrade) to my review of Khyber is long overdue!  I think the most ringing summary is that I have since moved ~1 mile further away from the Khyber  and I still go there just as often.  I have now sampled most of the menu  but the truly excellent Southern barbecue is what usually calls to me.  You can't go wrong whether you pick the brisket  the ribs  the chicken  the pulled pork or a combo of the above.  Their mac and cheese remains my favorite side  and the addition of the very good coleslaw rounds out the experience.  I love the vibe of Kyber.  It usually pretty full  but they usually seem to have a table available for me (Yay!).  It is often loud  but never quite so loud that I wish it were quieter.  The staff is very knowledgeable  and happy to provide beer recommendations and taste tests of drafts.  They Khyber also manages to hit that sweet spot where I never end up being the most or least intoxicated person there!\n",
      "\n",
      "I absolutely love Khyber! Low-key atmosphere  reasonable prices  and fabulous food. Their pulled pork sandwich is amazing. They also make a mean cocktail. Would absolutely recommend it  and can't wait to go back!\n",
      "My dad and I came to Philadelphia for a night from NYC to sight see. We got in around 5 and were pretty hungry  so we went to look for a place with good food that wasn't too touristy. We stumbled across this place and decided to give it a shot. We sat in the restaurant area since I'm underage  but I liked the atmosphere. Our waitress was really nice as well.  My dad liked the beer and I liked the food. I got the pulled pork sandwich with collard greens. The portions were huge. I've never had barbeque made with vinegar sauce but I really liked it. For dessert  I ordered the Red Velvet Cupcake. Now  I'm from Southern California and I have tried red velvet before  but I couldn't understand what the fuss was about. I decided to give it another try since I was on the east coast. Best. Decision. Ever. I finally understood what Red Velvet is supposed to taste like. It was delicious! I felt like my sight had been restored and I could finally see what I had been missing out on.  I was surprised to find such a great place so close to our hotel. I wish we could have stayed here longer so I could have tried more of the menu.\n",
      "Been here twice in the past 2 years and both times the food was excellent! Roast beef sandwich - A+. Fried oysters - A+. Grilled chipotle-bourbon Wings - A+. This is far more than typical bar food. Most recent visit was 11 26. After our meal we asked for a couple of Jaegers and the manager(?) suggested an alternative. I wish I could remember what it was called. It was delicious AND he gave it to us on the house! Great food   great service  great location!!\n",
      "Nice atmosphere  good place to have dinner or drinks with a few friends. Vegan pulled 'pork' was not superb but pretty OK\n",
      "There are few truly great lunch places in Old CIty Philadelphia - if you are looking for a sandwich this probably the best.  The pulled pork is absolutely amazing  servers and beer list well informed  and sides worth being a main attraction all their own.\n",
      "Service here was quick and friendly but it was really slow while I was there so who knows if it's always that quick. The menu caters to everyone - vegans  vegetarians  and carnivores. I don't recall any gluten free options but don't quote me on that. The atmosphere is okay but they had way more seating than I expected from the entrance. I ordered the vegan sausage sandwich and I thought it was pretty good. I would probably go back at some point.\n",
      "I like this place & will probably be back just for the bacon greased popcorn. Great beer too. Girlfriend and I stopped by for lunch one day and ordered the fried chicken and the duck sandwich. The duck was a solid dish. The chicken  however  is what drops this from 4 to 3 stars. Skimpy pieces of chicken with not a ton of flavor. Nice  crispy skin though. Mac n cheese was average. Bacon grease popcorn was the star.\n",
      "Somehow was able to get a seat at the bar on a Friday night (only because people were leaving the bar and I swiped their seats).  Otherwise  it would have been a good 60-90 minutes for a seat.  I ordered some of their rosemary flatbread for starters  which was delicious.  It came out hot and freshly made.  For dinner  I ordered the Gnocchi.  It came out soft and melted in your mouth. To die for  if you're a fan!!  If you're a pizza fan  I've heard good things about the pizza  but I didn't get a chance to try it.  Definitely a go to place if you can.  It's amazing I didn't come here when I lived in Philadelphia!\n",
      "Excellent. My boyfriend and I had a late-night visit after work the other day  and we ordered the meat cheese tray and the Stache. Both were awesome (quince jam on the meat tray!!)  and the bartender (I believe his name was Ray) makes a mean Old Fashioned. And a super friendly staff  to boot!\n",
      "I've been here twice and loved it both times!  The first time  the boyfriend and I split the polpettini pizza (mini veal meatballs) and the sausage pizza.  Both were very tasty with the perfect amount of cheese/sauce/meat ratio.  Crust was very crispy.   The second time we went  we shared the simple but delicious margherita pizza  and 2 pasta dishes.  One was parm  ramps  and speck angel hair  and the other was a bacon chorizo gnocchi of sorts.  Both pastas were amazing and I wished the dishes were bigger so I could really stuff my face!  Zavino also has a great draft beer and wine selection.  The servers are friendly and knowledgeable.  The only downside is that the place is very small so on a busy night there is a wait.  The bonus is that they have outdoor seating!  It's a must-try pizza place if you like tasty  thin  and simple pies coupled with good drinks.\n",
      "Excellent pizza and meatballs  and the bar menu is quite good as well.  Fantastic spot to sit outside and people watch.  Save $40 and walk across the street from El Vez.\n",
      "I went with my girlfriends and we ordered the garden  kennett  and the \\stache\\\" pizza  as well as the gnocchi  and the avocado salad. I loved the gnocchi and the avocado salad! They were both very delicious. The \\\"stache\\\" was more popular amongst my friends.  The service was very good. Our waitress was very attentive. It was a pleasing time here.\"\n",
      "Really great little Italian wine bar. We stopped in for a quick bite to eat - it was indeed quick to get food  but not quick to get a table. They are just too popular. However  getting on the wait list isn't a problem and they'll text you when your table is ready. No big deal.  We shared the fettuccine (tasty) and the eggplant parm (some of the best we've ever had). We also ordered a side of rosemary flatbread. The latter tasted good  but reminded me a lot of naan - not the normal texture of flatbread. So while it was good  it didn't mentally fit with what I thought I was ordering.   Service is fine  though spotty at times when it's super busy. I was super impressed that despite the rush  the manager (owner?) stopped by to say hi and see how things were.  I'd love to go back when the weather is warmer and we can enjoy a more leisurely meal outdoors. Definitely a nice little place!\n",
      "\n",
      "Packed on a recent Saturday night  my wife and I managed to squeeze into the bar on one stool!  Celine  our bartender was incredible  first making us killer \\Graveyard Shift\\\" cocktails  then tipping us when two stools were emptying at the other end of the bar so we could sit comfortably and order more food and wine.  We loved the daily board special of Bresaola  Hot (!) Capicola  and cheeses  and it was more than enough for dinner for 2. The Barbera blend we had was perfect as well. I'm not sure what some of the gripes about service are about in the reviews below but look for Celine at the bar and you'll be glad you did.\"\n",
      "Very warm ambience  a little noisy  I wasn't to fond of the television in the bar area. Pizza is really good. Nice location\n",
      "After some long hard hours of shopping  my mom and i decided that 1. we were starving and 2. we needed a drink. Thankfully Zavino was right around the corner.   We walked in and decided to sit at the bar as all the tables were taken in this teeny tiny place. We started with the sangria which I thought was very tasty. I loved the spices they used. Perfect for a fall day.   For our meal we split the stache pizza and the beet salad. Both were great. The beet salad was obviously with goat cheese and the beets had this sweetness to them that was fantastic. Next was the stache pizza which was awesome. You can really taste the wood oven in the crust which was awesome and i loved the pistachio pesto...perfect touch.\n",
      "I ate there a couple of years ago.  I still remember that it was one of the best meals I have ever had.  I had the basil shrimp  lobster pot pie  and the Martha Washington Chocolate Mousse cake.  Great salad and homemade bread too!\n",
      "\n",
      "Sat on the outside porch drinking a 19th century cocktail while someone played a harp in the courtyard. How can you not like that! Try the city cooler. Whist  brandy  rum and apple cider. Waitress called it a Party in a glass! Very tasty. Had the seafood linguine and corn chowder. Everything excellent  server included.\n",
      "Loved City Tavern! We lunched here during our day of historical sightseeing in Philadelphia. We loved the history of it  including the traditional dishes. The authentic breads were delicious  as was the local beer. It was family friendly (including kids menu)  and casual yet a nice respite from walking around the city in the heat of summer. A perfect historical landmark to check off your list while eating lunch  a good way to break up your day exploring America's oldest city. Enjoy!\n",
      "Originally built in 1773  this was the convening site for the Constitutional Convention  as well as the setting for one of George Washington's inaugural celebrations. The cuisine here is authentic early American  with many of the dishes adapted from 18th Century recipes. Veal sausage with  sauerkraut and mashed potatoes  honey-glazed duck with asparagus  and medallions of venison with leeks are among the traditional entrees served by a staff in period dress. A children's menu suggests this is an ideal place for family dining  but you may feel differently after seeing the prices.\n",
      "meh. overly priced  boring food.  service wasnt great  and the server was unenthuastic  which was a bummer  because other ppl write they learned a lot of history and i didnt.... dont go to touristy places to impress your guests.  if u wouldnt eat here normally  dont take anyone from out of town.\n",
      "\n",
      "Took some friends here last weekend who were visiting from out of town. Such a great way to continue our tour of Philadelphia and get our drink on. Didn't eat  but did enjoy a few beers. Word of advice - Get the flight. It's $7.25 for a single pint or $12 for the flight which are nice sized (larger that most flights). So the 4 of us each ordered a flight and split the cheese plate (which was fine - normal). Loved the experience (servers in colonial costumes and the general decor) and they give a great description story regarding each beer. There's also a cheat sheet with more information which was nice. My favorite was Alexander Hamilton  but honestly each of the four were tasty. Highly recommend for wrapping up an afternoon in historical Philadelphia.\n",
      "What a fabulous time my husband and I had at this restaurant on our holiday trip to Philadelphia. Did not know what to expect and was afraid it would be a cheesy tourist trap  but the experience could not have been further from that. First off  the food is good. It is really good. The craft beers were superb and the staff was fabulous. Seth  our server  was personable and efficient and really added warmth to the experience. When in philly again  we are looking forward to returning.\n",
      "I read about this place and it was certainly cute and charming as the restaurant reflected the colonial days.  To make it more charming and realistic  the servers dressed in period costume from back in the days.  I had the colonial turkey pot pie which was not a huge portion but was adequate.  It was very tasty with good ingredients and a nice gravy and crust.  It came with egg noodles with a sauce that I wasn't crazy about.  My water glass had some white things floating in it which resembled wax.  Hopefully  it wasn't something worse...  If you want to pretend you are dining way back when our forefathers did  City Tavern will give you that unique experience.\n",
      "Oh no  is Sabrina losing her touch?! My last experience at this particular location was sub-par at best. When I can't decide on a special  I always revert to one of my favorite dishes- the  Cheddar and Apple Omelet. Sadly this time around  it was lack luster. The eggs were a bit overcooked and the dish was lukewarm when it arrived. The best thing on my plate were the potatoes and onions  these are always tasty and grilled nicely. I substituted toast for an everything bagel but that was regretful. The bagel was scantly seasoned and on the stale side-- bummer :( We shared the classic Challah French toast  it didn't blow my mind but it was good. There could have been more strawberries! Aside from the food  the service was pretty good despite how busy the place was on a Sunday morning. My coffee mug was filthy which was not ideal but I understand these things happen. Tip--use the No Wait app to \\get in line\\\" so that your table is available when you arrive!\"\n",
      "Three friends and I came here for New Year's day brunch. We used the No Wait app and we were seated almost immediately. The server came by promptly after we were seated to take our drink orders. We gave her our food orders when she came back. Our food came about 40 minutes later. I got the Eggs Benedict with Canadian bacon and I was not disappointed. Portions were large  as usual  but I still wish I got more home fries.\n",
      "Amazing! Huge huge portions! Went there for brunch and sat at the bar because it was so crowded. But nonetheless I had a great time  loved the food and atmosphere. The staff are super friendly there.\n",
      "Parking is hard to find but this out of towner did it! Its all on-street. Sabrina's was easy to find and is located in a beautiful building. I actually just should have walked here  its that nice out and very pedestrian friendly. I got to sit against the rotunda wall/wall of windows. What a great spot!  I ordered a cup of coffee  the challah french toaste and a side of homies. Everything was really delicious and fresh tasting. Service was really great and quick. Just a wonderful experience.\n",
      "I love this place. I think I might be obsessed with this place because this is where I take all of my visiting friends out for brunch on saturdays. Call beforehand to get on the queue and usually when you arrive  the wait time has decreased and you'll be quickly seated. The french toast  buttermilk pancakes  and huevos rancheros are awesome. As for the the brunch specials  all of them are good but a consistent favorite of mine is the eggs benedict. This place also serves yummy burgers if you want to come here for dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazing food and fabulous service at more than affordable prices.  The Mexi Scramble is simply HEAVEN. Black bean grits and cilantro pesto are to die for... Their pineapple juice is seriously delicious also- tastes just like you're drinking straight up blended pineapple!\n",
      "My biggest issue with Sabrina's was the blandness of my food. For the positives  I liked this cafe's cute atmosphere  the music and the service. Our waiter was friendly  but he didn't know much about the different menu options. We ordered parmesan fries as an appetizer  the fries themselves were good  but I don't see why they're called 'parmesan' fries when they were barely seasoned with cheese...or salt.   I ordered the vegetarian Greek sandwich: a pita stuffed with falafel  cheese  olives and garlic hummus. Unfortunately  my sandwich came with only one very small small piece of falafel  and the rest was overloaded with hummus and olives. I was basically eating an olive sandwich half way through  even worse  it had little to no flavor. Maybe I just made a bad selection  but I won't risk wasting another 11 dollars here.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This place has the perfect name  the DEVIL. This is the worst service I ever received In life. The Waiter was horrible as she didn't serve us any water due to there not being any clean cups but offered us an alcoholic beverage instead and bring us drinks in CUPS  such a doozy. In addition she was very rude  the manager wasn't helpful either. She was so bothered that she gave us too much money back and when being honest about the exchange she tried to snatch the money out of my hand as if we calculated wrong. Im suprised such a rude person still has a job as a waitress. I would've given this place no stars but the food was good but wasn't worth the racist act. I warned you  don't let Satan get You.\n",
      "Absolutely Phenomenal!  We went here for restaurant week because we heard they had an exceptional variety of beers  and were looking for one of our favorites Ithaca Apricot Wheat. They did not disappoint on the beer front  but even better still the food was fantastic with MASSIVE portions. We decided to order one of the restaurant week meals and an order of their nachos to share.   the nachos were a huge platter piled high with guacamole and sour cream  and with the added beef brisket they did not disappoint! Absolutely a fantastic start to our meal!  The courses of their restaurant week selection that we chose were: Course1- Pulled Pork Taquitos Course2- Pear  Gorganzola  Butter Lettuce Salad Course3- Devils Classic BBQ Combo we chose the sweet potato side as well as the crab and corn potato hash. Course4- Triple layer chocolate cake.  The entire meal was amazing. With our favorite part being the ribs in the BBQ combo. The meat was falling right off the bone and was flavored to perfection. The only thing I would suggest is a different side other than the crab and corn potato hash. It definitely was not enough to completely deter us from going there again  but it was not the best thing on the menu.  I definitely highly recommend this restaurant as the atmosphere was very fun and catered to people our age. (Mid 20s) We will definitely be going back soon!\n",
      "One of my favorites in the Rittenhouse area.  Definitely worth taking the train into Suburban just for a meal at Devil's.  Good vibe all around  love the decor. Always good craft beers and at a decent price. Bloody marys are also unique: I believe they use muddled and blended chipotles in adobo sauce  v8  vodka of course  and top it off with a splash of guinness  or possibly a cream stout? Can't remember. Very tasty. But be careful  10$ a pop for most mixed drinks including mary's.   The food is excellent...thinking about the menu makes me salivate....all of it  I have not been disappointed ever. Not once.  Highest of the highlights for me:  brisket sliders  grilled wings....(hard to go back to regular fried wings)  stuffed hot dog  fries and onion rings  and the cornbread.\n",
      "Came here as a last minute resort since everywhere else was booked. The name made me skeptical  but I was hungry so it had to do. Upon entrance  the place looked like they were closing. The hostess sat us upstairs (where a handful of ppl were watch the NCAA game). The waiter gave us the menu (which were very sticky - gross!). My date kept pointing out a chicken bone that was off to the side of the floor (gross  again!). All in all  I wouldn't return again.\n",
      "I've been to DA for breakfast  lunch  happy hour and dinner and have been totally pleased every time.  Good food & service.  I'd go there anytime.\n",
      "Their cocktails are just okay...  BUT THEIR FOOD IS SO GOOD. Their veggie burger is AMAZING. It's like a chickpea  black bean mix that's lightly breaded and fried. so yum!  And for brunch  I had oreo bread pudding french toast. It was a daily special and it changed my life. I hope they repeat it!\n",
      "I base most of my out of town food choices on Yelp and its places like Devil's Alley that assure me my reliance is not misplaced.   We started with the Fried green tomatoes. To be honest  this was my first time having fired green tomatoes though I'm not sure how any other place could to better. They were perfectly fried with a delicious marinara sauce topped with yummy cheddar cheese. Wow. The dish itself isn't mind blowing  the ingredients are nothing exotic but the total combination was out of this world.   For dinner I had the dry rub wings and a side of the mac and cheese. The wings were tremendous. Expertly seasoned and cooked perfectly cooked. The mac and cheese was good - but not amazing. I'm a fan of S'Mac on NYC's lower east side where Mac and Cheese is what they do. While that may not be a good comparison  you can't argue with good food.   Overall I would defiantly go back next time I'm in Philly.\n",
      "One of the worst dining experiences I've had. Service was great  server was attentive. Ordered some drinks which tasted as if there was no alcohol in them at all considering their daily special. Appetizers came out warm  probably the worst nachos I've had. Fries were over salted. Food was overpriced considering the quality. Would not recommend this place to anyone.\n",
      "I don't have much to say about Devil's Alley other than I love it. I've been here for restaurant week  on first dates  catching up with friends  and for Valentine's Day. Always a good time! Their vegetarian options do leave much to be desired  but that might be because I can be a bit picky. I do highly recommend the fried green tomatoes though!\n",
      "A quaint cafe. Walked over with a group of friends after a comedy show at Helium. Everyone was satisfied with their food. I personally did not love the bathroom situation in the basement. Our waitress seemed to be having a rough night  and was trying to get back on track  but just couldn't. Great place  great atmosphere despite the aforementioned.\n",
      "My fiancee and I stopped here for lunch on a Saturday recently. The service was fine but the food took longer than it should have  being that we were only 1 of the 2 tables in the restaurant. Also  the noodles were under cooked to the point of being unchewable  I would try it again but was really underwhelmed by my first experience there.\n",
      "Okay --  after salivating for three weeks  staring at this baby in my bookmarks  I rounded up some members of \\the dyke crew\\\" (preemptively: no  str8s  don't ever call queer women that  thanx) and bounced over.  I have to admit  the $$ threw me off -- appetizers are between 6$ and 12$  entrees are more around 17$.  For some reason  I thought I'd be shelling out ten bucks for the main course.  After recovering from my small heart attack  we went inside and proceeded to feast.  We ordered (per Yelpers) the rock shrimp  the duck crepe and then the guac and wonton chips for we had a vegetarian.  For dinner  D had the Shanghai beef  I had the Dan Dan noodles and said veg had the ... veg-fried rice.  The rock shrimp was damn good -- not overpoweringly shrimpy  fried lightly and without grease  and the curry sauce!  You have to wrap the shrimp in the salad and dip because the mixed greens bring the plate together.  The guac was interesting (avocado in a spicy red sauce)  and the chips were as light as the shrimps' batter.  The star of the appetizer round was the Peking duck crepe.  D and I made obscene noises while the veg said it tasted too alive.  The duck is cooked perfectly  not too heavy  and it comes with hoisin sauce.  I really enjoyed my Dan Dan noodles.  I thought for a moment the portion might be too small  but all the food here is rich and sumptuous  and you get just the right amounts.  With the crumbled pork on top and the leaves of spinach  I felt like the bowl echoed a very spicy spaghetti and meat sauce.  I also snagged some of the fried rice (I'm not sure how there is such a thing as a \\\"best fried rice \\\" but this stuff qualified)  and then I tried some of the Shanghai beef.  I don't like beef.  The meat melted in my mouth  I swear to god  and comes in this weird sauce that I can best describe as Chinese BBQ/honey.  We received complimentary desserts of fried pumpkin cakes  which were nice palate cleansers.  Overall  goddamn.  Basically.\"\n",
      "Like an authentic Chinese hole in the wall- plated and served up with a classy air.  The dry chili chicken is almost as good as the oily brethren I've had in alternate Chinese houses- the staff is serviceable and efficient.  I've had a lot of trouble using any kind of yelp deal or groupon- so keep it simple?    Lunch specials reasonably priced but a few blocks north you can get some of the best Chinese for less fuss and same price or (at dinner) way less.  Clean to the sake of boring  but a decent spot for a drink.\n",
      "This place is good and I'd recommend it. Everything I've ordered had been good or very good and delivery time is always reasonable. I just ate a big bowl of udon and it was fantastic. They also make great drinks if you're eating there.   That being said...  The vegetable pad Thai was seriously the worst I've ever had in my life. It had no taste and the only vegetables were a few pieces of cabbage. Seriously? I almost called to complain it was that bad  and I don't do that. I don't even understand how it's still on the menu.\n",
      "The food is really good compared to any other Asian restaurant in town. And for the price...  It's super economical. 2 meals and an appetizer with an alcoholic drink came up to $44. What else could you ask for ?  Atmosphere is very cool. Bar is neat and stylish.  Overall great !! Go eat !\n",
      "Delivery service was fantastic! Came in 30 minutes and without damage. The Satay Chicken and the Mini Wontons were delicious. However  the fried rice was a little bland and the tofu in the Penang Curry was a weird texture. Overall a good experience  I would recommend for a new adventure.\n",
      "Awesome Asian fusion place from the decor to the food. There was plenty of staff there to greet us and help us with anything we needed. As a vegetarian they had plenty of options.   Went with a group of five people and wanted to our share meals after spending a long day out. First ordered a small hot plate as an appetizer.  Two dandan noodles were more than enough between the five of us and even after being super hungry we could only eat about one and a half. So the portion sizes are good. The taste of the noddles weren't bad  but it wasn't the best dandan either. Could've used a little bit more flavor (spiciness).   For the main entrees we orders the drunken noodles with tofu and mushrooms. This was very good  spicy  and flavorful . My favorite of the night. Lettuce wrap with tofu  which was okay in my opinion. The tofu was very hard and dry  but the lettuce did help. Tofu in black bean sauce was really good as well. It comes with rice and there's so much flavor enough that you don't even need this dish spicy.  Overall the quality of the service  food  and pricing was great.\n",
      "So yummy! Five of us had the Dan Dan noodles  some wontons  the ahi tuna dumplings (my favorite--so good)  a dry pot  the sautéed veggies  the eggplant  some black bean fish  and a panang curry. Cocktails for everyone. So yummy.  It is fair to compare Spice 28 to Han Dynasty--you get a lot of the same heat that you'd get there and there are a number of dishes both do well (like Dan Dan Noodles). The food is more \\ fusion\\\" style at Spice  and the ambiance is flashier  but the prices are pretty good and the quality is there. Not a place to be dismissed!\"\n",
      "Came here on the tail end of restaurant week because it was one of the only location that still had free reservations. Did not regret. Great food  great service  definitely underrated. 10 10 would recommend.\n",
      "The external decor of Spice 28 is rather abysmal  but the inside - with its modern  sleek look and neon lights glowing here and there - reminds me very much of Pod and Morimoto.  We arrived here for dinner on a weeknight  and it was fairly packed  so that was a good sign.  We started off with the fajitas  (interesting item to be on the menu given that Spice is an Asian restaurant) and crispy calamari.  Both dishes were good in the sense that they tasted like what I expected (but also not very hot  as if they had been sitting somewhere for a little while...).  But  they were bad in the sense that the only Asian twist to them was the traditional varieties of dipping sauce that accompanied each dish.  Not exactly very creative  and perhaps a little bit deceiving.  The waiter must had asked the kitchen to fire up our entrees before we even got our appetizers  because before we even got through half of either appetizers  our entrees came to the table.  Normally  I would have no qualms with this  because - as anyone who knows me can attest to - I eat rather fast.  But  I was trying to pace myself  and by the time I got to my entree  it was borderline lukewarm.  The food itself (chicken basil fried rice) was decent  but perhaps that's because I'm comparing it to the gold standard at Tuk Tuk  a cozy little Thai place in Long Island City that makes incredible basil and green curry fried rice.  To close off the meal  the kitchen sent out some sort of pancake on the house.  We were advised to stop talking and eat it while it was hot - so we did.  What greeted my taste buds was bland  and not what I would want to be the last impression guests have upon leaving.  Luckily  that wasn't our last impression of Spice.  We split the bill  one Amex  one Visa.  When the receipts came  it became apparent the waiter had split the bill  but charged both halves to my card.  Yay  I won!  We told the waiter of this mistake  and his response was for us to exchange cash with each other  laughed  and walked away.  There was no way I wasn't going to write a review after that!  Would I go back?  Before the check incident I would have said yes  because some of my fellow Yelpers have given it rave reviews.  After the check incident?  Probably not.  Food and service are what I look for when I go out to a sit-down  and from this experience  Spice 28 provided neither very well.\n",
      "After trying a few ramen places with crazy variety in their selections and stellar broth  I was not too excited about the ramen I got at Cheu.  Maybe it's a matter of taste  but personally  I was not a fan of their thick noodles  and extremely salty broth.    The service was great  and they had a nice selection of beers!  The friend I went with loved it  and has been many times.  Honestly  I'm just sorry I wasn't a bigger fan.  But I hope others try it for themselves.  I might just be an oddball out on this one.\n",
      "Second visit even better than the first!!  Loved the butternut squash and goat cheese Rangoons  and the delightfully filling mushroom yakisoba. Amazing flavor  and a smoky   meaty feel though it is meatless. Then came the coconut curry ramen. Heaven in a bowl.  My only complaint is when you have to wait for seating there is no way to hang by the bar without constantly feeling you are in The servers' way as they breeze by with deliciousness in bowls and plates. So worth the wait before heading to the theater. Plus  food comes out very quickly so we made the curtain  just barely  but with really happy tummies.\n",
      "I came here with a group of four and had a great experience. There are tons of interesting appetizers to try--we had dumplings with corn and mushrooms  wings  and some specials that are escaping me. Each of us also got an order of noodles. These are not chinatown noodle house portions  but they also aren't chinatown noodle house ingredients. Interesting  fresh  and tasty. Plus its a great deal and BYO to boot. Great addition to 10th street!\n",
      "Happy hour here is great! We ordered the corn rangoons  which were a nice combination of savory and sweet  and the bulgogi dumplings  along with the happy hour cocktail special. If we had stopped there  the bill would have been $24. But the dumplings were so good we had to get another order and the cocktails were so good we had to each get (ahem) two more. And the food in general was so delicious that we wanted to try some entrees. The brisket ramen noodles were perfectly cooked and the meat was very tender. The shrimp dan dan noodles were peanutty and creamy. Service was very attentive and friendly and even with all the booze  the bill was more than reasonable. Can't wait to come back!\n",
      "This place blew my mind! My husband and I were craving ramen noodles for weeks and we went there hoping to get some tasty Ramen  little did we know that their food was unbelievably tasty. The flavors and the unexpected twist to their menu went above and beyond what we expected.  I got the Brisket Ramen and my husband got the Lamb  they were both amazing but I highly recommend the Brisket.  This is restaurant has moved to my top 3 places to eat at in Philly. OUTSTANDING food and great service!\n",
      "Some foodie friends have been talking this place up to me so I finally decided to check it out  and it was definitely worth it.  The dumplings of the day were Pork and Mung Bean  and they were decent.  The dumpling dough is perfectly chewy and excellent as far as thickness.  The filling I thought was a little under seasoned  but when I rolled it around in the Chili Oil  it was quite tasty.  I also had the burger  which I thought was an unusual item to have on the menu for a noodle bar  but thought it would be interesting to try.  The burger is on more of a denser bread than a typical bun  and the mustard greens and acidic sauces worked great together.  The burger had a lot of Eastern flavors  but was still a burger  a well cooked one  at that.  Enjoyed a quick tasty lunch for 12 bucks.  As the temperatures rise this summer  I'll probably try the cold noodles and I think the ramen is calling for me this winter.\n",
      "Loved the noodles  charred brussels sprouts  beer options  decor  and service. The overall character is superb. When you have non-Asians run an Asian-themed noodle bar  greatness happens. Can't wait to come back.\n",
      "The goal of the day was to fill our bellies with warm and tasty ramen  and I am so happy to say we did that a Cheu! My friends and I actually started with the Black Garlic Wings (6)  which is great to share with 3 people. The wings were tangy and sweet  very flavorful  and I definitely recommend giving them a try. We also ordered the Butternut Rangoon  and can I just say that I could probably eat like twenty of those and be so happy with my life. They were so light and crispy  and absolutely addicting.  I ordered the Coconut Curry Noodles with a marinated egg. The the broth was so full of curry and a sweet coconut flavor  it was delicious! I also appreciated that the broth had a bit of heat to it  because the spicier the better in my opinion.The noodles were soft  and filling--so fun to slurp right up.   For two apps  and three bowls  it came out to $26  including tip  and I was full for the rest of the day!Definitely recommend trying this spot if you're ever in the city and need something to warm you up. I will be back to Cheu sometime soon!\n",
      "So I came here after all the hoopla on the foobooz site and because Matyson is an awesome byob(and who doesn't love delicious noodles). I have to say  had the burger and pork belly buns and they were excellent. Also had the BBQ crisp appetizer that had a great flavor yet it needed something to soak up the sauce. Finally had the lamb braised noodles and they were great. Again I wanted to soak up every ounce of the sauce. They should go against the norm and serve a nice crusty bread- blasphemy you might say but seriously something must be done to soak up these flavors.  Now onto the bad part  the prices.  Way too expensive for everything. Nan Zhou hand drawn noodles Isn't that far away and their delicious noodles are 3-5 bucks depending on either the peanut or soy pork sauce  Cheu's prices are around 11-15  and small to boot. Also sampan isn't far away with a great priced happy hour. I know Cheu is just starting up  so hopefully after a time they will be a little more affordable.  This place is great with a comfy feel and a warm and inviting staff.  I will be back  just not often or I'll be broke.\n",
      "Absolutely amazing! Must get the black garlic wings - they are to die for! My brisket ramen was delicious as well  I can not wait to come back!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was \\ok\\\". I've heard a lot of good things about this place and finally decided to try it. I had the chicken and waffles and was not impressed at all  the chicken desperately needed to be seasoned. I'm not exaggerating  the chicken had ZERO seasoning. The waffle was just...well  a waffle...nothing spectacular. My biggest issue is that everything was very bland (on my plate). My fiancé had the shrimp & grits benedict (it was the special this morning) and he really liked his  I liked his too. There were a ton of plates that came out that looked good  mine just wasn't one of them  unfortunately.   I may be willing to come back for the red velvet pancakes though  they looked amazing.\"\n",
      "Monday lunch was filled with people! That was a good sign.  Pressed tin ceilings and walls....minimal decor       - clean/green/white and bright.  Friendly service. Yummy food.  I ordered the tomato soup and grilled cheese combo (always a comforting dish.)    The sandwich description on the menu: cheddar  provolone  bacon  sun-dried tomato spread  and jalapeno relish.  The bread was very thick  thus NOT allowing the cheese to melt to the bread.  Very thick  not really melted cheese.  The jalapeno relish was just sliced large pieces of jalapeno (no relish).  The bacon was very tasty. Overall the sandwich was OKAY.  It had great potential!!!  The soup was good - but if the sandwich was a little more melted  I could have dipped it in the soup like I normally do.  It just kept falling apart.  Cute local joint.\n",
      "Located in south philly  the restaurant was somewhat difficult to drive to from the suburbs.  We visited this establishment mid-week around 12 noon  so the side street parking was ample.  We ordered the eggs benedict and the breakfast burrito.  The eggs benedict was doused in hollandaise sauce  and the herbs overpowering  although the eggs were cooked half decent enough.  The breakfast burrito was full of mexican flavor and plenty greasy  probably great after a long night of drinking.  The entire experience was mediocre at best  for which the food was easily forgettable.\n",
      "Delicious  Fresh and Innovative... .what's not to like.  Did I mention DELICIOUS.  Good Luck Gettin a Table!!\n",
      "This place is totally legit. Almost perfect!  Huge  amazing menu with tons of great brunch options. Full lunch offered too. Healthy plates make an appearance for sure with a whole area designated to salads and vegan options  and then there are meals labeled \\The Kitchen Sink\\\" or \\\"Chicken and Waffles with a million and one add-ons\\\". You get the idea. Total cult-following.  Cheap  inexpensive  and the orders came out quick.   -1 star for the irritation in our hostess' attitude when our table of 6 changed to a table of 7. They were planning on pushing two tables together anyway that easily sat 8  yet she was a total B about it and told us the wait would be another 30 mins. This is only after we asked her \\\"How long will the new wait be?\\\" and she responds  \\\"I don't know.\\\" When your first interaction with someone is them being awful  it can easily make you not want to ever return. Rude.   Other than that girl though  I think this place is top-f'n-notch. All other servers were sweet  knowledgeable  and on top of things. So many delicious meals were eaten this day and with prices like theirs  it really makes it hard not to want to eat here everyday.\"\n",
      "I went on a chilly Sunday afternoon around 2:45pm. They close at 4pm  so we made it just in time. It's BYO. The wait was only 5 minutes for two of us  and it was warm and cozy waiting in the large seating area. The tables are cute with plants  and the energy is happy and upbeat. The staff was very professional and friendly. The food was great! I ordered the Mexican chicken Benedict and my husband had the veg version- both were fantastic. The coffee was nice and everything was very fast. The side of fruit was beautiful and came with quite a bit of fruit! We ordered french fries just to try them  and they were hot and good. The one weird thing was that the potatoes with the veg benedict were not hot- just kinda warm. Otherwise fantastic experience. Cash only.\n",
      "I don't usually give 5-stars to a place I've only been to once  but since I know I'll be going back and will likely be impressed again  they're getting all my stars! One thing that drives me crazy about brunch lately is the wait time and the exorbitant prices. That being said  there are ways to avoid both  so I expect most places to recognize that and make amends.   Green Eggs Cafe seems to have found a happy medium by offering a bar service (which most diners have- get a clue people!) to those who don't care if they have a table setting. They also have a  gasp  waiting area with couches and a tv. Insanity! The place was bigger than most hot-spots  too  so eat your heart out Sabrina!  I found their menu refreshing. If I'm going to pay $$  I better not be able to recreate this dish at home. I usually get eggs benedict or juevos rancheros or an egg dish  but when my eyes settled on peanut butter crunchy french toast  I put the menu down and tried to keep my heart from beating out of my chest!! Yes  please! I also ordered a side of bacon and although I ordered it crispy  it was late and not crispy. I should have ordered the chorizo because it was very tasty and in a patty form. The best I've had in quite a while  and I love chorizo!  There were a bunch of other things I wanted to try. My friend got the grilled cheese & tomato soup  along with a cup of hot chocolate- all of which I want to try. Also  the fried oyster po'boy  corned beef reuben benedict (sweet Jesus!)  vegan shephard's pie....seriously  worth the wait.\n",
      "What can I say except the food is absolutely amazing here.  Don't go here if you are watching your figure though because portions are huge and calories are unknown :) Defiantly made for sharing which you will absolutely want to do because it's hard to decide on one dish.  I will say though  be prepared to WAIT.  You will WAIT to be seated on a normal day between 20-45 minutes and then WAIT about another 20-30 minutes for your food to arrive once you order.    If you are inpatient or extremely hungry and cannot take the WAIT  I recommend that you either arrive here as soon as they open to avoid the WAIT or just go somewhere else.  You can however go to the bar area and get coffee  cappuccino and pastries to make your WAIT a little more tolerable.  They also DO NOT accept credit cards which I think is absolutely ridiculous is this day and age but there is an ATM on site.  All in all this place is defiantly worth the WAIT and I will defiantly go here anytime I want to indulge.  I did however take 1 star off but that is merely for the WAIT because time is money and none of us want to lose that :)\n",
      "Upon first entering the Cafe  there's a cozy lounge area complete with faux fireplace which leads to the counter.  I imagine if GEC ever gets super busy a la Sabrina's  there the possibility of loading up that area with tables.  I enjoyed the decor overall...the colors are all found in nature  which totally appeals to me.  The cafeteria-style dining room felt huge but cozy.    Food was delicious!  I ordered the stuffed french toast  and I  as I say when I consume food quickly  HOUSED it.  It was enough to fill but not over-fill me on this extremely cold day in winter.  It was stuffed with blueberries and cream which I'd love to somehow incorporate into a future wedding plan...jrg ordered the pancakes  which he described as \\good\\\"  but he didn't house it.  He wanted them to be fluffier...however  he indulged in the excellent slab bacon  cook rare  just as he likes it  without his request.  He also ordered the potato side which I helped him finish because they were perfectly seasoned.  YUM!  We'll definitely go back to see how this fledgling business in our 'hood with a stated commitment to using local ingredients and other eco-friendly practices grows...\"\n",
      "The bathroom is moldy and the bathroom door doesn't close all the way. As pretentious as this place is  they could at least fix the bathroom.\n",
      "Great Coffee!!! But make sure you bring your Macbook  PC's are definitely frowned upon.\n",
      "Great coffee  good location tucked away off main tourist area with friendly staff. Decent food options too for a light lunch.\n",
      "The guys at Elixr are incredibly knowledgeable about coffee  different brewing methods and equipment and they take the time to enjoy it with you.    The barista that made my hand poured kenyan coffee told me all about the method and equipment he was using  and the coffee itself.  He took me through each step and at the end I had a flavorful and unique cup of coffee that truly satisfied.  I highly recommend Elixr if you're looking for not only a great cup  but a great overall experience.\n",
      "This is definitely a cool coffee place to go do some work and or meet up with a friend. Elixr has such a rustic and beautifully-designed interior  good wi-fi  and a gluten-free banana bread that is well worth trying!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Coffee/espresso snob here. Elixr never disappoints. The loose tea and chai lattes are excellent  too. Service is very sweet and simple.  Most have said it  but damn this place gets crowded. I'm happy for them! I work online so if I'm gonna come in from South Jersey I get here early in the morning so I can sit and enjoy my cappuccino while I work.\n",
      "I usually like this place for a good coffee and getting work done (minus unreliable internet). However  stay away from pricey croissants which are dry and can't be heated up. What a miss!\n",
      "\n",
      "The place is amazing! The bread  the service  the decoration! Love the pizza ns the grill cheese!\n",
      "We went to High Street on Market for brunch/lunch on a rainy Sunday and it was still packed!  It is a bright and airy inside although it was a little chilly near the front window (it seemed like the air conditioning was on even though it was dreary and cold outside- the vent was blowing cold air on us).  The host was very slow to bus the tables and reset them which lost a few minutes during our wait.  We had to wait about 20 minutes but it seems like tables turn over quickly.  It was a little awkward to stand along the side of the restaurant while waiting though and I felt like I was watching people eat.    We ordered one brunch sandwich- pastrami  egg  hash browns  peppers on a poppyseed brioche  and one lunch sandwich- duck meatball sandwich.    The brunch sandwich was excellent- the egg was perfectly fried and the saltiness of the pastrami was satisfying for brunch.  It was really fun to have a hash brown patty on the sandwich and have the potatoes along with everything else.  I did sort of wish there was some cheese or something on the sandwich and the portion of pastrami was a little meager.  The duck meatball sandwich was really outstanding.  The meatballs were so moist and tender and the duck was a fun twist on the classic.  The bread was super fresh and the cheese was perfectly melted.  The raw onions on top added a fresh tart flavor that I really liked.  There is also a rich smear of liver along the inside of the bread.    The prices are reasonable for the quality of the dishes and the service was very attentive.  There were two jars on the table with pepper spreads which were pretty spicy but fun to try.  Definitely a pleasant  enjoyable brunch spot in Old City and I'm sure we'll be back!\n",
      "Love this place. Everything about this place!  Super nice staff  very knowledgeable  give excellent recommendation  and very fast.  We order the bread - cause its too tasty to resist  - all three types were delicious and the pairing spread were really good.  For appetizer we got the mushroom salad. I'm not a big mushroom fan  but this salad is nice.  For main course we ordered the Duck ragu pasta and the shaved lobster one - we ate in silence and finish our plates.. yes - that good!  Def will go back again and again and again!\n",
      "I stopped in here for a quick lunch while sight seeing around the city. I had a turkey sandwich...but it was the best turkey sandwich I ever had! The atmosphere was great  too. I highly recommend!\n",
      "Randomly stopped here while in Philly...and so glad that we did. The service was exceptional--everyone we encountered was incredibly knowledgable and friendly (but not too over the top). The food was really  really delicious. You should really try the daily breads. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the entrees. Highly recommend!\n",
      "Excellent food  unique menu and wonderful atmosphere. Took a little while to get food so if you are in a hurry  this isn't the place for you. But if you want an amazing breakfast it is well worth the wait. Can't wait to go back.\n",
      "WOW!!! this place is absolutely amazing. From the dinner rolls  crispy broccoli  and perrogies  to the whole Branzino. Even the dessert was beyond. Well done! And the service is smart and welcoming. Walking in a Friday night even:) Thanks so much from a foodie in LA\n",
      "A nice and cozy place with an open kitchen. Long wait for a table!  I've been here twice. Each time  it feels like it's an hour wait.   However  this place does make some of the best sandwiches I've ever had. MY favorite is their grill cheese sandwich. By far  one of the top 3 places in philly to make it. It fills with ooey-gooey goodness.   Just to be fair to the other sandwiches  I have also tried their Roast Pork sandwich and Grill Eggplant sandwich. I like that each sandwiches come with a roasted long hot pepper. It's also a plus that they have good pickled condiments on the side.   Although i hate the wait  i'll definitely come back again.\n",
      "Delicious  creative and really great  warm service. Four of us ordered the chefs tasting menu  you don't know what you will get  which is kinda fun. The food just kept coming and every course was better than the next. Living in NYC we have no shortage of great places to eat and High rivals most of them!  It was really a treat to dine there and look forward to another visit next time I'm in philly.\n",
      "Great service  but most of all amazzzzing food! But make sure to come hinge cause their food sure is filling! The environment  as expected is also quite wonderful.\n",
      "We went here for drinks  not a huge drink menu but a cool atmosphere  take advantage of the outside seating if you can.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fries were really great. The service was pretty cool. The environment was cool. I went new years day. The scene is definitely trendy  young  \\hip\\\". All kinds of people  diversity-wise.   The food - Ok - WHY do people not know how to season beef? The patty was tasteless. Also  I asked for welldone and got medium well. I don't care if I don't have civilized taste. I dont like pink meat PERIOD!  Also  my baby ordered a black and white and only got chocolate. There was clearly not any vanilla  and the person who made the drink claimed it was vanilla in there. So I dont know  she was dissappointed with that. But our waiter was really cool.\"\n",
      "Honestly  how can you not like PYT? Cheap beers  stuffed burgers  great pickles. I have eaten the grilled chicken sandwich and the white bean burger - both were amazing. Boyfriend got a burger which I don't remember but he loved it. Will definitely go back!\n",
      "P.Y.T is known for their crazy concoction burgers. Deep fried Ellios burger - deep fried pizza used as buns. Krispy Kreme burger - grilled donut as a bun with chocolate dipped bacon. Deep fried Twinkie burger - not as sweet as it sounds and was actually very tasty. These are just a few of the specials we've had. Actually my hubby always orders the special and I have a bite. The specials are a heart attack on a plate and I don't know how he eats it the entire thing. The crazy concoctions are cool and good to try but if you really examine the burger itself it's just ok. There's nothing special about the patty and all the other stuff they put on the burger just hides the burger itself. If you want to try a different type of burger than this is the place to go. If you want a really good burger don't expect that here.  Other than the weekly special burger  the other highlight of this place is their adult milkshakes. Yup you read that right - alcoholic milkshakes. They are out of this world amazing and take some time to make so order it as soon as you sit down. I've come here before just to have a milkshake on a nice day. The cookies and cream is a staple for me. The Butterfinger is my hubbys favorite. They usually have a milkshake special as well.\n",
      "Just waited 35 minutes for their bbq blu burger while there is only 5 other people in the restaurant. I work in the industry  im supper mellow and  i made a point to download the yelp app just inform everyone possible that the serice here is horrible and they treat their guests like they have a mental handy cap... With out a doubt i would never work or be a customer here.\n",
      "Always have been overpriced and arrogant. I've tried them 3 times now and I'm done trying. Also  $40 minimum on cards at the bar is insane.\n",
      "Was great when it first opened  then a bunch of hipsters overtook it.  Horrible service.  Clingly weight-staff that continually talks to you while you eat.  If you want a good burger save some money and go to Shake Shack in Center City.\n",
      "It's a good place. The food is somewhat decent  the service sucks pretty bad  but if you're looking for a night out with good drinks and some friends it's a fun time for sure. A favorite of my friends so I wind up there by default. Also  if you check in on FourSquare you get a free beer. Good stuff right there. Also  this place is SUPER hip. So be aware that if you're trying to avoid the Philadelphian hipsters  this is NOT the place to go.\n",
      "Not a fan of Cafe Soho.  There are flies buzzing around your head the entire meal.  The bowls and cups need to be updated. It's just cheap stuff. The double fried chicken was all skin. Talk about overrated.   I will not be going back.\n",
      "Came here the other day with my cousin.. we came right at opening (3PM) and were the first ones there. I've never been here before and have been acticipating to come for the longest!! The food took a little longer than j expected. .esp because we were the only people there. But I'm sure it's bc the chicen is cooked to perfection.  We only ordered the Soy chicken bc the spicy would've been tooo spicy. But the soy was delicious! ! Super crunchy awesomeness in one little bite. We wanted to order the pineapple soju but it was too large to share with only 2 people.  Maybe next time! The decor is cute as well. It's a must try  but if you come on a busy evening  I'm sure the wait will be a lot longer than normal.\n",
      "Oh bon chon chicken  why are you so good. Why why why. And why do you have to come in 20-piece servings. Why not four  or five  maybe even six  so I can exercise some portion control? I mean...of course I'll order 20 pieces  if that's all you have. It is not my fault I only came with one person and we now have to eat 10 wings a piece. Right?  The chicken here is perfect - spicy (if you like it that way)  crispy  juicy and delicious. Love the radishes  too. Come hungry.\n",
      "I love coming here for some bomb Korean chicken but my last visit here the food took way to long to be made  especially when its only one order of half and half. Could use a better cook staff and not make me wait almost 50mins for only an order of chicken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heard all good reviews about the place   and gorgeous food selections with the exception we were interested.  I came along with a group of 15 people including some kids. It was a Saturday night around 8pm. At first sight it was a beautifially designed restaurant with neon lights to attract attention to customers with lounge area like sitting through upper level and regular restaurant seating on the lower level. Steady night it seemed with plenty of seating availability.  As we were being settled in at first glance   the menu was done very well with lots of pictures to embrace the food selections. Everything was going well until 5 minutes in service before we could order anything   the manager of some sort dropped a bomb shell on us that just left us with a very sour note. He came in asking if we're expecting any more people?  We answered no. Also mind u  they dont accept reservations.  On that note  he asked us if we can combine two tables with our group? Now mind u  the tables fit 2 -3 people per table. To have enough space for maneuverability.  So it would be 6-7 people he wanted together at one table. The reason behind the confusion   he said he is expecting a bigger party which hasn't arrived yet!  Wtf?? So on first thought we said wtf? Our business isnt good enough for our group that we have to accommodate for others that hasn't arrived?  Again there were plenty of seating available. So we all discussed how rude and inconsiderate thst was that it was very disappointing that to have brought to our attention. So we decided to leave overall and take our business elsewhere which wanted our business down the street at tofu house which was a lot busier but also still accepted us no problem besides the wait time of 10 minutes.  If you ever go to cafe soho.  ORDER TAKE OUT ONLY! HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!\n",
      "Best wings ever!  Bonchon is 10 minutes away from me but I still rather drive 40 min for soho. I always get the garlic soy and spicy. The spicy is SPICY. Wished they could do a spicy garlic soy that's half as spicy as the regular spicy.  Wished they would have a center city or Chinatown location\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is a gem and totally worth the 45-minute drive from South Philly. They almost exclusively do twice-fried Korean-style wings  but there are a few other items on the menu if you have a friend who's just not that into wings (what!). The wings are fried perfectly (super crispy skin and tender meat). The soy garlic sauce wings are unbelievable  spicy sauce is great  too (be sure to ask for some radishes on the side). Love the fruit + soju drinks (watermelon and lemon are the best). The servers are really sweet and have great food drink recommendations. Did I mention the K-Pop music videos? They're everywhere  it's magical.\n",
      "The wait is long which is fine but our order was wrong. We wanted boneless chicken wings and got the ones with wings instead. They said it'd be at least a 20 min wait and though we were very hungry we waited. When we got our boneless chicken it was like just eating the dried skin! There was no meat in these.. it was very hard to chew and I was still hungry after. After I told the waiter all we got was an apology. No discount or anything  which is what we would do where I work.\n",
      "Came here with a few friends during University City Dining Days and had a great time!   The vibe/look of the place is so cool. Very different  unique and something you just have to experience. ESPECIALLY the bathrooms - that's all I'm saying.   As for the food - some stuff was great  others blew me away! The Chicken Lettuce wraps are delish! The pork dumplings are good  but the wraps were better. The shrimp tempura roll was good - not the best I've ever had  but solid! The Shrimp Pad Thai was great - a little spicy  which i wasn't expecting  usually that's very sweet for me - but still very good! And a good size portion too! My friends got the New York Strip and it was great - came with some sort of fried potato ball  which is weird  but also really good!   Then came desert....each one was  for lack of a better word  weirder than the next  but also better than the last! I started with the HALO HALO BREAD PUDDING. No idea what to tell you this is but you have to try it  if you're adventurous! And like purple deserts! The cardamom fudge brownie was also great  and very interesting....but the sorbet stole the show. Weird saying that as that's usually juts an add on desert item  but it was delicious!   For Dining Days this is a great deal - we left with lots of to go bags  and full belly's  and loved it all!\n",
      "A 2-word description of this place: \\Morimoto Lite.\\\" Clean  colorful  modern atmosphere. Tried the eel roll  veggie tempura  double duck noodle bowl  lamb lo mein & a dessert of which I cannot remember. Service was good  food was decent- expensive yet worthy. (I am a huge fan of Morimoto's restaurant.)\"\n",
      "The environment is not welcoming because it feels pretentious  but the service was very good. The aesthetic is very futuristic. This is a nice place to go if you want to try something fancy  but portions are a bit small.   I ordered the tofu lettuce rap. The tofu was cooked with some sweet and salty sauce on the outside. I did not like this item and it was hard to eat because you had to eat it with your hands. It was made vegetarian for me.  The second item I ordered was eggplant on a skewer. This item was very delicious. It had a smoked taste and great presentation.  Although this place is a bit pricey  it was worth going for the experience. Tip: ask for tap water if you don't want to be charged for the bottled water. We did not realize the place would charge us $6.50 for the Aquafina water we did not even finish.\n",
      "I've been here 3 or 4 times and am writing based on my most recent visit.   Generally I enjoy my trip to POD and usually sit in the \\POD\\\" areas where they have colorful lights you can change which is a lot of fun for the group.   It can take some time to get your eyes used to the changes however.   We had dinner on a Monday night.   The restaurant wasn't very busy yet service was still slow.  It took about 15 minutes to get seated (even though we had a reservation)  15 minutes for our server to show up to the table  and 15 minutes to get our drink order in.  Luckily we weren't in a huge rush.  We did have to get up after we were seated to go find our server.   She was chatting with the bartender most of the night.  We decided to go with the tasting menu for 5...even though there were 7 of us.   There was still WAY to much food.   Not a huge problem from a customer standpoint  but you are full before the entrées even come to the table.    Even though we were spending almost $400 on dinner  we barely saw our server.   She came.  We were never asked for drink refills until dessert.   I sat most of the night w/ an empty beer glass.   It blows my mind when servers don't want to build up tip money.  The food was decent  there was just too much of it.   I wouldn't recommend the tasting menu.   Too much food.   No place to put it on the table.  You see the bus boy more than you see the server.  I'll probably skip POD in the future.  Nothing spoils a business meeting more than being angry that the server isn't at your table enough to attend to your clients needs.\"\n",
      "Had an amazing meal here tonight with friends. For our appetizers:  -Pork belly buns -lettuce wrap with chicken -Pork dumplings Of the three  my favorite was the buns and the runner up was the dumplings. Highly suggest both For second course:  -Sushi and sashimi plate -lobster pod roll -white tiger roll I think the hands down winner was the lobster pod roll  but the platter would be a great choice to share between two or more people. It gives you a lot of different things to try so you get a good basis on what flavors you like. Third course:  -caterpillar roll -a secret cream cheese roll. Ask about it I thought both were OK  with the caterpillar roll being better  but they both weren't as good as the lobster pod.  Dessert:  -salted caramel chocolate cake -spring rolls These were both on desserts. I was told that the donuts address the way to go here  but  alas  we didn't get them. Go for those of you get the chance.  Overall  one of the best meals I've had in a while and definitely a place I will be back to. Thanks Zach and Steven Starr for another amazing meal!\n",
      "Pod was such a unique experience. The setting  the lights  and the vibe were all pretty cool. We ordered the pork belly buns  lettuce wraps  and Korean Spade ribs. The portion size is small  but the food was beyond delicious. For dessert  we decided to try the mochi ice cream and the halo halo bread pudding. The mochi at Pod is by far the best mochi I have ever tried! It was so soft and flavorful. The halo halo bread pudding was different  not what we're used to. The bread pudding was the good part  everything was simply okay.   Overall  highly recommend the pork belly buns  lettuce wraps  and mochi ice cream!\n",
      "The sushi is excellent here and not overpriced. Great place to take fellow diners that don't like sushi \\ew its raw fish!!\\\"...there are many items to choose from to fit all types of palates.   The decor is weird but whatever. It is slightly distracting to see UPenn kids bring their out of towner parents to the most \\\"far out\\\" restaurant in West Philly. I have overheard many \\\"this is what its like on a spaceship\\\" comments. ugh   My favorite part of this restaurant is the martinis you order by color. I've had them all and the Blue is my favorite. Green is a close second. Pink is also good. hahaha\"\n",
      "we stopped by mid- afternoon to avoid the dinner chaos. Good location  excellent service  gorgeous interior  and super fresh food. Attention to detail in every aspect!  Love this place!\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks  Pod  for making eating here such a delight for a vegan like me! I am so happy with the amount of choices that I can make on the menu  and the fact that they will make a few things vegan for me upon request!   When I ate here a couple of weeks ago  I told my server I was vegan  so she made sure to veganize my side order of roasted asparagus (I think it normally has fish sauce in it or something). It was quite delicious  as was the Vegan Stephen sushi. I almost sent it back because I thought it was fish when it arrived. The tomato looks suspiciously like raw salmon! But  no  all vegan here  and full of fresh vegetables and stuffed with tempura'd veggies. Delicious!   For lunch today  I decided to go with an old standby: tofu lettuce wraps. These are very decadent. Deep fried tofu in a sweet and savory Asian sauce  with sprouts and onions  a side of peanutty sauce and some fresh butter lettuce leaves. I love that you can roll them up yourself. Fun lunch. And delicious. Thanks  Pod!\n",
      "In town traveling. So glad the husband and I agreed on BBQ. The setting is great as was our server Katie  very welcoming. The ribs were some of the best I have ever had  the BBQ sauce made it!!!! If we come back to Philly  definitely coming back!\n",
      "Was here last year for happy hour and the bar food was so-so but not great.  A lot of it sounds like it'd be tasty in theory  but the execution was off.  Wings are not that great - could be juicier  tastier.   I wouldn't recommend the cheesesteak egg rolls.  Bad combo  with skimpy overcooked filling.  Worse than any cheesesteak I've had  and worse than any eggroll I've had.  The space is attractive and comfortable.  Service is fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Awesome place. At convention and just stumbled upon it. Gotta try the Betty Burger It was best burger i have ever had!  Avocado   white cheddar cheese 1/3 lb beef  pork confit  garlic aioli  on fresh bun Coleslaw was slightly tangy but has sweet finish...creamy. Great price and good service. Other tablemates had bettys grilled cheese and bbq pork sandwich which were delicious. Lunch for 3 under $40. Great value\n",
      "Wanted to get some brunch as newbie in Philly  we googled this place and went on Sunday.  Place was really crowded  but it was big so we waited just little. I got egg while omelette and he got the burger.  My omelette was ok but I probably could make that one. He liked the burger and enjoyed fries too but we never went back there for their burger.  Maybe Philly has too many burger places.\n",
      "Good atmosphere  decent food  but nothing to write home about.  Party for ten on NCAA Saturday night.  The bar had the game on (yay) and we were seated upstairs at a long table with a booth on one side  but it was comfortable.  We waited a while for some rounds of drinks to come out  but the place was pretty busy so perhaps to be expected.  Good beer selection and some fun mixed drinks.   The portions were pretty enormous... half-chicken came with a ton of other food  the bowl of chili was enormous (topped with delicious and fresh guac and sour cream)  side of flourless corn souffle was tiny but aweeeesome  the burger-eaters said they were decent  and the fish taco-eaters were very happy.\n",
      "The Betty Burger met all my cravings - a sizable patty of beef  possibly hand-packed  definitely not the perfectly circular food service patty that some places serve - topped with pork belly (uncured bacon meat)  avocado  and a fried egg. My companions had various barbecue dishes and were vet satisfied. The server was knowledgeable about the menu and the beer selection  and brought samples of the beers we were considering (I try to drink local when traveling).\n",
      "We went here for a special event while we were in town for a conference and the staff and food were superb. They designed a (delicious) fixed menu for us with two courses for a group of 24 people. We had a nice upstairs space all to ourselves! The only downside was that the price was a little steep (fixed at $28 per person) and the online options showed slightly cheaper prices. Based on the food  atmosphere  and price I would rate it a solid 4 out of 5 stars.  However  we had the absolute best service and server  Seth  specifically and he alone made this review go from a four to a five. He was kind  gracious  accommodating for picky eaters  polite  and above all HILARIOUS (but not overbearingly / annoyingly so). We felt like we had this professional server with a dose of stand up comedy during dinner. He also stepped in as an amateur photographer and took about 20 group photos for us and kept cracking jokes and keeping us happy. Truly  some of the best service I've ever received and I highly recommend this place for your next big group event near city center\n",
      "Plus: Great burgers  cool location  good food all together  Minus: Staff is so so  last time the waiter barely came to our table  stood and starred at us and didn't take our order until I just started ordering. He also lied and said we were not allowed to have half sweet potato/half normal fries when I have gotten it several other times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just a simple Dutch dine-in... the food is done quickly and done right.  I've only been for breakfast  but I've heard great things about their lunch time meals as well.  I got the apple cinnamon french toast w  turkey bacon  overall really good  just wish there was a little more apple on the toast.  The turkey bacon were nice big slices and just the right amount of crispy edges... add a little syrup on there with the french toast and it was a perfect paring.  They have fresh squeezed OJ as well  but it tasted a little weird to me  maybe it was just those specific oranges. They also have scrapple... I think it's like Philly's version of spam  but I refuse to try it... just looks weird.  The staff are extremely friendly and the meal's are a good value.  Check it out in the Reading Terminal when you're there.\n",
      "If you're looking for breakfast in the Reading Terminal Market  the Dutch Eating Place is where to go. Just look for the crowds and you'll find a diner-like atmosphere with counter space and stools.  When I went  I ordered the blueberry pancakes with a side of bacon. The blueberry pancakes were good  huge  and moist. They were like most blueberry pancakes you can get at a traditional diner.  What blew me away was the bacon... Twisted and piled high on top of one my pancakes  I thought they were going to be chewy and under-cooked. Instead  they were heavenly strips of perfectly cooked meat. When I put them in my mouth  the taste was incredible and the texture was perfect. It pretty much dissolved in my mouth. Could it get any better?\n",
      "there is so many different places to eat in Reading terminal but this one caught my sister's eyes. I didn't really mind bc at that point  I would eat McDonalds (don't do it) bc I was starving. The wait was about 10 mins because they only have a small eatting area  seating for 30 people. GO WITH 2 PEOPLE (including yourself) - you will be seated earlier than the table for 3  4 5  6.. etc.  I ordered a turkey burger and my sister ordered corn nibbles (or something like that) and an open turkey sandwich. Both deeeelicious. Something about these Amish people but everything tasted fresh and they were really sweet and accomodating. The corn things were sweet... whcih freaked me out bc corn isn't suppose to be sweet... unless it's sweet corn  but this def was not sweet corn. It had some apple sauce or something mixed in with the corn which they batter and then lightly fry. It was just a wierd taste. Their iced tea is BOMB. they make it themselves and I think my sister and I drank too many for our own good.\n",
      "I gave this place a 4 5 stars because everything was incredible the dumpling was nice and a good portion of dough and apples and the caramel stuff. When she gave us our dumpling she put whipped cream on it but when we got back to our table it was complete liquid. I was very disappointed in this. I thought they had brains and they would use cold whipped cream not room temp. I mean it should be common knowledge. I feel that is was ok in general but if you come get whipped cream on the side.\n",

      "Do me a personal favor and get yourself to Percy Street to partake in their amazing BBQ Fries with brisket and melted cheese. I know. I didn't think it would go together either. Trust me  it does. Good. God. The brisket was so tender and flavorful  the fries were piping hot and fresh and the cheese was tangy and gooey. This was (clearly) my favorite dish of our meal.  My friends J  M  and I went for restaurant week. It's $35 for two people as opposed to one person as is the usual RW price and $20 for a single person. We had a pound and a half of meat and five sides plus two servings of mac and cheese and cornbread and two desserts. We were stuffed. We had the pork belly  ribs and burnt end of brisket. It was all delicious  particularly the Hot Mess sauce  but really  the BBQ fries (and red velvet cake) stole my heart. I can't wait to go back with T. I got a $10 coupon for Percy or Zahav while we were there. I have a feeling we'll be spending it at Percy ...\n",
      "Now this is how BBQ should taste in your mouth! And I was full. Two deadly combo --full and tasty. Fuuudge yea! Any who  I came here with family and friends  and we all decided to try different platters (so we can all sample each other plate of foods). The BBQ consist of a Memphis dry rub  and three sauce you can drench it with - go for the spice! go for the spice! The briskets - moist (fatty) - in my opinion - was the best bbq at this place... it just melted in my mouth  the baby back ribs were decent (not over the top - might have been bland a bit)  and the pull pork was pretty good. The only problem I really have at this place was the sides. The sides wasn't \\wham!\\\" in my face  the mac and cheese was okay and the cole slaw was a little running. However  the German potato salad was pretty good.   Anyway  I really enjoy this place.   * I was torn between giving 3 or 4 stars - but the service pushed my decision to 4 stars - awesome service    * they have family style BBQ - $26 per person (min 4 people)\"\n",

      "Stopped in for a cocktail and a quick bite to eat. Decor is nothing special  but comfortable. Great spirits and canned beer selection. Had the deviled eggs & turkey tails (which are an awesome idea) I could sit there all day drinking rye and eating turkey tails!  Update: Had a full dinner here with a group of eight.  Service was good   not great.  The ribs and deviled eggs were awesome.  Unfortunately they don't serve the turkey tails anymore.  The brisket just wasn't good at all...dry and tough.\n",
      "BBQ and service were excellent.  Had an early Sunday dinner at Percy Street before the crowds rolled in.  The place is really cute inside  the wait staff is friendly and very helpful  and the food is delicious. My friend and I both went for \\Double Downs\\\" (two meats and two sides).  I had the pulled pork and chicken with pinto beans and sweet potatoes. He had pork belly and brisket  with a double mac and cheese side.  We both agreed that everything was fantastic.  The pinto beans were a lot more like baked beans than I wished  but I don't really like baked beans.  No matter  I will get something else next time.  Sweet potatoes were sinfully good. Sauces come on the side in sweet  original  and hot.  The original was still a little sweet for my taste  so I much preferred the hot  especially with the pulled pork.  Drool worthy.  But try all three! Beers come in Mason jars with handles!  Bottom line:  Go!\"\n",
      "Amazing service  pretty good food  but really loud and really overpriced.\n",
      "Rename this place Pricey Street BBQ.  Tasty but not the greatest value.  Over the independence weekend-  We shared a Brisket platter and Watermelon infused beer selections.  Supposedly \\holiday spiked\\\" watermelon was rather tame. Bartender herself wasn't sure if our batch had been spiked at all-   Hey  it was free so we certainly didn't complain.   The sides were nice with the platter and our bartender /waitress added some white bread so we could make a few sandwiches.  All day dinner menu is rather spartan- A few more (imaginative) choices and a slight downward adjustment in prices would make this a 4 or 5 star choice and a great value to boot.  Service is great  as is atmosphere.  Location across from Whole Foods on South Street makes this a great stop/reward/treat after a hard day of organic politically correct shopping.\"\n",
      "This is a mixed review. First  I'll start with the good. My husband loved the flavor of his brisket sandwich (although he thought it was rather small). The cold slaw and beans with burnt ends were good (although a bit dry). The service was excellent and the atmosphere was good. Now  to the negative. I ordered the ribs. Can you say \\bbq flavored shoe leather\\\"? The were so tough and almost inedible. I am originally from Austin so I know what ribs should taste like and this wasn't it. I don't know if it was just an off day or if they are always that bad. I would tell the owner to go back to Lockhart for remedial lessons on ribs. When the waitress asked me if I wanted them boxed to take home  I told her that they weren't good. She did take them off the bill which I appreciate and it makes me think that the restaurant does care about my opinion. It might be worth a try going back to try other things on the menu.\"\n",
      "This place is incredible (as are all of the places within the Cook n Solo Restaurant Group). We decided to go for their Meat Week special and it did not disappoint! The food  service  and cocktails are all first rate  not to mention the extensive craft beer selection. We started out with the Biscuit basket which was served with honey butter and green tomato jam. There were 4 biscuits in the basket and the 2 of us polished them off in no time. We opted for the Meat Week special which included 3 meats  and 4 sides for only $45 a couple. The servings were HUGE! We had the ribs  chicken and brisket. Everything was incredible it was difficult to pick a favorite.  The service was also terrific  they were helpful and attentive without being intrusive and were quick to offer suggestions when asked. Top notch! We can't wait to go back!\n",
      "Delicious food I eat here a lot. I love the BBQ chicken  BBQ brisket it's delicious Mac and cheese and fries are my favorite sides here. MUST GET THE biscuits appetizer  MAC AND CHEESE. service is always great  gets busy on the weekends. Pricy for BBQ but it's worth the wait money.\n",
      "The Finest. Came back a week later because it was so good. The beef tartare appetizer was outstanding. Loved the hint of mustard in it. The lobster bisque was fantastic as well. The ribeye is so tender and pairs great with the bernaise. I'd skip the horseradish creme. It took away from the taste of the steak. The spicy broccoli on special was the perfect light side. We also tried the potato gratin  but were underwhelmed. The warm cookie dessert  though!! Washed it all down with the Blueprint Shiraz. James was my waiter both times - he spent the perfect amount of time at the table. Wasn't there enough to be disruptive  but never let a glass so empty. Super knowledgeable about how to describe the foods on the menu. Also love how trendy the atmosphere is here.\n",
      "This place was absolutely amazing!!! The atmosphere was incredible- a fun blend of modern and retro with low tables and love seats/chairs to sit in. The entrees are all a la carte but the sides are big enough to share! The 18oz ribeye is by far the best- it had the most amazing flavor! The truffle whipped potatoes are also definitely a must have. And no meal is complete without dessert and I must say- the only way to go is with the S'mores cake. It's a deconstructed s'more basically with a decedent chocolate lava cake with marshmallow and chocolate filling  and toasted marshmallow on top  and graham cracker ice cream on the side ( yes I did say graham cracker ice cream!). Take a spoon full of each part and prepare to be taken away to dessert paradise.  The restaurant also has some cool features  say a coed bathroom? Yes this place does in fact have a coed bathroom!! You walk in one door and there are a line of doors on the right-hand side labeled L and M.... pick your door and there you go. What an experience! Also when you're steak comes they bring out a tray of at least 8 different varieties of steak knives for you to choose from. What a fun way to make eating a steak an exciting experience! I will definitely have to go back!\n",
      "Quite simply the best meal I have ever had. From the service  atmosphere and ambience to the wine paired with the food by the server  and finally the selection of knives brought out to choose from to eat our steaks. This is hands down my favorite restaurant to date and their take on the Philly Cheesesteak with foie gras was a revelation. Easily the best tasting thing I've ever eaten.  This place is universal for satisfying all parties and occasions. Thank you for bestowing such awesomeness on the restaurant world  Stephen Starr.  Bravo  sir.\n",
      "\n",
      "By far one of the GREATEST restaurant experiences I have had in my life. Barclay Prime had the best steak I have ever tasted. The meat literally melts in your mouth. The macaroni and cheese is out of this world and the Halibut with truffle oil was MAGNIFICENT. If you want to try a little piece of heaven  save room for the S'mores dessert - TO DIE FOR.\n",
      "I went to Barclay Prime on Saturday with my fiancee and his family. My thoughts:  Decor/ambiance: like all other Starr restaurants  the decor and atmosphere was nice. The tables were well-spaced and the pillows in the chairs made for a very comfortable and relaxing dining experience.  Service: The waiter didn't introduce himself by name so when my future father-in-law asked  he was a little caught off guard and came back a little snarky as if it was a weird question to ask... but the waiter was nice and attentive throughout the night. Food came out quickly. Water wasn't always full but I never had to ask for it.  Food: Here's why I'm giving the restaurant just 3 stars. I thought the popovers and salted butter were amazing to start. I also enjoyed the apps. I got the lobster bisque which was velvety and delicious. Fiancee got the tuna tartare which was also pretty good. The entrees  however  were the biggest downfall. I got the miso cod (I don't enjoy steak) and everything was just overly salty that it was almost unpalatable. Most of his family got steaks which they seemed to enjoy  however  my fiancee and his dad got the same cut of meat and ordered it medium rare. One came out a little too rare and one came out more on the medium-ish side. For an expensive steakhouse  they should be more consistent.  Overall experience was good but I'm not really itching to go back anytime soon....\n",
      "From the time I opened the door til it closed behind us  this restaurant became my favorite in Philadelphia.  When it comes to fine dining in Philadelphia  I've had some great experiences and I've had some extremely annoying experiences.  The best will obviously include attentive service  amazing cuisine while the latter usually involves sitting too close to other diners at a kindergarten table yelling over their incredibly assinine conversations.    So the usual over priced finger food on small plates and euro trash tag alongs to the side were instantly transformed into a phenomenally cooked filet and incredibly prepared sides like creamed spinach and kobe beef marvels to start with.  The wine was perfect and I could actually hear what my girlfriend was saying during dinner  and I became a happy man.  For some restaurants in this town  giving me what I want seems to be an incredible hassle for them and I apologize in advance for the inconvenience.  Although remember....I am paying YOU afterall....what could I possibly be thinking. lol\n",
      "I took my son for his 18th birthday. He wanted to be ushered into manhood with some steak and swank. We dressed very nice since it said classy  but they don't enforce it...guys in baseball hats...sigh...so much for swank. We sat in the library which was very loud and the couch seating was uncomfortable.  As for the steaks  I got the porterhouse and my son got the bone in filet. Both steaks were cooked to perfection. However  they were way  way over salted... to me a good steak doesn't need anything on it. Why would you over-salt dry aged beef? The sides and starters (tots  whipped potatoes  lobster bisque and the bread were great). The service was good  as well. I just wouldn't go back  esp. for the cost... far better places in the area.\n",
      "If you're willing to drop some cash  Barclay Prime lives up to the billing. We had some massive amounts food including a huge hunk of steak that made my Uncle's eyes bulge and provided enough food for two meals. A non meat eater even raved about the sliders and the bevy of side dishes has something for every starch lover. You may leave with a lighter wallet but are well compensated by a full belly.\n",
      "This is the kind of place where Don Draper and Roger Sterling would go for an expensive two-martini lunch. Or perhaps Don would secretly meet here with a free-spirited brunette adultress before going home to Betty. It's all very masculine  dark  and sexy  like a library for dudes who like bourbon and expensive meat.  Don Draper would not bring Betty here.  The food was amazing. I had the Kobe and it was cooked to perfection. The Kobe beef sliders as an appetizer are an absolute must  and all the sides delivered as well. I remember some fingerling potatoes with garlic  shallots  and bacon (!?). The wine selection was one of those really long and overwhelming ones. Luckily we had a good waiter who suggested a bottle and he was right on. At least two people were taking care of our needs at all times without being overbearing.  When it came time to choose our own knives  we were so excited by the selection that he let us keep and play with them all. Thanks  dude!   Don Draper  I'll see you there.\n",
      "Place is dirty and not at all what it's web site promotes! Literally take out counter service! Our family could not sit together due to a broken chair and scattered seating! Most people that came in left mad due to the wait of getting their food! Not worth the trip! If I was Bobby Flay I would be mortified! Oh and as we were eatinh a homeless guy came to my husband begging for his food! Then sat with a family begging for food! The manager knew him by name   I'm guessing he was a regular!!\n",
      "I didn't get a burger here. I KNOW  who goes to a burger palace and doesn't get a burger? Well  I was getting dinner later. (Please see my Don Memo review.)  I ordered fries  because my friend who was with me said they were SUPER amazing or something. They were decent fries and the fry sauce was interesting  but I wasn't as blown away by them as I thought I would've been. Should've gotten onion rings  I always looooove onion rings.  I don't know what burger my friend got  but he polished it off pretty quickly. I like that you can get chips in your burgers because I love having some crunch in my sandwiches. I will definitely have to try one the next time I stop by. I will also try a shake  because I hear those are good also.  Is it true that the people who work the tables are called NINJAS? If so  that's pretty awesome.  Mmm  so since I didn't get to experience what makes BBP really special  I can't give it more than just a satisfactory review. Nothing made me upset  but nothing made me extraordinarily happy about my fries and the establishment. The decor is pretty fun  though  so it's a nice place to just chill with friends over burgers and shakes.  Will definitely make a note to visit again. I hope I will be able to upgrade this review after I do!\n",

      "Charles the manager was very friendly and accommodating. Extremely courteous.  The burger was hot and tasty and fresh French fries.\n",
      "I am on a constant quest to find the ultimate burger.  I am talking about perfect meat  perfect bun  perfect toppings.  Sadly  my quest is not ending at Bobby's.  However  this is a pretty solid burger joint.  When entering BBP  the interior is pretty cool.  It has a giant bar that loops around in front of the kitchen  and then a bunch of high tables along the perimeter.  When we visited  there was no wait to order our food (despite it being one of the first Saturdays that school was in session).  When we sat down  our burgers came out pretty quickly.  Service  from my experience  is pretty good here.  The burger itself was good but not earthshattering.  I think people mostly come here for the funky toppings (like the crunchified burger with potato chips) and spiked milkshakes.  The meat and bun was just average.  I got the Dallas burger  which had monterey jack cheese  BBQ sauce  pickles  and coleslaw.  To be honest  it was a little bit too much and I had a tummy ache later in the day :/  Not your fault  BBP  I should have known by the description that it was going to be alot going on under the bun.  I would definitely come back and maybe just try the crunchified burger and get one of those spiked milkshakes.\n",
      "I have no problem with the flavor of the food here.  It tastes great each time I come.   Two things keep this from being a 5 star review for me though.  The rotating Burger of the Month keeps things interesting  but (unless I'm overlooking something or out of the loop) you can't build your own. I am used to more choices and being able to customize. The burger selections seem pretty nice  but there's only one that's anything like what I would order if I got to choose the toppings.    Since the one I always order is damn delicious  I might still rate five stars except for my other issue.  Whenever I order to carry out  the service staff can never coordinate and get the food to me when it's done.  It sits in the window for a while with everyone peeking at it from time to time  then when I ask how much longer  I find out it's the same bag I've been staring at for 10 minutes.    I don't understand why they don't call out the order when it's ready (if ordered in store) or why the order isn't brought up when it's paid for (if ordered over the phone). This has happened to me every time I've decided to do carry out  regardless of how busy the dining room appears to be & I've seen others experience the unnecessary wait as well. It's not that hard to ask the people who are not dining in what the name of their order is  just to check. Everywhere else seems to be able to do it.\n",
      "Overrated. Seriously Bobby Flay owns this place? Could have fooled me with their pre-made  frozen onion rings and mediocre burgers. Granted  I did not try their onion rings but I sat directly in front of their open kitchen and witnessed the cooks opening boxes labeled \\onion rings.\\\"   Hmmm...really Bobby? Am I asking for much? Given your reputation  I would've thought your restaurants made everything fresh to order even if it was a casual burger joint.   Burgers were not memorable. A good burger doesn't need to be complemented by a million sauces  but all I remember was pouring loads of their assorted sauces to compensate for the lack of taste. Sweet potato fries were decent but again  not memorable.   I do remember liking the decor of the restaurant-very vibrant and hip.  Still  I'd rather eat at Five Guys and still have money left over for dessert.\"\n",
      "Hype? Maybe. I ordered a Classic with American medium well. In retrospect - I should have tried it medium. The burger was on the dry side and although it was tasty and properly cooked  it lacked texture.  I blame the patty itself. After the fancy decor  long line and multiple assurances that this would be the best burger I would ever have  I didn't expect a pre-shaped patty.   I enjoy the ritual of the condiments almost as much as the burger itself. I really like a hamburger topped with lettuce  tomato and onion w/ my own at the table mix of mayo and yellow mustard. There was a good sized slice of tomato and onion. The lettuce was puny  resembling endive. I did ask for more lettuce and got an identical piece to supplement it. The condiments were good - just not enough lettuce.  My daughter had grilled cheese  - which was served charred pretty near black. The charred side served face down. She ate it without complaint and enjoyed it. She's 5.   Fries were good. They were served warm  not hot. Not enough big fries  lots of the dregs of the fryer fries. Luck of the draw  some people like that. I ate them all. Like that dipping sauce.   Over all I don't think this burger met my expectations. I find the best place to get a burger is at your favorite tried and tested local pub or diner.\n",
      "I really tend to be anti-Bobby Flay because I dislike his TV persona  but I love the burgers here.  I have tried two different styles  the Santa Fe and the Dallas  both very very good.  Both times the burgers were cooked to a perfect medium (which is hard to find these days).  Between the two I would recommend the Santa Fe over the Dallas  but I don't think you could go wrong here.  Both the sweet potato  and regular fries are quite good.  The prices for the food are reasonable  but not cheap (although the beer is an OK deal).  Bottom line  if you are in University City and hungry for a burger  you should definitely go here.\n",
      "Nom Nom Nom! Today I ventured down a few blocks to Bobby's Burger Palace. I am SO glad I did! I got the Napa Burger (a delightful blend of amazing beef  watercress  goat cheese  and lemon honey mustard dressing). The bun was delicious and fluffy and the burger had an amazing array of flavors. Add goat cheese to anything and it instantly becomes delicious.  I also got their sweet potato fries and side honey mustard horseradish dressing (eeeks! making this at home asap). They gave me a generous serving and they were absolutely crispy beyond belief  but then deliciously fluffy on the inside.  I had to give BBP 4 stars because  as a to-go customer  there isn't a great place to wait for your order. However I will definitely be going back and hopefully can convince myself to stray from this amazing burger and try his other creations. Yummy!\n",
      "Ordered a house salad and mussels: Salad consisted of iceberg lettuce  4 cherry tomatoes and French fries on top.  Very bland and u satisfying at   The mussels were ok -- served in thick  Parmesan cheese covered marinara sauce so no broth for dipping. Cold  stale bread was served on the side but was essentially inedible.  Ordered the dish because it was highlighted I the menu \\award winning\\\"....however it was mediocre at best.  Truthfully  the highlight of the meal was the wine selection and the fries...  Service was fast and cordial...  Would only return for a drink ... Maybe try a burger?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Really  they deserve a 1/2 star.  Ordered the roast pork sandwich and crab fries.  The roast pork sandwich is supposed to be hot  but it was cold.  Further  the bun was not cut all the way through so I essentially had to rip it (plastic cutlery is not particularly effective.)  I told my server the sandwich was not hot.  She returns it with attitude and clearly the entire basket was thrown in the microwave.  The pickles were hot and so were the hot peppers.  I simply asked for fresh pickles and peppers.  The peppers I got were obviously from the bottom of the jar  all stems  seeds  and pith.  The sandwich is served with a side of greasy-looking dipping juice.  Had it been prepared correctly  I bet this sandwich would be an \\average sandwich at an airport.\\\"  I am giving the crab fries a half star.  Though they are frozen  they were right out of the fryer  crisp and not soggy in any way and seasoned well with Bay.  The accompanying sauce is some flavorless white cheese sauce  and you get two.  The serving is huge ($6) and you cannot get half an order.  I ate about 10.  The server was busy  obviously they are understaffed.  Poor management  I suppose.  I had to stand up to get her attention to pay my bill since I needed to catch a flight.  She sucked too.  Poor attitude.  Don't take it out on the customers  lady.  Next time I am at this terminal  I will be Dionne Warwick and Walk On By.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This is for Terminal E waiting for Frontier flight. Service is slow  crab fries are over-priced and overhyped. Think I got my sodium intake for the month with a quarter of a portion. Need more people servicing the bar and a little faster service in the kitchen. Would I come back? Only if other bars were closed.\n",
      "I made a random decision to stop for lunch after a flight.  My server was very quick and friendly.  I ordered the cheesesteak with peppers and onions along with the crab fries. The cheese steak bread was cold and slightly stale.  The cheesesteak and cheese was hot  which made eating the sandwich a little more tolerable....until I found a cellophane jar seal embedded in the meat and cheese.  I assumed it came from the jar the peppers were dispensed from because the peppers were cold too.  Fries?  Cold.  The dipping sauce for the fries was decent  but overall  I was very disappointed with my meal.  I think if the food was hot and the bread was warm  I probably would have enjoyed it  but almost gnawing on plastic was a deal breaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It's better than most airport food. I have never been to their \\real\\\" location  and only eaten at the airport ones. It's decent enough. My husband and I will normally split a wrap or sandwich of some sorts  and get the crab fries (which are so good). The beer is always cold  and the staff have always been friendly. Definitely one of the better options to go and sit down and eat at.\"\n",
      "Horrible cheese steak!!! The crab fries were pretty good but over all just bad. The service is sub par  but it is at the airport  so I get it.\n",
      "My husband and I took my mother here for her 100th birthday! We can't say enough about the treatment we received: from a great table and view  to delicious \\compliments of the chef\\\" extra dishes  to a beautifully decorated cake plate  to the warm and attentive servers. It was much more than we expected  even for this very special occasion. For us  it was a wonderfully memorable experience.\"\n",
      "great food  great view. Try the lobster mac and cheese\n",
      "Second stop for Center City Restaurant Week:  R2L  dinner for $35 each.   On the 37th floor of Two Liberty Place is a very fancy-cool restaurant/lounge where you can get a bird's eye view of the city! Group of us went to dinner here together after a day of meetings. Didn't get one of the tables facing the windows  but still had great views of the sunset and city by night. Again  multiple choices for the three courses  but I chose to start with the crisp peas/ham/garlic risotto [balls]. Main course was the Butcher's Filet (braised short rib + Steuben bean chili  potato/farm veg slaw and basil)  which was quite heavy since there was also meat in the chili as well. The dazzling dessert to finish it off was the milk chocolate + hazelnut pudding served with salted caramel and coffee to melt the chocolate  and candied almonds on the side. A bottle of wine for the table as well. Food was great  waiter was awesome (making sure to warn me that the risotto came in ball form rather than a bowl  for instance)  very classy experience.\n",
      "Walked into the restaurant  with reservations  and many open tables.  I asked the manager for a window table and was responded with \\they are all reserved.\\\"  Two hours later  when we left  still many open tables next to the windows.  Overall food was good. I had the filet and she had the salmon. The bottle of wine that was recommended was $75 and was not told prior to ordering it  just that it was the last bottle.\"\n",
      "Came here for my 21st birthday dinner with my family and had a great experience! The food and drinks were to die for  but they were extremely overpriced. Even though the quality of food was good  I still don't think it was worth what we paid for. I recommend getting the lobster mac and cheese as an appetizer  it was probably the best mac and cheese I've ever eaten. At the end of the meal  they gave us some small complimentary desserts  even though we ordered a bunch of desserts to top off our meal. Had a great time  but definitely overpriced.\n",
      "This review is for a corporate event in a private dining room with a limited food menu & bar.   I was blown away! One of the best meals I've ever had and service was flawless  expert  courteous  and never intrusive. Passed hors d'ouevres were creative and tasty. Lobster consommé was delicious and filet was PERFECTLY cooked & seasoned  melted in my mouth  and a generous portion. And that view is just stunning! Actually a better view from our private room than the main dining room  where I've been for a happy hour event (which was less perfect since the space was very overbooked resulting in slow service). Highly recommend for an event and may be back here for a special occasion dinner.\n",
      "An amazing view  impeccable professional service great fare don't  skip a visit to this Philadelphia gem. Nick  who is a stellar  incredible server  recommended a lovely 2010 Bordeaux-Chateau Font Merlet which complemented the Tuna Tartare and Steak Tataki.  This is a must see in Philadelphia. After witnessing a fabulous nighttime view  I can't wait to return to check out the spectacular sunsets.\n",
      "On May 14 of this year I took my boyfriend and our daughter here for his 34th birthday. And may I say  we had a wonderful experience. The drinks were top notch and the food was something out of this world. Taylor our waitress was Awesome! Every server waiter waitress that night was great. We'll definitely keep coming back.\n",
      "Overall  a Great Experience!!! My wife and I celebrating our 5 year Anniversary and had a Fantastic time. Not just the Food was off the hook  but the wait staff was very attentive. And what can I say about the views. Thank you guys for making our night memorable.\n",
      "There are restaurants with views and then there are views with restaurants. This belongs to the latter group. Had I known there was a view involved I would not have booked a table as the food is so often an afterthought and overpriced  this was no exception. The cooking was erratic  ranging from superb to amateurish. Fennel appetizer was sensational. Short ribs were dry and stringy and served tepid. The skate was perfect but the fettuccine lackluster. The light over our table was burned out so we ate in partial darkness which only served to highlight the short comings of the dishes. Loved the bread selection at the start and the shortbread cookies and jellies at the end were great! It's a good place for drinks and bar snacks and it feels special. If you care about the food  go elsewhere.\n",
      "Most places are successful when they have an outstanding employee. Max went above and beyond. Stopped in for the first time last night. Everything was great. No complaints. Clam chowder  burger  and beers were great!! It's a big plus that he knows the beers well too. Cheers GENTLEMEN!!!\n",
      "I am still a fan  a big fan.  It all started with the hand pumped Yards IPA.  What a great alternative to the already very good Yards IPA on tap...less bubbles  natural  no CO2  creamier texture  a real beer-person's beer.  Next the Tuna Poke.  This was a wonder dice of fresh raw tuna  with avocado and it tasted like a chili oil base  with blue chips for accompaniment.  Next up was the Blue Fish BLT.  Yes fans  the thick meaty fish was on scrumptious thick toasted bread  the real good bread  with the real thing bacon  not strips of that processed packaged shit  the real McCoy  thick  tasty  meaty  the kind of bacon which makes you smile.  Excellent in season fresh tomatoes topped it off.  This was wonderful in all aspects.  My friend had the Heirloom tomato sandwich.  The Heirloom tomatoes were soooo fresh  sooooo sweet  sooooo decadent  on wonderful toasted bread with a pesto aioli.  I wish I had the stomach to order one in addition to the blue fish sandwich...I thought about it!!  Brandon was superb behind the bar  helpful  friendly  he loves his job and he loves the food there as well.    This is my go-to spot in the Northern Libs\n",
      "I had heard for years just how good Standard Tap was and decided to stop in for a drink on Saturday (5:30 pm) prior to dinner at Koo Zee Doo.  I am not sure what the hype is all about. We sat at the bar  which was half full at best  and waited as the bartender walked by us multiple times  walked away from the bar and never asked us what we would like to drink.  I finally said in an even tone  \\Hey  you serving drinks here\\\".  That got us some service.  We had two rounds of drinks  I paid and left the tip on the bar  while my wife finished up her beer  I hit the Men's room.  When I came back the tip had been picked up  again before we had left  and I asked my wife  if the bartender thanked her.  She said  no he just picked up the money.  Classless move. This place must be doing so good that they don't need new customers  because I probably won't go back.  I'll keep going to 700 Club and Abbaye when I'm in N. Libs.  This place needs to learn a lot about the meaning of service.  The only reason that I gave them 2 stars was that we did not try the food and I'm giving that benefit of the doubt. Hey  Standard Tap take a lesson from places like South Philadelphia Tap Room on how to run a great gastropub.\"\n",
      "Great beer  great burger  great service.  I really liked the atmosphere and had a great time.    The burger was tasty and our medium rare burger was actually medium rare.  One of the best  if not the best  burger in the City.\n",
      "We stopped in for brunch last Saturday while visiting the city. The place looked neat from the outside and was even bigger once you walked in with bars and seating on numerous levels. We were seated quickly upstairs and they have their menus on a chalk board (this annoys me). It was an interesting menu and I went with a spinach salad which came with blue cheese dressing  egg  bacon  tomatoes and cucumbers. Others in my party ordered a burger with a salad instead of fries. Another one of my pet peeves is when they up charge for a different side. The burger and small side salad ended up being $17. The food was tasty and served quickly by very friendly staff. Overall it was a fun place to hang out and I would like to go back for drinks- they have a nice draft list.\n",
      "I really like the atmosphere and location  and they have a good beer selection  but Jesus Christ have I only had terrible food here. Pretty sure their veggie burger is just bread crumbs and eggs to keep it together. It's hands down the worst one I've ever had. And their brunch isn't anything special either. Go here for drinks - there are too many great restaurants within walking distance of this place.\n",
      "What a great place!  I went the other night with my mom and two young kids.  We sat on the outdoor deck.  I was the only person in the group into craft beer  but we all loved the bar.  My mom enjoyed a nice local saison and said the crabcake was the best she's ever had.  My kids enjoyed shrimp cocktails and corn fritters (no kids menu  but we felt comfortable with well-behaved kids).  I had a great duck leg. We orderall all three desserts on the menu  and they were all smash hits. I've seen better beer lists  but their were so many food choices I could go back again and again  and I will!\n",
      "I was brought here with by my friend to try the \\standard double\\\" which was taken off the menu. But  they did make it for me even though they charged me $3 to add 2 slices of bacon. All in all a very expensive place  that you might want to add to your skip list.\"\n",
      "Very good burgers  soups  cheese plates  you name it. All of our food was amazing and cooked to perfection. Would definitely come back and I recommend you try it too. It's worth it.\n",
      "Une magnifique carte de produits locaux  fruits de mer  viandes  poissons  légumes... Des bières locales excellentes. Service de qualité très agréable et de bon conseil. Le tarifs sont corrects pour ce gastropub certes loin du centre ville mais qui vaut vraiment le détour  dans un quartier de plus en plus fréquenté.  Seul petit point négatif: un peu bruyant lorsqu'il y a du monde...\n",
      "The new Han Dynasty took over the spot where the old Mid-Atlantic restaurant (with the unchanging menu) was. I like the Han Dynasty here a lot more than the one in Olde City even if I give both 4*. Maybe I'm biased  because I love the service here. They've always been very nice  and came over to check in with me and just make some small conversation when they heard I had a peanut allergy (even though they had no peanuts in any of the dishes I ordered  I think it was Han's sister?). I've been to this Han Dynasty more times in a month than the number of times I've been to the other.  Note though  that the different branches have different specialties. I heard the dan dan mian in Olde City is the best  but the one in UC isn't so good (I wouldn't know since it has peanuts). Overall  I think it s okay food wise  still not spicy enough as with the other branch. But I like the layout and atmosphere a lot more.  Next  if you go during lunch  you can ask for lunch portions  that are smaller than the dinner portions  and half the menu price! So it's a great lunch place too  alone  or in a group of 2 or 3.\n",
      "Awesome food  great place to split a bunch of delicious spicy  ultra flavorful dishes with a large group. It's the Chinese restaurant a lot of people know about for good reason - I haven't had a single bad dish here  and it's always a crowd-pleaser.\n",
      "I've had the fortune of eating my way across Asia Pacific  so I might be biased in saying I don't understand the rave reviews. I will say though that the conversation and company I was with more than made up for this!\n",
      "I waited a long time to finally try this place and I have to say I was let down a bit. I tried the mandatory Dan Dan noodles. They were very flavorful and not too spicy. Nothing mind blowing here just a really good lo mein or spicy pasta dish with virtually no protein more or less. Also had the scallion pancakes. I was just in Chinatown recently at a place I also reviewed (first person from Yelp to do so) and they were way better there. ( I highly recommend you try that place) These were more like quesadillas laying flat where as the other ones jumped off the plate and were so much more crispy and substantial. The last appetizer I had was the Wontons in Chilli oil. These were just not good to me at all and one bite was all I needed. Basically it is steamed Wontons in a bowl with the soup being the chilli oil. Just heavy heavy choking heat with very little substance or taste. Take those same homemade wontons and pan fry them with some chilli peppers and a nice light sauce and you have could a real winner but I digress. Finally we tried the Talapia Medallions . These were fried to perfection but there were some greens mixed in that I could not chew through and had to discard via the old napkin trick which to me is a bit of a deal star breaker.  The service was very good and the atmosphere very nice but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. All I could think about was how much more I prefer Cantonese style where its all about flavors and you can add heat as you like it. I'm sure I could find better authentic Szechuan cuisine that better suits my taste just not here. It feels very commercialized and Americanized. I prefer the hole in the wall places where I am the only caucasian in the place a heck of a lot more.\n",
      "Ok. I am not the type to complain  but I have been here twice and both times I have had terrible service at the bar. The first bartender served me but acted as if I was bothering him.  This second time  with a completely different bartender mind you  it was worse. I am not dressed like a street person or anything  and I am not pan-handling. But you would think that I was the way he acted. First  I sit at the bar and I am waiting for service. So  the bartender walks by me  pours a glass a water  turns in front of me  puts the water down  gives me some stupid half-grin then walks off. Not one audible word of greeting or a grunt passed between his lips. Then  he gets a menu  drops that down and walks off again! Not a sound. Is it me  but when a customer enters an eating establishment  shouldn't they be greeted in some manner?  Not looked at like \\why are you here. I have better things to do\\\"?  I am not looking for a royal salute or anything. Just \\\"Hey man  what can I get ya?\\\"  or something to that affect.   Anyway  I start to look at the drink and food menus. Then  a group of anywhere from 10-15 people come in behind me and say  to what looked like a manager  \\\"We don't want to eat  is it ok if we just have a few drinks at the bar?\\\". The manager says \\\"Sure.\\\" The guy then says  \\\"Can we get few beers down here\\\"? (paraphrasing). The bartender says \\\"Sure!\\\" and proceed to service this group  one-by-one  as they order drinks. Ok  fine technically  I was looking at the menu when this started. But still  he walked back and forth  right in front of me  for about 10-12 minutes. Not once did he say  \\\"Hey  just shout and I will get you something\\\"  or \\\"Hey man  just give me a few minutes and I will be right with you\\\". Nothing!  It was obvious it was a big group  but I mean  he gave no acknowledgement to the fact that I was sitting there waiting!   Long story short - after this 10-12 minutes of waiting  I just walked out and went somewhere else. Now this place has about 4\\\\5 stars with around 500 reviews. So  I guess people like it. But their bartenders are as unfriendly as I have ever encountered.  Maybe if you get a table it's different.\"\n",
      "Amazing. Ham Dynasty is an interesting execution of really good Asian food. It's \\family style\\\" which means they bring each dish out as soon as it's ready and you're supposed to share. And when they say \\\"as soon as it's ready\\\" they mean within 5 minutes of your order. We were amazed at how fast the food came out  and our server was extremely nice and helpful. The menu also has helpful numbers to indicate how spicy each dish is going to be.  We had a few different dishes for the table  and polished them all off  because we loved almost everything we ordered.  This place is really a tremendous dining experience.\"\n",
      "The Han Dynasty was a great venue for our wedding rehearsal dinner! Their dishes are very authentic Chinese cooking and everything we had tasted great. The menu selection and service were excellent  and Megan helped us create a custom menu to mix authentic Chinese and kosher styles  while also incorporating plenty of items for vegetarian and other dietary restrictions. The restaurant comfortably seated 80+ people in their side area with constant  friendly service the whole night. In spite of some misunderstandings on menu totals and pricing  Megan was very patient and accommodating and helped us sort everything out. At the end of the night  our family and friends loved the food and everyone had a great time.  I highly recommend the Han Dynasty to anyone for great food  service  and events coordinating!\n",

      "Han Dynasty is one of my favorite restaurants in Philadelphia.  I first found the Manayunk location  and my wife and I ate there several times.  We heard about it from a friend who turned us on to the spicy cucumbers  which are just wonderful.  Eventually I tried the University City location  and it's much more \\hip.\\\"  I really don't care about ambiance  but if you are seeking a more polished/trendy type of place  go to University City over Manayunk.  The food in both places is just incredible.  Han Dynasty serves food in very large  family sized portions.  It's most fun when you are with a bit of a group  so you can order a number of different things  and try them all.  On their \\\"specials\\\" menu  they have Spicy Aroma Fish which is just absolutely beyond this world.  SO good.  Another major hit was the dry pot style.  My wife and I are big seafood fans  so we get shrimp as the protein  but you have complete flexibility to pick whichever protein suits your taste.  They have numbers on the menu  1-10  beside each dish.  This is the relative spiciness rating.  It's really hard to describe the type of heat in these Szechuan dishes... it isn't the kind of heat that just burns your mouth.  The heat is very strong  but it's all flavor.    Dry pepper style is another type of preparation that we have tried and loved.  Several reviews mention the Dan Dan noodles... they are wonderful  but they are indeed rather oily.  It's just the nature of this cuisine.  I think the food is wonderfully prepared  one just has to know that chili oil and sesame oil will make the food a bit on the oily side.    Absolute top notch rating for this place.  Love it!\"\n",
      "Couple of notable impressions:  - The first thing that got me was the decor of the place. Chopsticks were made out of red plastic  and the napkin was just paper  not cloth. Water came out in glass cups. The impression was overall a little cheap  which surprised me. On the other hand  the servers did keep water refilled well and tea was presented immediately.  - A lot of the reviews remark that the dishes are very spicy. I was surprised to discover it was pretty tame. The Dan Dan noodles come in at a 6 and it was imperceptible. We got another dish coming in at an 8 which also was hard to notice. Not sure what the explanation might be since I don't consider myself to be especially tolerant  but perhaps I'm more so than I think?  - Service was very fast. I think our food came out within ten minutes. Certainly the Dan Dan noodles were instantaneous.  - Finally  the food itself is delicious. The Dan Dan noodles especially. I also had some kind of dumplings and an entree  I unfortunately can't remember the names  but both were enjoyable as well.  - The bill was a bit pricey. I think they give a lot of food for two  so it's may be justified  just unwanted for two relatively small people. Fortunately  they make taking it home easy if that's something you'd like.  EDIT:  - After visiting a second time with a large group  I discovered they have a very nice seating area for groups (to the right and somewhat below ground). We got a circular table which I really liked for discussion. Definitely would have appreciated a turntable  but no big deal.  - A tip from our server: the spice tends to be the kind that creeps up rather than is entirely overt. Besides water  consuming tea and rice helps to reduce the effect of the spice.\n",
      "mmmm burgers and milkshakes.   i love that you can sit outside.  i also love that the food is always piping hot and delicious. I love the creamy cheesesauce for the fries. i love that even when the line looks long  the wait is never really that long. i love the reclaimed bowling lanes that have been turned into tables.  i dont love:  hmm. drawing a blank.\n",

      "Solid burgers and shakes.    Best fast food-esque burger in Philly  definitely better than five guys.  Only draw back is the price...where it will run you about 15 bucks for a small burger (1 patty)  fries and a shake.  A bit too expensive for casual lunch outside of NY.  The price is even more offensive after you consider a double double animal style with fries and a shake from In & Out Burger in LA is only 8 dollars.\n",
      "First time at the Shake Shake on a Saturday night at 9:30. It was still bumpin'. The menu is pretty big and written on the wall... It was a little overwhelming as a first timer. I went with a simple vanilla shake and my wife got a 50 50--iced tea lemonade. My friend got a PB shake and fries. You get a buzzer to alert you when your food is ready--great idea! We got our items very quickly  despite it being very busy. There are tables and a counter to sit at. It was very full so we sat at the counter. The fries are really good--so crispy. The shake was also awesome--perfect consistency. Can't wait to go back and have burgers and fries. I like that they have tons of bike racks and planters around the inside.\n",
      "My first visit to Shake Shack (not just the one in Philly but any Shake Shack anywhere) was a success overall.  The line moved very quickly considering it was dinner time on a Friday night. I wasn't even planning to order anything as I wasn't hungry  but wound up with a bacon cheeseburger and a side of ice cream. Go figure.  The burger was very good though not some blissful nirvana that all the hype would suggest. A better one can be had right across the street at Village Whiskey. The ice cream (which I got carded for LOL) was a beer-nut flavor. It was good  though everyone else said it tasted beery...I didn't notice that  which probably indicates the degree to which my taste buds have been trained to ignore the taste of alcohol. Oops.\n",
      "What can I say  it's the best fast food burger out there. They cook them perfectly and dress them very well. There's no grease running off of them like disgusting Five Guys or Smashburger. The fries are great too. Considering this place went from a tiny cart in NYC to locations worldwide in about a decade  I'd say they're onto something.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are going here  I would definitely recommend the Shack stack burger. A beef burger with a veggie patty as well. The veggie patty consists of mushrooms stuffed with cheese. It is amazing. The fries however  are alright they could use more cheese  and they were a bit salty. My husband got the double stack burger  and that was pretty salty as well.  The shakes are amazing though !\n",
      "Shake shack is ALWAYS delicious. I don't know who would give shake shack less than 5 stars. The staff is always friendly - every time I have a dog with me  someone brings out a water bowl without even asking - the service is quick  they have beer and wine!!! and the burgers are a revelation. The potato bun alone should win an award. Also  if you haven't had a peanut butter milkshake  you are missing out on life. Lastly... Not that I would ever choose this over the burger  but the buttermilk chicken sandwich is unreal. I tried it once and haven't stopped talking about it  but I can't stray from the original cheeseburger. Village whiskey is right across the street (also amazing) but I would still pick shake shack every. single. time. I'm obsessed.\n",
      "This was my first visit to Shake Shack. The burger  fries  and shake held up to the hype. I loved the bun which had a hint of sort of sweet Hawaiian taste to it. The only problem with this place is the price.\n",
      "Came here for lunch with my fiancee and friend  found a small table by the window.  they have a great and varied wine selection.  I got a bubbly and my fiancee got some Italian orange soda.  We got the lamb sausage  potato chips  and crab stuffed peppers as \\snacks\\\" then i got the mozzarella with prosciutto bacon bits sandwich which was delicious and savory while being light and healthy. service was prompt and polite.  rustic  intimate  and cozy wine lounge atmosphere with low to medium noise level.  bathroom door lock and handle are kind of confusing to use at first. would definitely recommend for lunch!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tria's employees are very knowledgeable about the selection of beers and wines they offer. This is probably why I look forward to going to Tria. This location has outside seating during the warmer months and is a real treat if you can get a table out there. It always seems to be busy  which is a good thing. I've never had any of the food items at Tria  because the real treat here are the drinks.\n",
      "both locations deserve 5 stars but my favorite location is in rittenhouse . I love the atmosphere :)   Getting a tria card is well worth the small fee its a great way to keep track of the different wines  beers and cheese.  Sign up for the email lists as well they will keep you in the know of all the happenings going on during the week.   Tria has great staff   fantastic cheeses  wines and beers from all over the world.\n",
      "Was wandering the streets of Philly and came across this restaurant.  Realizing I hadn't eaten all day I stopped off to grab a sandwich.  I immediately fell in love with the atmosphere and the staff was amazing and friendly.    Sitting alone enjoying the view  a glass of proseco  and my amazing turkey sandwich  the staff checked in and offered light banter.    Very impressed and highly recommend.\n",
      "My only hesitation to write this review is that it's almost trendy to review Tria  but the biz shouldn't be punished for it...   My mistake is I passed by this place so many times thinking I should stop in  especially since it's packed  but figured the alcohol would be overpriced and food would be an expensive art project  at best. I was wrong.   Rarely do you stop at a place like this. I've been twice and both visits were everything I'd want for a nice  casual dining experience. The first time I went we were the only ones outside (it looked like it was going to rain... and it did). The servers offered to reseat us immediately but we actually opted to sit outside and watch the rain. Everything was covered so it wasn't like our server got drenched coming to our table. I had a salmon sandwich  she had a salad and we shared a cheese plate. Everything was portioned and presented very well. The wine and beer they recommend went with the lunch nicely - we had a great time  so we came back a month later. This visit was equally enjoyable. We sat at the sleek bar for a drink before being shown to our table. I feel this spot is the perfect W. Washington Square casual experience coupled with it's nearby neighbor Varga for the rowdier experience.\n",
      "We came here for dinner on the recommendation of a friend of a friend  who loves it and has been here multiple times.  We liked the idea of ordering a bunch of small plates to share.  It didn't disappoint--everything was delicious and lovingly presented.  We ended up ordering the goat cheese and basil bruschetta (mild but tasty)  figs stuffed with blue cheese and served over prosciutto (rich and pungent)  calimari (which I didn't try)  fennel sausage (tender and flavorful)  two of the cheeses (one was an amazing triple creme  can't remember the other one)  and the chocolate torte.  The cheeses (which are listed on a separate part of the menu--make sure not to overlook them!) are served with sliced bread and are paired with various toppings.  Ours came with fresh honey and some kind of tapenade.         It's somewhat pricey but not exorbitant  which we had anticipated.  The bill came to $80 for five small plates  a cheese board with two cheeses  and two glasses of wine (i.e.  a moderate amount of food for dinner for two people).  You could obviously tweak this depending on your appetite  your budget  or your mood.  It would be a great place to just drop in for a snack.   We ate at one of the cafe tables on the sidewalk  which made for a really pleasant evening.  The service was good but was attentive to the point of being slightly overbearing.  But on the whole this was a very fine meal.  Thank you!\n",
      "I am a frequent Sunday School attendee and Wash West is my location of choice. The staff is amazing  the selection is perfect.   With so many options being available in Philadelphia and so many new places to try  I am still always going to return to Tria regularly. Great beers  cheeses  wine  food  service  everything. Perfect for any time of the day or occasion.\n",
      "This review is strictly of the food. I do plan to come back for wine  though. I ordered the garlic rosemary chips. Although they were only $2  I expected a little more. There were about as many chips as you would find in a lays snack pack! The rosemary was very strong  but I like rosemary so I didn't mind. My friend had the pesto bruschetta. If you love pesto  this is the snack for you. It came with two very small pieces of bread with a small amount of goat cheese but absolutely loaded with pesto. The stuff was dripping off. My friend actually had to take some off because it was overwhelming. The atmosphere at Tría is nice and the staff are relatively friendly. If you're coming for wine and cheese I am sure the experience will be more exciting.\n",
      "Ate on a Saturday around 2 PM - since it was a later lunch there were tons of available tables  which was nice.   Apple Tree Goat Cheese with Basil Pesto Bruschetta - SO good. This one was my favorite of the two we tried.  Pistachio Herbed Ricotta with Lavender Honey Bruschetta - this was my husbands favorite bruschetta - it was also very good!  Roasted Beet Salad - loved it. There was A LOT of goat cheese  so if you don't care for it as much  then ask for them to go light on it. I love goat cheese myself  so it worked out well. It was light  but there was enough to make lunch filling.  Claudio Mozzarella Sandwich - 4/5 stars - really tasty. He thinks it would have been better if the prosciutto weren't crispy since he felt it lost some of its flavor.   Flourless Chocolate Torta - a good end to the meal. Not TOO much - just enough for two people!   This was probably our favorite meal we had in Philadelphia and would definitely recommend!\n",
      "Museum itself was great.  Many great works housed in a huge  beautiful building.  What I didn't appreciate were the thugs that are permitted to hang around in front of the museum by the statue of Rocky.  They were aggressive and very threatening.  Not sure why the museum allows this to happen on their grounds.  Lawsuit waiting to happen.\n",
      "I judge new museums against every other museum I've been to  and the Philadelphia Museum of Art one definitely holds its own. I made a day of it by walking the Schuylkill River Trail to the museum  viewing the collections  and eating a picnic lunch on the lawns outside afterwards. It was definitely not a bad way to spend a day.  The museum spans three floors with collections including American art  Asian art  European art  Modern and Contemporary art  Costumes and Textiles  Arms and Armor  Photography  and Special Exhibitions. The museum is obviously architecturally gorgeous  and from the top of the steps it offers beautiful views of the Philadelphia skyline.  The standouts for me were the first floor's European Art 1850-1900 and Modern and Contemporary Art sections. They contained some little-known pieces by artists like Picasso and Monet as well as a very large collection by Marcel Duchamp  which you just don't see everywhere (or  in my case  anywhere outside of art history books). The second floor's Asian Art wing was also really impressive  with fully rebuilt large-scale rooms displaying a Japanese teahouse  an Indian temple hall  and a Chinese reception hall and scholar's study. These rooms were all completely authentic and unique to any art museum I have ever been to  which give it a more field museum vibe and created a sort of living art experience. I also loved the collection of blue-and-white Dutch tiles and Delft-made ceramics  which I have never seen outside of the Netherlands.   On a ratings note  as a Missouri native I am spoiled by the beautiful and free St. Louis and Kansas City art museums. If the Philadelphia Museum of Art was a free museum instead of a $16-per-person museum (not that it's not worth it!) I would be adding on that last star.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite places to be by myself. I don't play well with others in museums. I enjoy the large open spaces that you can wander through in the museum as well as the connecting grounds that lead to The Waterworks. I've seen a great many exhibits here  having grown up in the area. I am always impressed by the special exhibits that they bring in from all over the world. Some of the highlights certainly include the Japanese tea house and temple as well as some of the iconic Christian art. Of course  no one should miss out on the weaponry exhibit. I really like the new Pearlman Center which recently opened across the street and showcases more modern pieces. Their Japanese Kimono exhibit this past summer was stunning. The whole building receives a generous amount of natural sunlight which is a plus during the gloomy Northeastern winter. I think the docents here do a wonderful job and I always come away from a tour thoroughly informed. The less time consuming audio headsets are equally informative if you rather go it alone. I'm kind of annoyed that they put up a \\Rocky\\\" statue  but at least it's tucked out of the way. I would skip dining in the museum as a meal here can be pretty pricey. Head to one of the restaurants up the road in Fairmount.\"\n",
      "I had a week night free and Philly and this was my entertainment of choice. I lucked out and it was Wednesday so closing time is 8 pm instead of the normal 5 pm.   The collection of American artists is really superb. Most people can recognize many of the main artists.   .... And there's also the steps that rocky runs  up in the names sake training montages. There's a bronze Rocky too.\n",
      "Awesome museum centrally located in the heart of Philadelphia. I knew I had to come when my trip coincided with the \\Paint The Revolution\\\" exhibit. The first thing that caught my eye besides the herd of tourists running up the \\\"Rocky\\\" steps (insert Rocky II motivational music) was the architecture of the building. Stunning. I mean  the Met it ain't but it's beautiful  nonetheless. The highlight of the trip was seeing the paintings of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. My only complaints: The  multitude of art 'experts ' who were clearly lacking in spatial awareness. I didn't appreciate being pressed against some fat guys tits whilst trying to appreciate \\\"The Death of Zapata.\\\" It was almost the death of me. The other complaint  was paying $9 for the Barefoot wine that I usually get on special: 2 for $3  at my local Rite Aid. However  I do recognize that overcharging patrons is the norm when visiting places such as these  and of course I support art (Especially  when I can get loaded in the process). Totally worth the $20 entrance fee and nearly being smothered.\"\n",
      "This museum is HELLA (so Cali of me) big!  We got free tix from my sister's friend and glad we had the chance to visit.   Just from the outside  we took photos imitating Rocky (the move) running from the museum steps. LOL  Cezanne and Beyond exhibition was going on but we need a special ticket for that so we skipped it.  Lots of paintings  artifacts-you know normal museum stuff...but we really enjoyed the Japanese Ceremonial Teahouses/Sunkaraku. Loved the architecture and design. So intricate-I just want to take one home.  When you have @ least have a half a day in Philly-this is a must stop and take in all the history and masterpieces.\n",
      "Audubon to Warhol great American still life  Easy to hear    see very informative come out with a better understanding of still life  Came on Sunday was not as busy as we expected .  A little pricey as we are not members anymore  20$ general admission. 5 $ extra for special exhibit  . Try to come on First Sunday of each month it's pay what you wish  brochure says every wed after five better   But double check because this is Philly  land of the Eagles !! great museum I just feel 25 $  is a little to much for many family's   You can run up the steps in front for free as of today (go Rocky )\n",
      "Amazing special exhibit of impressionist painters! Beautiful work all in one place!  we went to the basement café for lunch and had Mexican bowls- MUCH better than our last trip when we had greasy  cheese steaks and burgers in the other café.\n",
      "Has to be one of the top five Fine Arts museums in the country! If you are visiting Philadelphia and you like art  this is a must visit. If you live in Philadelphia  then I hope you appreciate what you have. The highlights for me where the Japanese tea house  Japanese temple  Chinese temple ceiling and the Hindu temple. My only complaint is that they don't sell postcards of any of the works of art!?!? At least they weren't when I was there today. When I visit an art museum for the first time  I always get post cards of my favourite pieces that I saw. There were at least half a dozen post cards I was looking forward to getting here... bummer.\n",
      "Fantastic museum with something for everyone. I love the events the museum holds  and particularly the \\pay as you wish\\\" admission prices on the 1st Sundays of every month (although it will be crowded  very long lines).   I saw the International Pop Art Exhibit on a 1st Sunday  and it was absolutely fantastic. Not only was the collection incredibly well-curated and meaningful  but the exhibit had plenty of descriptive plaques  and I left feeling that I learned a lot about the art and history of the era/countries featured.\"\n",
      "My friends and I met here for Happy Hour.   Great Space. Great atmosphere.  Good HH deals.  I ordered the Brautwurst Sandwich with sauerkraut which came with mustard on the side.  I really enjoyed the food and the time there\n",
      "This is a condensed review during restaurant week.  First of all  Brauhaus Schmitz  when viewed as a restaurant week deal is nothing short of amazing! The entire ambiance is quite rustic  with cute wooden drawers decorating the walls  larger-than-life murals and waiters walking around in traditional German garments. The food  as least when you order items like the shanks  are well portioned  especially when considering the $35pp. I also loved the beer  especially the flights of beer (ranging from $10-18)  as it allows a non-beer drinker to enjoy an impressive array of various flavors and textures of the classic German beers without feeling overwhelmed.  For the food  I wasn't a big fan of the cheese and beer soup  as they were served luke-warm to cool and the taste just didn't settle in right with my stomach. However  the braised beef stew with carrots and potatoes were perfect for a wintry evening. For the second course  we got the potato pancakes and the red cabbage salad with bacon dressing. I have to be honest  even though the cabbage may have looked incredibly plain  the subtle bacon aroma  especially when bathed with the acidity of the vinaigrette gave the dish a better representation based on its mouthfeel than its visual features. The potato pancake was unfortunately floppy  in both taste  texture and temperature. As for the main dish  I got the pork shank and my wife got the sausages. The shank was definitely neanderthal sized with thick and flavorful chichurons  although the meat was not flavored at all  possibly due to its size. The sausages were alright  but I wasn't too crazy as they were just slightly too greasy. The desserts  unfortunately fell through. Even though we were offered the apple strudels as options  we were told 10 minutes after ordering that they were out. As a result  we opted for the pretzel pudding and the chocolate cake. Both were incredibly sweet and surprisingly very tough in texture (almost like treebark jerky) and we had to dissect the dish just to avoid chipping our teeth.  So  with all this  why the 2 stars? Well  it comes down to service. Our waiter  without going in details just did not do the job right. He was never attentive  hard to pin down  looked at us weirdly during the entire dinner  delivered food for 3 out of 4 patrons at a time with an awkward 5 minute pause without any explanation or apologizes. Needless to say  his behavior and actions single-handedly ruined our experience.  Food: 4 stars Price: 5 stars (for restaurant week) Service: 0 stars Ambiance: 4 stars (the music could be less loud)\n",
      "Great experience  live our server Megan. Love German food choices. Great German wine. Easy parking. Close to South Street Seaport. Make it part of your day trip\n",
      "This place is just flat out awesome. If you're a beer person  they've got tons of different beers bottled and on tap  mostly in the German variety. Some of these are harder to find in the states. And some beers you can get in a liter mug.   For food  it's instant nostalgia if you've been to Germany  otherwise it's just a great dining experience. This is as close to authentic German food as your going to get in Philly. That being said  if you're a vegetarian  German food probably isn't for you (they may have vegetarian dishes  but you'll be limited).   This place is just what you need for a good hearty meal to combat the winter and will have some nice cold beer to refresh you in the summer. One of my new favorites in the city.\n",
      "My bridal shower was hosted here and it was amazing. Not your typical shower because I wanted it to be a \\Jack and Jill\\\" style party and since my fiancé is mostly German this fit our party perfectly.  The private room  food and staff were amazing. They were on top of everything  friendly and accommodating for my guests. All around a great group of people. The food was delicious  came out hot and made sure there was always enough. I could go on and on about how great this place was but I'm hoping you will go and find out for yourselves.  This was my first time there and I can't wait to go back. Thank you so much for making my special day exceed all my expectations.\"\n",
      "Almost an hour wait to get our food on a Sunday afternoon. How hard is to cook sausages?  Being nice  complaining and asking politely why doesn't help get your food any faster. Fail. Won't come back here.\n",
      "I came here via a Livingsocial Adventure and had an excellent time.  The place looks very authentic and the wait staff are extremely friendly.  We got to sample 4 of their draft beers.  The names escape me  but they were all pretty tasty.  We also tried the pretzel and fries.  Both were excellent.  If their brats and schnitzel can match the quality of their appetizers  they will surely make me a frequent customer.  I highly anticipate going back!\n",
      "Awesome German food  great staff. Our server Megan could not of been nicer. Great atmosphere. If you get a chance come on out\n",
      "I'll readily admit  I'm the Colonel Klink of German Bier-Hall expertise.   My German acumen is accumulated from seeing Germany (in Busch Gardens & Epcot)..as well as Otto's in Horsham  Ludwigs here in Philly..and watching hours of Hogans Heroes. So  I am obviously more than qualified to comment on Brauhaus Schmitz.  I am giving them slack  as I am desperate for authentic  good German food and beer in Philadelphia  and they are still fine-tuning.  We had the Sauerbraten and 3-4 half-liters of various biers. The Sauerbraten was dry  yet the spaetzle and sauerkraut were terrific.   The service was quick  the atmosphere very good. We were told the wait for table was 30min  15 min later  we were seated.   We enjoyed the music (although barely audible). The beer selection is great  and rotates. The wait staff knew their stuff on food (although they need to bone-up on their beer knowledge..for us clueless on German Beer).   Gotta hit the Brats and Goulash!\n",
      "I love the concept of this place. It's filled with German beers and all kinds of German food as well. The atmosphere is awesome and the staff professional and friendly. Even though it's obviously more renowned for the beer selection their attempt at making it a sit down dine in restaurant that a family can come in to enjoy is appreciated. I'm letting you know now  this place is all about GERMAN BEER. You will find more varieties and seasonal beers here straight from the motherland than anywhere else in a 50 mile radius. That being said don't expect them to have the alcohol for you dolce leche tini whatever you wanna call it. Staff was easy to get ahold of and if they didn't have a beer they had in their glossary of German beer they were quick to suggest something they had like it. You can get your beers in all kinds of sizes leading right up to pitchers if you're with a group and its still relatively cheap.\n",
      "Had been wanting to come here for a while  since I won't pay Vetri prices for food  and loved the pizza at Osteria. We were a bit diappointed  though. This was New Year's Day at 6pm  so the place was pretty empty. Service was fast and courteous and helpful. Somehow though  it was loud. And though the music wasn't loud  it was classic rock. I'm a fan  but it in no way fits here. Perhaps it's the play between the bar and the restaurant atmosphere mixing in a small space?  Anyway  the food: Swordfish meatballs - excellent Striped bass crudo - good Rotini with wild boar ragu and pears - very good squid ink linguine - good  We expected excellent all aorund  but the prices were in line with the quality. We'll have to try again to give it another chance.\n",
      "We live next door  just moved here and thought we would give Ami's a try for Sunday brunch. I had the hazelnut  maple waffle and my husband had the scrapple with sunny side up eggs. We also had a Bloody Mary and mimosa. Every bite was delicious and the cocktails were superb! We enjoyed the sidewalk table and had excellent service. Looking forward to bringing our friends here!\n",
      "Amis was possibly the best meal ive had in the city in a very long time. It was so good because every aspect of the experience was spectacular. We wanted to try everything because it was so hard to choose just one or two things. So we got about three different appetizers  three anit-pastas  two pasta dishes and two desserts.  That's the way to go!  The veal tongue and octopus were incredible. The papparadell was aldente and melted in your mouth. We got two caraffes of red wine and I topped the night off with a hazelnut chocolate tartufo and a macchiato.  Our bill was so reasonable. I got out of there well under $75 with tip per person.... $75 for all that food!  Our only complaint was our server rushed us a bit. We sat at 8:00 or so and we wanted to sit and relax and enjoy. We let her know we'd be ordering a little at a time because we wanted taste  then decide on our next dish. She was a little put off by that and told us they were busy and we should order all at once. She was very nice about it however  we weren't going to be rushed.  To her dismay we ignored that suggestion and ordered bits at a time anyway.  All in all it was sinfully delicious food and wine  great friends and perfect ambiance to enjoy the perfect company in.\n",
      "I really can't complain about any of the food I had or service I got on the night I came here. When I saw that the average rating was only four stars  I was expecting a good but not great meal. Luckily  I can say I truly did get a great meal.   To start they have a small but well curated selection of local craft beer  so I indulged in a brew from Free Will brewing  which I rarely see on tap. The restaurant was also taking part in Negroni Week when I went  so I snagged some sips of my fiance's drink. It was stiff and very well made made. Honestly based on the ambiance I would say you could come here just for a drink  but you should definitely stay for the food.   For a starter I had one of their meatballs (Sal's old school meatballs that is)  and it was quite tasty. The texture was interesting and the flavors cohesive. When it came to picking a main course I was a bit stumped  since everything sounded good  but their special sounded like a good choice. It was a beef cheek ragu  and let me tell you  it was amazing. The beef cheek was cooked to perfection and nearly melted in my mouth. There were cherries in the ragu which added a lovely tart note to the whole dish  and gave it a somewhat less heavy flavor. I wish it were not a special because I might order it every time! In addition I also got to sample some cacio e pepe  which was equally flavorful despite it's simple ingredients. All the pasta was nicely cooked  a true treat and something you can't always take for granted at Italian restaurants.   This is the point where I talk about what was possibly the best part of the meal  desserts. I ordered the tartufo al bacio and was not disappointed. It was extremely rich but very enjoyable. While the overwhelming flavor of the dish was chocolate the cherries and hazelnuts were what turned this into a phenomenal dish. The taste was perfect  the texture was perfect and the fact that I wanted more was a good sign. Another one of my dining partners raved about his dish  the olive oil cake  and I snagged a taste of it. Let me tell you  this olive oil cake is unique and delicious. The cake itself has a nice chew to it  and the sauces and cream combine nicely to make one perfect bite. It's not too sweet  so those who don't like desserts might actually really like this dish.  Overall I was impressed with my trip to Amis. There was nothing to be left desired and I enjoyed every bit of food placed in front of me. With my closing thoughts I will say that the uniforms the servers wear are a bit odd  their car mechanic shirts are more reminiscent of a gas station than an upscale restaurant. I would implore management to reconsider this choice. Then again  it is just a uniform  and neither the service nor food suffered because of it. I hope to be back.\n",
      "Food: 3.5 stars Service: 4 stars Ambiance: 4 stars Location: 3.5 stars Price: 3.5 stars  Recommendations:  I would recommend starting off with a combination of the bruschetta and salumi for appetizer. The 'imported bufala ricotta and black pepper' is a must have.  The whipped ricotta is so smooth and creamy  it literally melts in your mouth.   The 'mixed salumi' plate is a great addition to the ricotta.  The variety and quality of the salumi is excellent.  The main courses unfortunately did not match the quality of the appetizers.  The initial pasta we ordered was the 'spinach pasta with sausage'.  It definitely was the better of the 3 main courses.  The pasta was very fresh but the sauce was a little flat. The 'gnocchi alla romana with oxtail ragu' was far too salty as was the \\mixed seafood grill' secondi.  My girlfriend who enjoys food on the saltier side was overwhelmed by the amount of salt used in the dishes.  Overall  we had a great time at the restaurant.  The ambiance is great and the service is wonderful too.  The general consensus was that the food did not meet all the initial hype and expectations.  I'm not sure if we will return for another dining experience.  Overall: 3.5 stars\"\n",
      "Amis is quickly becoming my favorite Italian in the city.  I need to keep coming back to try new things  as well as revisit my old favorites.  The cacio e pepe is outstanding. Swordfish meatballs are as good as everyone says.  Squid ink pasta? Yes!    Service is always spot on.\n",
      "I have been to Amis twice now and was disappointed both times. While the atmosphere and service are great  they can't make up for the obscenely small portions and obscenely high prices. The menu is deceiving because everything is priced $10-25  but it takes about 2 of their \\entree-sized\\\" dishes or 4 of their \\\"lighter bite\\\" dishes per person to give you the sense of having actually eaten dinner. Add on a few drinks  and there is no way you're having dinner for two for under $130 there (and you'll still probably go home and break out the cereal). I hate leaving a restaurant feeling ripped off  but that's exactly how I felt both times I left Amis.\"\n",
      "Very unhealthy menu and very unaccommodating in response to a request for healthier versions of their entrees or vegetarian selections generally.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was really looking forward to our meal here  especially after they were rated so highly in Philadelphia magazine.  Unfortunately  it was a complete disappointment.  The only positive thing I can say is that the restaurant has a good vibe.  But I've had much better italian food at our local bar.  For our entrees  we had the gnocchi with ox tail and the papardelle with veal ragu.  Both were fairly bland stew over a bland starch.  Honestly  nothing stood out here.  And they rushed us through the entire meal.  Apps through dessert in 75 minutes.  When I tried to slow down  they just brought another course.  One last bit of annoyance - the waitstaff had obviously all been instructed to recite the same cheesey lines such as \\the artichoke sells out by 8:30\\\" and \\\"the tiramisu has been haunting my dreams\\\" which we heard repeatedly from several servers.  This isn't Fridays people.\"\n",
      "A wonderful restaurant with great ambience  tasty innovative dishes (roasted prawns were delicious and the olive leaves wrapped appetizers were very original and succulent)  but with inattentive extremely spotty and rude service across the board. Were it not for the food quality and general ambience I would have given them 2 stars.   We went there on January 8. A very cold evening.   It was not a busy evening for the restaurant. Their dining room is very spacious. Only a few tables were occupied. After we were seated  we waited for over 15 minutes to even have a waiter come to our table. After we placed the order  we waited for even longer (and our orders were not complicated dishes  see pictures). The service was very spotty as they forgot about some of the dishes we ordered. We had to chase them up.   When serving us  the waiter was extremely rude. He came with our dishes. Dropped them on our table without even making eye contact or saying anything. He kept walking (as he dropped the plates) and just zoomed past our table. It was not as if he was in a hurry to serve other tables  because the restaurant was empty.\n",

      "This restaurant is absolutely stunning. There are a lot of components to the design and layout and I wish I had more time just to look around and appreciate the decor. We came here after my college graduation and were seated at a beautiful table by a window. It was very intimate and allowed for privacy without having us feel like we were forgotten by the staff. Our waiter was very very attentive and friendly but bordered on being a little bit too attentive. The food was great but I think I was expecting it to be a little bit better. I had the business lunch - Octopodi was fresh tasting a beautifully played. The whole fish  Bronzino  was perfectly cooked. The best part of my meal was the dessert - baklava. Overall I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves Greek food or is looking for a really lovely dining experience.\n",
      "Service was a bit slow  but OK. Scallops were delicious. Vegetable salad was completely drained in oil and not particularly good. The place is beautiful.\n",
      "I have been here twice in the last month or so  mostly entertaining friends who like Greek food from out of town  and a few times in the last 5 years also!  Our friends have universally said that the food is good.  The service is consistently professional  and often you will get a friendly  engaging sort of server.  On our last visit  she took care of us  including an old geezer who was cranky.    The Estia chips  made of zucchini covered with a light batter and deep fat fried  are a must.  A light style tzatziki dipping sauce rounds them out.  Estia has a number of classic Greek dishes on the menu  and all that I have tasted are at least passable if not inspired.  It is not easy to make simple Greek dishes divine.  But the best thing to order time after time is a fresh whole fish.  They usually have at least 4 different fishes to choose from.  They will even bring the raw whole fishes out to your table for you to view.  It is always cooked to perfection  simply  with an olive oil and lemon and caper vinaigrette.  The wine list features a lot of Greek wine  and some of it is fairly good.  The prices here are high  and that detracts somewhat from the overall experience.\n",

      "This is one of the nicest looking restaurants I've been to in the city. It feels like an Old World kitchen with a tons of character.  Great place for a rehearsal dinner or big group party since they have huge rooms that close off down stairs. However  the food was just OK. The hummus sampler was just average. My fish was really oily and the vegetables were really mushy and flavorless which was disappointing. The best thing was definitely the pistachio dessert. Overall we had great service  just wish the food was a bit better!\n",
      "This is an excellent restaurant  even for Greece. The food is top notch. The service is outstanding. The atmosphere is cozy. The place is clean and inviting. Menu is a bit pricey  but as far as Greek food goes  it is worth the price.  You will not find better Greek food in Center City  if not Philadelphia. Estia is the BEST. I'm Greek. I've tried them all.  I wish my wife and I could afford to eat whatever we wanted at Estia every single week. We totally would. Instead  we frequent another restaurant owned by the same family  which is less upscale. The food there (Pietro's) is also excellent.\n",
      "I live next door to Yard's so am in there all the time.  Everyone who works there is really nice and cool to talk to.  Beer is awesome - Philadelphia Pale Ale and Love Stout are my favorites.  Food options are somewhat limited  but they are all very good (esp the Buffalo Sausage sandwich).  Free pool and shuffle board  as well as free tours on weekends.\n",
      "I'm a fan of beer and of history  so when we got here and found that much of the Revolutionary series is based off of actual beer recipes that were brewed by the founding fathers  I was very excited to try them.  They did not disappoint  and the other beers we tried were good as well.    But really - this is the beer Ben Franklin was making and drinking?  How awesome is that?  I'm absolutely going to dig up some historical beer recipes for Jason B. to brew at home.  The bartender was awesome  and also gave us great advice on where to go for dinner in the neighborhood.\n",
      "Good lunch. Big  spacious area. We liked the new site. Reasonably priced. Also parking is available. Waitress was great.\n",
      "Definitely come here to try fresh beer! I came here with my cousin because I have never been to Yards. What a great time it was  we tried all of the different brews that they had to offer  and the staff was knowledgeable and very  very friendly. I think Yards is definitely underrated when it comes to craft breweries. They speak authentic and love in the golden deliciousness they brew and deliver to the great people in Philadelphia! I will definitely come back and this time I will bring more people because it is such a great time. I didn't get to try their food  but I plan n grabbing a bite and a pint next time I come there. Cheers!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yards Philly Pale Ale always does me right...tastes awesome  its at most quality establishments  and puts my mind and body at ease. They make a bunch of other great brews: ESA(Extra Special Ale)  Saison  IPA  and Love Stout- Just to name a few. I never got to take a tour of the Brewery  which I heard had a pool table(awesome!)  and unfortunately I don't think I will be able to with the current split and relocation of Yards. One can only look at this in a positive light. Now we have two great local brewers(Yards and Philadelphia Brewing Company)instead of one.\n",
      "A terrible experience. We had seats in the main area at large communal tables  then we're forced in a small windowless room with at least 10 screaming infants  overly inquisitive toddlers and their parents cluttering the walkways with their strollers. BTW this brewery (alcohol production facility) attracts every yuppy and their brats from neighboring NoLibs. The beers are underwhelming for the modern pallette  the food is obviously sandbagged  and their service is overly controlling and minimal in a bad way.  Save yourself some time and money and take a 20 minute train to Tired Hands. Maybe if I wasn't shoved in the side room that could have just been my friends basement that was hosting a mommy and me session I'd have a more positive review.\n",
      "Visiting from California and I have to say  the beers aren't bad in the least! Will gladly come back!\n",
      "I was really looking forward to yards' revamped location on Spring Garden. However  I was quickly disappointed when  I saw that the space was no longer a tap room. It is now a restaurant with a substantial fifteen minute wait for draft orders. Now the eight bar tenders are mostly committed to filling orders at restaurant tables. I did not try the food so I can not comment. Also not that the new space is not bigger. The restaurant is a bit smaller than the Delaware Ave tap room. I can not recommend this location.\n",
      "\n",
      "My cousin decided to have a group of friends at Tequilas for dinner for his 31st birthday before heading out to a few Center City bars.  Truthfully  I've probably walked past this place dozens of times in Rittenhouse without noticing it.  We had to park a few blocks away because it is Rittenhouse afterall.    When we entered there were two young women at the hostess stand who looked bored and not exactly welcoming   but we let them know that we were waiting for my cousin  and we were led inside to a decent bar area.  The style is straight out of Colonial Mexico with nice accents like woodcarvings on the entryways.  We were seated in the back of the restaurant.  Our seats were half-booth and half-chairs.  It was kind of a pain for those of us who were seated eight-across on the booth side.    We ordered specialty guacamole for some of our appetizers.  The bacon guacamole and a crabmeat guacamole were delicious.    I thought my dinner entrée  Shrimp Wrapped Bacon Stuffed with Cheese  was too much on the salty side.  I was glad that I had ordered a sweet drink called the Coco Loco (coconut infused siembra azul tequila blanco  canton ginger liquor  pineapple juice  sugar cane syrup and fresh lime juice) to balance out my salty dinner.  I also got to try the Short Rib (siembra azul blanco infused with jalapeño  fresh lime juice  and pomegranate molasses).  This drink is really good if you like a spicy cocktail!  The servers were very friendly and attentive even with our large party.  I think the best things about this place were the decor and the servers.  When I come back it will be for the guacamole and the Short Rib cocktail.\n",
      "Amazing food  amazing mixology  attentive (but not too attentive) waitstaff  and a beautiful restaurant. If you want to try some updated versions of classic regional mexican cuisine  then Tequila's is for you. Go on the weekends  when they always have 2 or 3 interesting guacamoles which are made fresh to order.\n",
      "Everything except for the entrees was amazing. The drinks were delicious and creative. The staff was friendly and warm. As soon as I walked into the restaurant  I thought  this place is authentic. Instead of the usual Mexican kitsch that looks like Mexico threw up (Distrito  El Vez  El Rey) the dining room was elegant and understated. It looked like any nice restaurant in Guadalajara  not a \\Mexican\\\" restaurant in the US. The staff was jovial. When the staff can tease you for being second-generation immigrant and not a first  I feel like a place is legitimately authentic. However  when our food arrived  it was just ok. Both dishes (Molcajete de Pollo and carne asada with avocado salsa) were bland and unremarkable and lacked any heat. The waiter explained that most of their patrons couldn't handle real Mexican spiciness. I still want to go back to try other dishes but I will be disappointed if all dishes are subdued for a gringo palette.\"\n",
      "The food was excellent  service was excellent and fast. The guacamole appetizer with peanuts was unique and tasty. I had a special of the day - grilled shrimp with crab meat  It was excellent. I ended the meal with impossible cake - flan over chocolate cake - superb!\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice bar  but can be unbearably packed on the weekends.  Their house margaritas really are nothing special (although the jug they come in holds some novelty).  Belly up to the bar and try some of their specialty cocktails/tequila instead. For dinner  be prepared for what can be super slow service. Some entrees are amazing  others are ho-hum. And when you're paying $20 for an entree  you should get better than ho-hum... I prefer the food at Lolita's.   The langostinos (a frequent special) are a unique experience.\n",
      "I was with a  group of 8 for dinner here on Saturday night around 5:30.  It was quiet  but i assume it's because we had early dinner.  The service  atmosphere  food  and drinks were excellent.  I had a shrimp dish and shared empanadas with a friend.  I had a champagne margarita  which was great!  I loved the way the restaurant was decorated-architecture  murals  etc. were beautiful.  I would love to go back here again with my husband for a date night.  I thought the prices were a bit expensive  but the food was great  so no complaints.   Highly recommend!\n",
      "Made a last minute 7:30 reservation on a Friday night.  The place was crowded  but it's surprisingly big  with three different rooms.  First  the margaritas were excellent--my fiance and I had three each.  I hear they do a great sangria too.  The made to order guac was amazing.  We got traditional  but they had a a spicier version and an apple lobster variety too.  The waiter said they switch it up regularly.  The rice and beans here are classically awesome  chicken and steak meals cooked to perfection  and the churros we had for dessert were out of this world (with chocolate  fresh strawberry puree  and caramel dipping sauces).  The service was great  and overall I'd recommend this place to anyone in the mood for some fancier  high-quality Mexican. BTW  if you're in the mood for a more 'hole-in-the-wall' byob spot  try Las Cal Caxuelas up on Girard.\n",
      "Good service for HH! Sit at the bar  drinks are pretty good the food was \\okay\\\" I've had better fundido\"\n",
      "For starters  I would like to say this place is mediocre at best. If any of you out there are looking for great Mexican with a plethora of drink varieties  I would personally choose Distrito or El Vez (both located in Philadelphia) over Los Catrines Tequilas. I say this primarily for 3 reasons. 1) The former two are far more affordable. 2) The former two have much better Mexican cuisine (taste wise). 3) The former two have a much more upbeat environment. If you're looking to class up dinner  then Tequilas is a better option and also if you're willing to delve further into your pockets. The service was okay  but I was a bit astonished when the waiter didn't warn my husband and I about the size and proportions of the food we ordered. That being said  we have enough food left over to feed a small town in Mexico itself. But you be the judge! Happy taco hunting. :)\n",
      "I rarely have bad Italian food  you'd have to be really bad to mess up spaghetti & meatballs  for instance. Pietro's was quite good  I also recommend the risotto balls.\n",
      "Our second night in a Philadelphia hotel we ordered takeout from Pietros -- another Yelp find.  The pizza was excellent and original. It staid plenty hot on the 4-block walk back to our hotel. The salads were great too. I'll return both for take-out and to dine in as the ambiance looked great -- and it was busy \n",
      "Delicious Italian food! Came here with friends when visiting from NY. The single portion of the salad is good enough for 4+ people  and the 13-in pizza as well. We were 6 total and split a small salad  small eggplant parm  and small pizza (Greca- yum!). If we were hungrier we would have needed more  but the food was all very tasty  service was attentive  and the place is spacious-- great for groups. I'd come here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Very good pizza  salad  beer selections. I've been here twice and have thoroughly enjoyed both visits.\n",
      "There's way better pizza in Philly  we're not talking NY quality here but its out there. Don't buy into the Coal Oven hype it's not all that. The cheese is good but the sauce and crust just don't hold up.\n",
      "We had a reservation for a Friday night and let them know we had theatre tickets. The restaurant was crowded and noisy and the service very spotty. The a waitress was great with the drink orders  but it took almost 45 minutes to get the hot appetizers and salads. It seems that to make stuffed mushrooms  a regular menu item  takes a very long time... We then had a pizza and several pastas. The pizza was luke warm and we had to send it back to be reheated. We had to ask the manager to try to get us the food in time to go to the theatre (we were there 1 1 2 hours) It was a very mediocre food experience and a very jarring social one. I would not go back- there are nicer places and with better atmosphere to eat pizza in.\n",
      "Went here solely because I seen they had arancini on their menu. Made a reservation and glad we did because the place was packed. We got there a half hour early but were seated right away.  We ordered the arancini (or risotto balls) and they were good. Not great but good. The risotto and the outer crust were great but the filling lacked one key component-peas---- and the ground meat was almost non existent and the cheese was clumped instead of evenly melted. They tasted good so we ate them. Next we ordered a 4 cheese pizza-this was delicious. I am not big on pizza but this pizza was beyond good-the cheese combo was perfect.  Our entrees consisted of eggplant parm which was mine-it was just fair the eggplant was a little tough but the spaghetti was great as was the gravy. My friends had the rigatoni alla vodka and the salmon which were both yummy.  For dessert we had the ricotta cheesecake  canolli and tiramisu- all three were really good. Service was good and attentive even though they were really busy. One little complaint is that we had to flag someone down to bring macaroni cheese for our pasta. I think you should be asked as soon as your food is served but a runner brought out our food not our waiter.\n",
      "Ok first and foremost  this place is amazing.  Both downstairs and upstairs.  I'll break it down and keep it simple for you guys: -Downstairs: great food  great drinks and beer.   -Upstairs: karaoke  amazingness  great food  drunk people  loads of fun  total party and good specials time to time.   I've never left this place remotely sober and I've never had a bad time here.  I love yakatori boy!!!\n",
      "Came here for drinks and some yakitori with a few friends. I was surprised at the prices of each dish. They were very reasonable ($1.50 - $4 for most skewers).   The yakitori is ordered a la carte  1 skewer in an order. This really allows you to try a large variety of different meats/veggies.  The atmosphere was my favorite part of the experience. The restaurant is set up so you can easily sit with a large group of friends and merrily drink/eat. There's nothing pretentious or gaudy about the place either  which is always refreshing.  Would come back again!\n",
      "This place is very reasonable for private Karaoke rooms. I'd been craving yakitori also  and was pleasantly surprised with their offerings (although they were a bit on the salty side). On the special days (like Sunday when a friend and I went)  an individual room is 15/hour in the early evening  but the fee is waved if you spend 30/hour (as a room  not individually) on food + drinks. Although it was pricey for us  since we were only two people  if you come with 4-6  you could easily spend 30 dollars/hour and have a really fun dinner + karaoke night.   Food is not amazing or anything  but it's solid. I got the scallion/chicken  liver  chicken skin  shishito skewers  rice and a few things of sushi. All good.\n",
      "I've been here twice. Once was for dinner with a friend which was really good. The other to enjoy some drinks and karaoke (not the rooms  just the bar). It was insanely crowded and the karaoke was poorly managed. I'd like to come back to try a room  but I will never go for the bar again. So four stars for the dinner and one star for the upstairs bar=two stars.\n",
      "This place was great on a wednesday night at the bar. Tiger beer is $2.50 and the Tiger roll was $8.00. Large portions  fresh rolled and responsive service.  I had to go back Thursday night it was so good.   Two thumbs up for sushi in Philladelphia.\n",
      "My first time at a yakitori japas place so I don't have much to compare it to. They have an open bar floor area to hang out sing to karaoke. There are some tables on the side as well. $6 vodka drinks - not bad. It's just entertaining to watch people sing... and even better... dance when they've had enough drinks. There are also rooms that you can reserve that looked nice (from what I could see on the outside).\n",
      "I used to come here week after week for the Wednesday $2.50 sushi roll special. We couldn't believe how awesome this deal was! Somebody pinch me!  Then it finally hit me that these rolls were extremely tiny  had only 4 pieces  and weren't very fresh. Blergh. I must have been blinded by the bargain yet again.  I've come here on non-Wednesdays as well and wasn't really impressed with the sushi. The karaoke here is fine  but overpriced. I'd rather go to a hole-in-the-wall Korean place in North Philly or Adobe Cafe for a better time.\n",
      "Yakitori Boy is a great place to hang out  grab drinks  and snack to your heart's content.  The staff here are really friendly and quite attentive.  They check up on you pretty frequently  make sure your drinks are filled  etc.  No complaints there!  The skewers here are delicious  and really  you can't find this food anywhere else in Center City.  If you're feeling more adventurous  you can opt for chicken heart  gizzards  and liver.  But even their more \\ordinary\\\" fare is good too (like their chicken meatballs and grilled pork).    I like coming here on Tuesdays and Wednesdays because of the specials.  On Tuesdays  you are offered select skewers for $1  and on Wednesdays there are select rolls that are discounted.\"\n",
      "Yes...there a many places other then Yakatori Toilet You got to be fricking kidding....Was here long enough to leave!!! Visited yakatori boy because of all the great reviews and rumors of celeb sightings This place is a urinal..As we entered the building with alot of excitement we were  greeted by the over whelming smell of bleach....The unfinished concrete floor had cracks and divots...The table and chairs are old and smelled of smoke   The place is very dark ...our guess was it was to hide all the other inperfections.It reminded us of an old basement night club with the smell of smoke  bleach and split beer We were seated at a table that wobbled because of the uneven concrete floor.The table was dirty and smelled so the server tried to wipe it clean but the cloth she used smelled of old dirty bleach. The only chardonay was canyon road.. A cheap  sweet $3 bottle  Unable to order because of the smell and condition of the restaurant my wife and I got up and left like the place was on fire... Not sure why all the reviews are good... Take my word and do not waste your time to park to visit this  toilet The absolute worst place we have ever visited\n",
      "Came here with my boyfriend last night. Food ordered and rating:  okonomiyaki 10/10 - a sweet and savory asian pancake . Im a sucker for the Bonito flakes and let me tell you...heavy handed. Amazing! Pork gyoza: 6/10 nothing special just your classic gyoza Salmon roll: 8/10 tightly rolled  tasted like salmon nice texture Spicy tuna roll: 8/10 tightly rolled  very well mixed Yakitori combo (chicken meat balls  chicken  chicken heart   chicken gizzard  pork) 8/10: overall impressed I'd appreciate that side sauces be offered though. The heart and gizzard were nicely charred but needed more salt. Pork was amazing. Chicken was good. Whatever sweet sauce is on the meatball needs to be more abundant in my opinion Quail egg and bacon: 10/10 amazing !!!  Yaki onigiri: 2/10: traditionally I understand they are served plain. However  I believe in at least some sort of light seasoning to give the rice depth of flavor.  The sear was nice. I'd suggest in the future adding a rice seasoning option  Service: we came around 6 o clock. Our server was amazing and everyone was very attentive. However we made it clear that we had planned to chill and not rush through our meal. I was given the exact opposite. I felt very rushed. We would have just finished a plate and it was already taken away. We were asked every 15 minutes if everything was ok and if we wanted to order more before even finishing our food. And I would keep reminding them \\were good thank you just taking it slow\\\".  However they were not rude with their approaches. Just to consistent and pushy. Overall experience 9/10 and we will be back\"\n",
      "Fantastic brunches that are a bit pricey but you get what you pay for. Their beer mimosas are apparently a thing here  but I think I prefer regular mimosas. I've also come here for happy hour drinks during the weekday. Great craft beer selection  but the place can get pretty packed.\n",
      "The beer selection here is choice! They occasionally switch up their beer menu  so if you come here alot you will have new beers to choose from. Beer prices can be $5+ to $$9. Your tab can scale up quickly if you are treating people rounds. Its been a minute but i believe wine and wine are comparable in prices. It  a lends closer to the pricer side. On other hand  it is a popular destination for most people and on semi-cold nights the place can be packed since they have a fire pit area outside indoor bar on the top floor.   Overall  it is a chill spot. I would recommend people to pre-game or drink before you head to this bar because of the crowd. You might be waiting for a while for servers to come around. It is not all their fault since it's difficult to be like ten different places at once.\n",
      "If you want a special beer you will probably be happy you came here.  50 beers on tap for a price a little higher then you want to pay. However  if you are interested in good service  good food  or a good place to \\watch the game\\\"  this is not it. Add lots of UPENN undergrads rippin cigs on the balcony and it's definitely meh. The food is RIDICULOUSLY expensive for the quality.. really. The food sucks here.\"\n",
      "Ambience was great  a nice environment to recover from New Years with friends. Brunch specials were delicious with big portions. However  service was slow and they were out of biscuits (had to substitute with an English muffin).\n",
      "City tap has the best of both worlds  good food and good beer.  We sat outside because it was a lovely sunny day and had the pleasure of listening to Splintered sunlight. The beer selection is vast. I had half philly brewing co Walt wit with half lemonade (not on the menu but they did an excellent job making it) and my boyfriend had a Sierra Nevada Kellerweis. We ordered a Chicken Caesar Salad and the Potato Leek Flatbread. The Caesar was delicious! It had Parmesan crisps and garlic croutons and the chicken was grilled really well and was tasty. Our flatbread had a bit of a kick to it. The potatoes were a bit under done for me but were still good anyway.  Our waitress was very nice but when the check came we happened to notice that were charged to split the salad. No where on the menu does it say there is a split charge nor did the waitress give the courtesy of telling us about it so that was a bit disappointing.  All in all it was a good experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "City Tap House is hit or miss from me: When it's good (enjoying a lunch outside or the fire pits outside)  it's wonderful. When it's bad (not getting served for 30+ minutes)  it's really bad.   One of my recent visits to Tap  we were rushed off the fire pits at night \\for a private reservation\\\"...the people WITH the reservation said they were fine to share it and to let us stay. Nope  we were moved to a table. At the table  we somehow couldn't get service although the waitress kept walking by and gave us water? Another time  I waited with a friend for a waiter to come take our order. Most of the time  the wait isn't a huge factor if it's a nice day  but it's a bit out of hand and I'd have trouble recommending it for this reason.  The food is pretty typical  I'd recommend the vegetable bruschetta-consistently good the 4-5 times I've had it. Their salads are also pretty generous and tasty  the burgers weren't my favorite when I've had it. A lot of City Tap is the atmosphere  which admittedly is pretty great.\"\n",
      "So much love for this place!! Every time I'm in Philly  which is usually every weekend and sometimes an additional weekday on top of that  you'll find me at this spot.  And every time  you can find me somewhere at the bar since their bar takes up more than half the restaurant and the vibe is always warm and welcoming.  You would think that being on a college campus  it would be filled with a rowdy young college crowd but it's far from it.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the crowd here.  It's always diverse and friendly.  I can come here by myself and strike up convos with the bartenders or with random strangers at the bar.  Tons of bartenders working on any given day and they serve up the full menu at the bar.  Chris is one of my faves since we share a love of IPA's but they all share a love of beer and of this place as well. **You'll have to keep in mind the time and which day you go since they serve their brunch menu and Sat and Sundays from 11-3pm.  From 3pm-4pm on these days  they only serve pizza and salads and then the kitchen opens up for the dinner menu after that.**  FOOD Recommendations:  - Mezze Plate is an excellent starter.  As a fall/winter seasonal item they switched the original hummus to a Pumpkin hummus. Tasting this at first was a surprise and  might not be for everyone but I truly enjoyed it.  - The Abigail and Pancho mussels are solid.  Huge plate full of mussels and the broth/sauce for either one is really flavorful.  The toasted bread that accompanies this dish is perfect to sop up the sauce.  (You may need to ask for more of this bread lol!)  - Classic Margherita and Tartufo Pizzas are money as well.  That brick oven heat makes the crust with just the right crispiness and the toppings for either are never skimped.    - Brunch Menu Item: Pulled Pork Hash  was alright but too heavy for me.  The man friend ate it up but still commented that it was only mediocre.  And the main reason why I'm always found here is because this is a full fledged CRAFT BEER spot! They have all kinds of events where they feature certain breweries or certain types of beers such as a dark beer event  so their tap menu constantly changes.   You must come in and see their selection for yourself.  It does not disappoint.  Firepits and a large outside patio area make chillen outside accessible all year round.  Take the elevator up to the UT floor and stay for some phenomenal beer  great ambiance and an inviting vibe of chill peeps.\n",
      "This place is a nice twist on the shitty bar scene around the outskirts of Penn.  It's situated in kind of an odd place  with an entrance that's not immediately recognizable as such  and we literally had a tour guide bring us in from the street into the restaurant.  This place is obviously about beer  and lots of it  but you'd be missing out if you don't try some of the food.  Their burgers are huge and tasty  and their pizzas are great too.  Lots of stuff to be had  so don't blow your load on typical bar food  though it's all great.  Huge  open space  and a patio area out back with fire pits.  11-year-old me would have fucking loved this place.\n",
      "Ive been to City Tap house twice now since it has opened. The first time was on opening night. My girlfriend and I sat at the bar and the service was top notch. we had full explanations of beers in question and the bartender was very helpful. I ordered the burger and she got muscles. The food is definetely overpriced  but the burger was good and the bacon was nice and crispy. As for the muscles  well I liked them  but it didnt come with bread in the broth which was a bummer.   The second time we went was tongiht and everything was much worse. We waited about 20 min for a table  finally settling on an outside table for quicker service. the waitresses didnt really seem to know anything about the beers we wanted either. However  they were super friendly and gave good service. The worst part about this time was the food. I got the \\suckling pig\\\" special on fridays and my girlfriend got the grilled chicken salad. the \\\"suckling pig\\\" is NOT suckling pig. It is BBQ pulled pork. MAJOR DIFFERENCE. and I'm pretty sure the suckatash that came with it was frozen or pre packaged  because it didnt taste fresh at all. The chicken in the salad also was completely dry and overcooked which left a plate of lettuce.  So to sum up  this place is good for beers. Go to the bar for better explanations of what your looking for and skip the overpriced food.\"\n",
      "My BF and I visited Philly cuz we wanted to see the liberty bell. We arrived at probably 6am and we were hungry. By chance we happened to park next to Morning Glory Diner. We noticed that it received a lot of awards so we decided to check it out.   I don't remember what my boyfriend had  but I had the breakfast pizza. At first  I was intrigued when I saw it..but when I tasted it...it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I was expecting it to have some tomatoes but it didn't. Instead it had caramelized onions which to me made it taste a little weird...don't get me wrong I LOVE ONIONS but just not this time. Although I don't remember what my BF ordered  all I remember was it falling apart because it got sooo damn soupy! I felt so bad for him because he felt like vomiting.  So all in all  we did not have the breakfast experience we were hoping for but it was a cozy place and the service was ok.\n",
      "Get here early or be prepared to wait. Worth it  though. Great homemade biscuits! Fantastic omelets  pancakes  and French toast. Lots of occasional special riffs on any of the above  like seasonal berry cakes  etc. Sam's is one of my wife's favorites... And she generally hates anything other than a bagel for breakfast!\n",
      "I do not understand the hype of this place. The service is terrible. The seating is cramped. You have to wait forever outside (even in the rain). The food isn't even that good...  Well  except for the biscuits  homemade jam  coffee  ketchup  and pancakes.   Get the grits  the potatoes suck.\n",
      "Why do people love this place so much?? What is with all the hype? I need to know.  I ordered pancakes  corned beef hash  and eggs. Boyfriend ordered some breakfast platter. Nothing was amazing! Well the bacon was amazing... But when is it ever not?  Did I order the wrong thing? I'll give it another go and maybe it'll be a hit. Oh and also plus points for the fact that they were very nice and accommodating for the baby.\n",
      "I could NOT believe that they made us wait outside. My husband decided to be the trooper  I went to the car. The wait was about 20 minutes for two.  My Belgian waffle was somewhat tough and pretty dry. My eggs were good  the cheddar was real cheddar. But the ketchup was a homemade conglomeration of something that tasted a little like barbecue sauce. The turkey bacon tasted like ham. The service was cool. I was sitting about 4 inches from the kitchen door which was constantly opening  giving me a nice breeze (sarcastic- I was cold!) and making me afraid that something was going to come clattering down on my head at any moment.  My husband had french toast - which he loved. I tasted it and thought it was decent. He also loved his coffee- said it was the best he'd had in over a year.  I found the place to be way to noisy - I had to raise my voice to have a conversation with my husband across the table - it got so annoying that I just stopped talking. The service was good. I liked all the homey touches like the signs to be nice  also I thought the 'home on the range/doing time in Attica' metal coffee mugs were really cute.  The bill was reasonable.  I plan to skip this place next time.\n",
      "Only been here once  but we liked it  a lot.  Pancakes were large  good and fluffy  bacon was crisp  fresh squeezed OJ was vg. Fruit bowl had a delicious mix of tasty berries  bananas and mango.  Nice bagels served with enough cream cheese for 2 whole bagels.  Coffee was plentiful and good  nutty tasting. Large container of homemade berry jam on the table.  BUT  maple syrup is extra!  I think it is sad when you serve a great pancake and crappy syrup with them. We would all definitely go again.  Good for smaller groups  it is pretty small inside but they do have a little patio with a couple larger tables. They were very nice people.\n",
      "The retro-diner atmosphere is still the best in the city  if you ask me. I think it's the only thing that keeps me going back though. The last time I was at MG  and that was quite a while ago at this point  I had the breakfast burrito  which I've found to be MG's most consistently amazing meal  was terrible. It was undercooked with runny  wet eggs and was terribly over-onioned. Prior to that  I'd had a few other breakfasts there that were so terribly sub-par from what I was used to getting that I just can't find myself wanting to go there anymore. There are way better options (ie: Cafe Lift and Honey's to name two).\n",
      "the food is excellent might be even better then my beloved honey's. though it lacks that certain it factor that honey's has-meaning i like the staff at honey's better. great mac and cheese  soups  pies  and french toast. I esp love their homemade whip cream it's like a dollop of heaven on top of whatever u r getting. not a huge fritta fan- i prefer a red blooded american omlete w  my potatoes-  but it was also very good. i never had a problem w  the staff like some people have warned me-they r always friendly enuff for me but then again im awesome. if u have a sweet tooth recommend the monkey bread french  toast and pie- excellent.\n",
      "Another great breakfast! It was good but I couldn't finish it  there was no more room.  Yum!\n",
      "\n",
      "Never done this before but ordered take out just for the halo halo dessert.  Worth it.  I'd eat this by the tubful if I could.  The only other restaurant I'd order a single dessert take out would probably be the birds nest from aquavit in nyc.  So good. Get this dessert now.  Oh and I'm sure the savory here is also good based on shared lineage with vedge =p\n",
      "Came here for happy hour with a friend a couple of weeks ago and ended up ordering a tequila cocktail and Sichuan soft pretzels  off the happy hour menu  and the Dan Dan noodles  seitan tacos and Peruvian fries off the regular menu. After reading all the reviews I was most looking forward to the Peruvian fries but they were way oversalted and my least favorite thing. My favorite dish ended up being the seitan tacos - the seitan was seasoned and crisped to perfection  and I need the recipe for the sauce that came on the side because I could seriously eat that every day. The dan Dan noodles were also solid (and spicy  as they should be). The pretzels were just ok  I think there was fennel in them which didn't quite work and the ginger mustard had a bite to it that wasn't all that pleasing  and I'm normally one to love all things ginger. Service was friendly - maybe a bit on the slow side  but I wasn't in a rush.\n",
      "V Street has easily become one of my favorite new spots. I'm not a vegetarian  however  the food at V Street could make me become one (I'm sure my friends would like to hear that!). I came here for lunch and then again for dinner a week later - the lunch and dinner menu is the same.    We tried the following foods:  For starters we ordered the Peruvian Fries and Piri Piri Tofu. The Peruvian Fries were AMAZING and definitely a must have - the large fries come with a sauce that my girlfriends and I were fighting over. The Piri Piri Tofu was good as well  however  I could have done without the chermoula potato salad.    For our entrees we tried the Langos  Dan Dan Noodles  and Korean Fried Tempeh Reuben. The Langos were similar to a fluffy fried dough topped with smoked beets and sauerkraut.  It was pretty good but small.  The Dan Dan Noodles were very yummy (on par with Hans Dynasty) and nice and spicy! I would say that the Tempeh Reuben is the most filling of the dishes - I was actually surprised how full I was afterwards.   For cocktails we went with the happy hour menu and got a drink made with vodka and thai iced tea.  My only suggestion would be to add a cocktail to the regular drink menu that has vodka.  The ambiance is nice. The restaurant was actually bigger than I thought it was going to be (it's quite long). It has a nice big window in the front with seating  more seating in the back and then a large bar in the middle.  The service was good as well and the servers were knowledgeable.\n",
      "I wanted to love this but the portions were SO SMALL. We got Kung Pao noodles and tacos  and it wasn't enough  at all. The no-alcohol mixed drink I got was great though. It was like a Portugese twist on an Arnold Palmer  very refreshing. Wait staff were fairly attentive.\n",
      "I went here with friends. I wasnt sure what to expect as someone who eats meat but i have to say the food was amazing and flavorful!! The places is small is cozy. We tried the tempeh tacos and they taste similar to fried chicken and usually i would have to add stuff to flavor but the tacos didnt need anything it was very flavorful. We had 3 people but the tacos come in 2 but they let us add another.   For dessert we tried the asi kacang  very flavorful with so many different elements!! It was amazing! I absolutely loved it!! This place made it to the one of top of food in philly!\n",
      "Street food - what a great concept for a vegan restaurant. I didn't care for the Peruvian fries  which was the only dish that we left unfinished in a party of five sharing dishes. The piri piri tofu and the langos were excellent  but the Korean tacos were the best!   The only negative  the space has weird acoustics  the sound reverberated and we could barely have a conversation or hear the waitress. I imagine when the place is not packed for lunch this wouldn't be a problem.\n",
      "I've been thinking about their chile noodles every day since coming here last week. Super flavorful  and hits that sweet spot of vegan food that's actually filling. Stole a bite of my gal's ramen too  also pretty tasty. I recommend getting a drink with their house made ginger syrup as well! Pretty inexpensive on top of that.\n",
      "\\Great flavor! But be aware that portions are small. Desserts were subpar compared to main\\\"  Noodles are surprisingly luscious without any animal products. Harissa grilled tofu is also tasty but it won't be filling. Very tasty mains.  Fries app was fine. Crispy exterior with flavorful toppings but they are potato wedges so the inside was just bland baked potato.  Desserts were not as exciting. The soft serve of the day was Cuban coffee and it was good but nothing noteworthy. Waffle with ice cream and chocolate drizzle was fine but again nothing noteworthy. And sweet potato parfait was again unimpressive.\"\n",
      "Really enjoyed the drinks and the bar. Food was excellent (as expected from this Chef and his legacy at Vedge.)  The Shishito and two types of tacos were standouts.\n",
      "Raving about this place! Came here on a Tuesday night with a friend around 7:45pm without reservations and was seated in less than 10 minutes despite how packed it was. My friend is vegan and I'm vegetarian so we figured it'd be a good choice for dinner.  We ordered the Peruvian fries to share- delicious! This dish is bigger than it looks in pictures because there are fries underneath the three big ones I've seen in pictures. I was hesitant to try it because ahi is spicy but the flavor was so rich and truly amazing.   I ordered the miso butter noodles  which the waitress recommended as a decently filling dish that was not spicy. And yes it was filling and delicious! The noodles tasted buttery but not over the top  and the scallions and ginger flavor balanced it out.  My friend felt very full after eating the Korean tempeh tacos. Even though there were only two tacos  they were decently sized and she said the tempeh was very filling. If you do not like spicy food this is probably not the dish for you.   For two entrees and a shared item  we paid $36- not bad! Considering the immense flavor and rich taste of the food it was worth it. Our waitress and all the staff were very friendly and accommodating too. Definitely coming back for more!\n",
      "The food is actually not bad.  The beef cube are normally tasty except sometimes they get lazy with the cutting and its not a cube anymore.  The BBQ quails might be the worst quails I have ever ate.  The reason for the one star is because there are actual mouse running around the place.  We would have took a picture of it but it ran under the table the first time and the 2nd time we saw it  it ran up the windows and never seen again.\n",
      "Great for pick-up  although I don't think they do delivery.  We wanted cheap but quality Pho and found it at Nam Phuong.  Pick up was easy - plenty of street parking nearby and they had everything ready within 15 minutes.  For takeout  they put all the ingredients for the pho into separate bags/containers.  Great idea so that your sprouts and noodles don't get soggy  and you still have a lime wedge on the side.  We had various meat (beef  etc) phos and they were VERY good!  Nam Phuong makes a great broth to start  and the rest is excellent quality.  Can't wait to go back for more.  (Although  I'll skip the spring/summer rolls next time and just go for the pho  which in and of itself is a big portion and very filling).\n",
      "Nam Phuong has barely ever let me down.  its food and service are always consistent.  I suggest:  Vietnamese spring rolls. Ca Kho Tho (Fish in Clay Pot) Bo Luc Lac (Beef with Watercress) Sweet and Sour Soup Soda Chanh  Those are my usuals.  If i ever have a hard time thinking of a place to eat on Washington avenue i can always rely on Nam Phuong!\n",
      "I had a hard time finding a good Vietnamese restaurant in philly. Compared to other places I've been to  this would rank in the middle of the pack or the lower bottom. Big menu selection and food was decent.\n",
      "Good food  quickly served and hot out of the kitchen.  Service is attentive and mostly impersonal.  Reception is awkward (non-existent) perhaps because there are 2 entrances and the staff must see you seeking a table.  We chose a table and got a brusque \\wait over there\\\" as we waited for it to be cleared.  Spacious  casual  clean setting.  Light background music was more appropriate for a dance exercise studio.   The \\\"wen yu\\\" fish in clay pot was excellent  with a savory sauce similar to that used with sushi broiled eel. Only 4 pieces but high quality.  The charcoal grilled pork and shrimp with broken rice was tasty and good. Vegetable lo mein was tasty  vegetables slightly too oily.  Parking can be a challenge  though you might get lucky to park in the strip mall's lot.\"\n",
      "Two of my favorite dishes in the city are here. Raw beef salad and the beef wrapped in grape leaves. Lots of places do them  but few like this. Plus it's fast  cheap and good for groups. Come here!\n",
      "There's a reason why I am overweight... I live near such great places like Nam Phuong. I was introduced by my vegan and vegetarian friends Kathy and Chris  so there is something for all of us :)  I found this crazy value to be full of flavor  well-priced  fresh and with lots of choices. May I recommend the chicken sauteed with lemongrass  curry & coconut sauce. MMMM good!  Vietnamese Chow the way I like it: simple  spicy and savory....pho REAL!\n",
      "\n",

      "This is a family favorite of ours  good  filling  Vietnamese food that won't break the budget.\n",
      "You don't come across vegan fish tacos too often  so Bar Bombon's tacos de pescado are especially fantastic. Excellent service  great location right by Rittenhouse  super fresh ingredients prepared expertly. A little on the pricy side  but fortunately this time my meal was on the company dime.\n",
      "My husband and I came here the weekend before Valentine's Day. We were seriously impressed with the food. We started with chips and guacamole (classic - chips weren't too salty  which was ice)  then the mushroom empanada (delicious)  buffalo cauliflower tacos (yummy) and finally the cubano sandwich (I'm already craving another one - SO AMAZING). We finished by having the tres leches  which was really rich. The cake itself was a tad dry but it was still great  especially with the coconut shavings and coconut cream on top. Highly recommend checking this place out!\n",
      "\n",
      "We liked this place so much that we went twice while visiting Philly  and even brought two other folks. Delicious margaritas  and every dish (cauliflower tacos  Spanish Meatballs  breakfast flatbread) was brimming with so much flavor that I found myself exclaiming this out loud (sorry next door guests).  The staff is very helpful and friendly  and the atmosphere makes your time at Bombon feel special too  without being pretentious at all. Very comfortable place  and delicious food. We'll be back.\n",
      "My wife and I are vegetarian but not vegan though we use our trips into Philly to try and explore new vegan options because in our own small city the nascent plant-based dining scene is still very limited. Bombon in that regard was a treat. We were not prepared for it to be a small-plates restaurant and I don't know that I would have chosen it had I known it was. The server mentioned this was a change so maybe it was recent? Either way it should not distract from my appreciation of the food.   The first course we ordered was the Hearts of Palm Ceviche. This was tougher than a fish civiche I am sure but the heat and acidity of the sauce was odd and addictive and well paired with the mild palm. The Spanish Fries were good but nothing special. We got them primarily out of interest in the vegan cheese which was very good. The tacos we got  fish  and others seemed like the real winner on the menu. The \\fish\\\" was clearly a tofu but it tasted and had the texture of a whitefish. Final course was a Tofu steak in a Spanish tomato and pepper sauce. While never fooled that the tofu was not beef it seemed to be purely a vehicle for the excellent sauce.   The drinks were good but not above ones at restaurants in a similar class but we did not have margaritas which seemed to be a big draw. The desert was a coconut custard with a chocolate hazelnut crust and a citrus fruit foam. The foam was very tart and I only wish there was more of it to enjoy.  If I were to go again I think i would have just loaded up on the tacos and/or empanadas which are more bang for your buck versus the rest of the \\\"small plates\\\" racket.\"\n",
      "Simply delicious vegan food. Got the nachos and they were simple  but SO flavorful. And I didn't feel gross after eating them. Their cheese and sour cream tasted very real but it was fully vegan! Totally would come back to try more stuff. Central location and they've got a bar up front. Waitress was nice and not overbearing. Great experience here.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short: Trendy  a bit expensive  small portions  but oh my GOD when they get a dish right they get it RIGHT.  The cubano sandwich and the fish tacos were by far my favorites. I don't think I've ever had a better sandwich than that cubano. If you're like me and you've never had faux fish  give those a try  too. The loaded potatoes were extremely flavorful and delicious as well. The mushroom empanadas were disappointing  but I chalk that up to personal preference. We got fries with the sandwich  and they were okay  nothing special.  The bill for 4 plates and one drink was in the realm of $50. My friend and I arrived hungry and left stuffed  so the portions-- while smaller than average-- weren't a problem for us.  You may want to err on the side of getting reservations rather than walking in. They were short on openings when we arrived  as most of the tables that were empty were being held for reservations  and we almost had to wait.  Recommended for anyone who likes tasty food :)\n",
      "Went here with coworkers and it seems the best time to go is for brunch which is from like 11am-3pm if you want food. We missed brunch by like 20 mins because the seating area is small and we had to wait for a table but still enjoyed drinks at the bar  which were good and strong while we waited. Buffalo Cauliflower tacos were on point! Two of us had the Cubano Club which was filling. Definitely a nice Vegetarian Vegan spot  and good music. Definitely would go again\n",
      "This is such an amazing new restaurant in Rittenhouse. Everything on the menu is plant based  but don't let that deter you. The menu is fresh and enticing  I really wanted to order everything on the menu. I went there for lunch and the place is comfortable and bright  a great change from the dreary January weather. We walked in and were immediately seated. We order the fresco guacamole and chips to start. The guacamole was so fresh with big chunks of avocado. I ordered pescado tacos and chick'n empanadas. My mom ordered a barley and bean soup and sweet potato salad. The pescado tacos were amazing. The crunchy \\fish\\\" paired with a slightly spicy sauce and avocado really made for an amazing meal. The beans and rice on the side were delicious  this could really have been a meal in itself  but we wanted to try everything on the menu. The empanadas were perfectly cooked and came with two different sauces. The highlight of the day was the barley and bean soup. This soup came in a large shallow bowl and was so amazing I wish I could have pints of it to freeze. It had big chunks of avocado and carrots in a light broth. The service was great  everyone was very personable and talkative  it was an amazing experience and I can't wait to go back.  Definitely check this place out!!\"\n",
      "Top notch food. I ordered the 3 course meal and everything was beyond super deliciousness!!! Our waiter Jenna was amazing  knowledgeable and fun. She made our experience sheer perfection. I can't thank the staff enough for making my birthday dinner heaven on my taste buds.\n",
      "\n",
      "First place I ate in the area and it was sooo good. My friend and I both ordered pasta  but the pizzas looked good from afar. They have beer and wine available which is great when you don't have time for byob.\n",
      "Omg! Omg! Omg! What a hidden gem! I'm disappointed I didn't take pics but the food AND service was amazing!! I forgot my servers name but she was very helpful and so attentive as I arrived earlier than the rest of my party (one other person) she kept checking up on me to see if I needed anything. Once my friend arrived the server then explained the menu to us bc it was our first time. She recommended the steak tartar in a jar and we ordered two pastas. The lamb and the seafood. Although they are small portions  we were stuffed. The steak tartar was my favorite  I honestly dream about it  it was that good served with crunchy soft bread. Everything was very on point at this place! Will def visit again soon. And there's a parking lot! A great plus for me bc I hate driving around looking for parking\n",
      "In Riva never disappoints. The food is delicious (mamas meat balls  polenta  duck ragu & pepperoni pizza are some of my favorites)  the waitstaff is always great and the atmosphere is perfect (both indoor and outdoor).    Last night we ordered a 4 course tasting menu and it was amazing. Everything their kitchen puts out is a masterpiece!\n",
      "On the banks of the river ... is the best pizza I have ever eaten  period.  Its as much about the crust as it is about the balanced accompaniments.  A thin but delicate crust with rewarding texture and flavor that offer meaningful contributions to the topping interplay (rather than delivering toppings in an after-thought  unremarkable  edible vessel).  The perfect meal so far ... - VASI - Ceci Beans and Lentis (tomato scapece  grana padano) - ANTIPASTI - Aggrodolce Pork Ribs (green apple  pistachio) - LE PIZZE - Spicy Ham (coppa piccante  san marzano tomato) - DOLCI - Zeppole (blackberry yogurt  lemon curd)  Honorable mentions and amazing seconds if you can manage ... - VASI - Cannelini Bean Aioli (smoked pepper  arugula  sicilian tuna) - ANTIPASTI - Carciofi Fritti (fried artichokes  lemon yogurt) - LE PIZZE - Quattro Formaggi (ricotta  scamorza  marinated tomato) - DOLCI - Cannoli (pistachio  lemon-ricotta  chocolate-olive oil).\n",
      "If you consider the reasonable prices  the beautiful location and the need for such an establishment in this area I have to say this was a five star experience. The service was smart and easy going with our two year old son. She comped us an app when our drink order took an unusually long time and she ran down her list of favorites for us twice. We ordered 8 things on the menu and not one was average or just satisfactory  everything was delicious. My favorites were the octopus app and the asparagus app. So good.... cherries and truffles yum yum yummy.\n",
      "Service  parking and location was great. Pizza and salad had great taste. It came out quick and was timed perfectly as we had to get on the road. Dough was okay - hard to eat with toppings falling off pizza\n",
      "Just went to In Riva for the first time. I had heard they had a dog area and wanted to enjoy the evening with my Benny. The Pizza-n-Puppies area was great. The tables were  a little low (dogs could easily reach if they wanted) but considering I've never seen something like it before  I really liked the concept.   I had the Mushroom and Zucchini pizza and it was alright. The crust was amazing  but I didn't know the pie would have a kick and I truly dislike spicy. Next time I know to tell them no spice and they'll leave it off. I think without the spice the pizza would be great.  UPDATE: I have been to In Riva a few times since writing this original post. Just say don't add spice and the pizza will come out amazing. At least  if you're like me and don't like food spicy.  Check their Facebook page before heading out on a Tuesday because you need a password for half price pizza.\n",

      "Love  love  love the hummus here! Always combined with healthy toppings and served with amazing pita. Minus 2 stars for the eat-in seating. Always freezing cold inside  dark and dank. Borders on unpleasant.\n",
      "Go here! For around $10  you will get a delicious hummus plate complete with Israeli salad (and of course  pickles!)   I believe their hummus flavors rotate  but on the day I went  they had around 3-4 to choose from. I settled on beet/sunflower and was pleasantly surprised by the smooth taste.   I'll definitely return  especially since they have some outdoor seating so I can work on those tan lines!\n",
      "Wow  this place was great. Came here with a friend and was intrigued by the funky interior  only to be further pleased by the excellent food! I had the lentil hummus and my friend had the beef one. Both were super flavorful  creamy  and light. The pita was soft and super warm. Perfect! Limonadas were great too. Definitely will go back :)\n",
      "Fantastic and creative combination of hummus spread around a bowl  with a center of oil and the \\entree\\\" part of the dish. All of this is also accompanied with a hot foil of fresh  pillowy pita bread. I had a beef brisket and potatoes  and everything was perfect. The hummus was extremely creamy  and the brisket was tender and flavorful  combined well with the brothy potatoes. The pita bread was also the best I've had so far.   I didn't imagine I could make a meal out of a hummus dish  but by the end I was pretty full. The side pickles and salad were great as well  and definitely take advantage of the additional jars of toppings at each table to explore more ingredient/flavors to the dish.\"\n",

      "Shut the front door. This place exists?! I'm stunned I didn't know sooner. I wish I knew before lunch! Now  I'll have to wait...I'm giving Dizengoff five stars before I go  because I've had Zahav's hummus and it's amazing!!!!! My day = made .\n",

      "f* GENO's  f* PAT'S and f* JIM'S!   SERIOUSLY! Go to Ishkabibbles! They actually mix in the fixings you want in with the meat so each bites get a bit of everything. They also cook up the mushrooms and bell peppers with your meat so it's not cold out of a can (yuck for jim's). They have good fries options too! Quality bread compared to other joints and you don't feel like you're walking through an assembly line.   When back in Philly  I'll get my cheesesteak fills here at Ishkabibble's!\n",
      "My wife and I wanted to try a great cheesesteak from Philly but did not want to deal with any of attitudes or rude service.  After looking through Yelp  we settled on Ishkabibble and were not let down.  The parking in the area may be an issue but we were able to find parking right away (call it luck!).  We were able to go in and look through the entire menu without feeling rushed or being given any dirty looks.  We decided to go for the South Philly Cheesesteak (peppers  steak  provolone) and it was very delicious.  I really wanted to try the original cheesesteak but we were told that one cheesesteak can feed two people (glad we were told that).  To drink we tried the Gremlin (Grape Juice and Lemonade) and it was amazing.  We would go here again in a heartbeat and try the original with whiz.\n",
      "My fav place to get hoagies in philly  I have had pats and ginos and they dont compare. i guess it depends on what you are looking for. 2 Thunlbs up and 5 stars for this place.   I wish they had more room to eat-in as  I don't live here and I need to eat my food as soon as I get it. and the Gremlin yes!  Chicken cheesesteak is great and cheesesteak is great. I also like how you can add brocolli or veges if you want to. I personally am a meat and cheese and bread person. But the option is there. check it out they shouldnt dissappoint.\n",
      "Cheesesteak was decent  but I don't see what all the fuss is about. I'll try them again when I'm in Philly and give them a second shot.\n",
      "Yummy! I have heard so many great things about the food here  but I always think it is best to taste things for myself.  Gremlin? Check. Cheese steak with american? Check. Yummy! Now this is good cheese steak.  You should check this small hole in the wall out  but try to go early.  It can get pretty busy late nights.\n",
      "Kinda dry  but I still liked it. Quick service  unlike a place across the street  and overall pretty good. Not great  but the fries were really good and the \\gremlin\\\" drink was perfect on a hot  humid Philly afternoon.\"\n",
      "Yes! Ishkabibbles is THE best place for cheese steaks. After having Jim's twice now  Ishkabibbles wins everytime. Their sandwiches are so flavorful you don't have to season it at all. You take one bit and it's euphoric. It is small as heck though and can get super crowded at times.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is great.  hole in the wall atmosphere.  Every time I come to Philly I visit this place.  You walk in and sit at the bar and chat with the guy who seems to be always working there for the past few years I've visited.  He tends to tell you odd things about himself there  but the cheesesteaks are awesome.\n",
      "Have to describe my most recent experience here as overly disappointing. Came on a Philly summer Friday night and told a 20 minute wait for an outdoor table. This ballooned into 45 minutes due to lingerers so not the hosts fault but he could have been apologetic as he watched us sitting on the bench outside patiently waiting.  Nonetheless a solid meal could have redeemed this start but throughout the meal I was left feeling underwhelmed. The salmon grilled flatbread was a true disaster. The fish was not fresh at all and the matzo-ish bread was burnt which killed any chance to enjoy the hummus. Luckily the mussels were as delicious as I remembered from my last experience although trying to get extra bread from the waiter was a job in itself. For an entree I went with the pork chop which I am a big fan of and it was a solid piece of meat but really was skimpy on the apple butter which is  my favorite part of the bite.  With so many great BYOBs in the city this experience definitely took Audrey down a few notches and out of my goto rotation for the immediate future. This is a great neighborhood spot so hoping it was just an off night  such a shame.\n",
      "This place is definitely delicious and had some fantastic items on their menu including the mussels (the broth was just EVERYTHING).   I like that it is small and attempts the cozy feel  but I was having trouble being cozy as it was CRAMMED. I felt like I was sitting on top of the tables on either side of me and it was just really difficult to get comfortable.   BYOB is the way to go and that's the best part because it's usually the drinks that really weigh a dinner check down. I had a great time here but it only gets 4 stars because I felt like I was eating dinner with everyone as opposed to just being there with my bf. Too crammed.. maybe take out some tables?\n",
      "Have been here a few times and I have nothing but good things to say about Audrey Claire. First off  the waiters waitresses are super knowledgeable and personable. The food is also awesome and not too pricey. My personal favorites are the sprouts with shaved parmesan as an appetizer and the pork chop as an entree. I also like the fact it is BYOB.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros  it's an intimate setting to share with friends  as well as getting a peek into their open kitchen. Cons  it is rather noisy and the food  while all were presented well  not all were seasoned equally so.\n",
      "We have been coming to Audrey Claire for years and have always enjoyed it. We visited last night for the first time in several months and the first time since new ownership took over. We were not impressed. Some of the best items that have been menu staples for a decade are gone (Mediterranean dips  rack of lamb) and other items have clearly taken a slide in quality as some sort of cost cutting measure.   My boyfriend ordered the pork chop  which was previously a duroc pork chop about 2 inches thick. The duroc has been removed from the menu and replaced with some sad little imposter that was dry and flavorless. I ordered the short ribs  which I don't think I've ever done before. What I got was a plate of stew that had likely been cooked in a crockpot. The vegetables were obviously frozen and from a bag and the short rib was doused in some version of south Philly red gravy. Not appealing.   We will return and hope this was just an off night  but because of the new ownership  we fear this may be the way of the future.\n",
      "this is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in philly.  not only is the food delicious  the ambiance is also super pleasant  not to mention it is also BYOB with a beer store right across the street (talking about convenience!).  i've tried many dishes here and the food just never disappoints.  the flat breads here are just amazing  especially the pear with sunflower seeds one (this is a MUST! and i melt every time i take my first bite of it) and the braised short rib one.  the brussel sprouts  the butternut squash risotto  and the tiger shrimp with baby arugula salad are delicious.  the brisket entree was so juicy and tender.  if you like mussels  you can get an order of (2-lb) mussels  which can be easily split for 4 people as appetizer  or  in my case  have it all to yourself.  the place itself isn't big  but it's got great ambiance - very open  high ceilings  and bright (white walls with sunflowers as decor).  they have an outdoor seating area that is open during the warm seasons  which makes the dining experience even better.  2 things to note  the place does get LOUD especially during dinner hours  and it's CASH only.  other than that  enjoy!\n",
      "The first of many reviews I will give for Philadelphia area restaurants. Having read reviews of Audrey Claire on Yelp.com I decided to finally make my way to the restaurant. Living 5 minutes outside of center city I have to drive to the restaurant which ended up being very inconvenient. I drove around for 20 minutes trying to find parking. If you live in center city it is ideal to take a taxi to the restaurant.   The area is by Rittenhouse Square and is very lively. There are a ton of restaurants within that block. Our party of three ended up getting to the restaurant at 10:40. The dreaded late night customer! The server who handled us couldn't have been more gracious. She sat us and did not rush our table nor give us any attitude while we ate.  The interior is very simplistic. The walls are painted with very light tones with fantastic lighting throughout. The kitchen is open for all to see which always makes for a pleasant dining experience. The aromas of the kitchen open and extend throughout the restaurant.  The crowd seems to be 20-30s crowd all well dressed and attractive. There is enough space in the restaurant that sounds do not seem to echo so you can have a nice conversation without having to scream to hear the persons at your table.  The servers dress was very casual. Our server was wearing some cut up jeans and a sleeveless undershirt. She was fairly knowledgeable with the menu with the questions we had.  We were a bit rushed with ordering and the presentations of our appetizers and entrees but as is to be expected since we go to the restaurant 20 minutes before the kitchen was closing. I normally like to have a 5-10 minute breathing period between appetizers and entrees. It allows the customer to talk about what they just ate and to digest their food in anticipation for the entree. There was no wait period as soon as we finished our appetizers the entrees were presented. Some people may like this but I do not.  Before appetizers are brought out we were given a basket of warm pita bread with oil for dipping. I always prefer oil to butter. It is healthier and tastier in my opinion. The oil was VERY mild and had almost no flavor. Perhaps some spices could improve the dipping sauce.  For appetizers as a table we ordered the grilled flat bread spicy hummus  smoked salmon and mesclun w/ tahina vinaigrette. A lot of times anything that includes smoked salmon has trouble competing with the overpowering flavor and taste of the salmon. Not the case here the hummus blended perfectly and the mesclun and vinaigrette was very mild and was a nice touch.  We also ordered the Mediterranean spreads. You have a choice of seven spreads. We chose the spicy hummus  sun dried tomato & garlic and the baba ghanoush. All were good but nothing amazing and not in the same ballpark as some Mediterranean restaurants ive been to when comparing the two. It also came with pita bread. I recommend the sun dried tomato of the three.  For entree I ordered the potato crushed ahi tuna topped with crispy beet shavings. The potato was very mild but the tuna was cooked perfectly. I had mine medium rare. It was not the BEST I ever had  but it was damn close. Perfectly done.  We skipped on the dessert as it was almost midnight and the servers were beginning to clean up. We were not rushed nor did we receive any of the dreaded \\hurry up\\\" stares from any of the servers. We enjoyed our wine without any rush and ended up leaving at about 12:15.  Overall I would give the restaurant a 3.5. I think the hype the restaurant received was a bit of a letdown  but given the time we entered the restaurant could have played a part in the delivery of services. I don't see myself going there again for dinner for awhile  but find it to be ideal to go to for lunch or a sunday brunch. Especially in the spring and summer when it is warm out with their outdoor seating.  If you want a great meal with no frills attached I suggest Audrey Claire. The attention is solely on the food and this is why the restaurant works!\"\n",
      "This is one of my all time favorite restaurants  serving some of the best meals I've ever had. Everything is fresh  flavorful and simply delicious.  For one of my many visits  I came for a birthday celebration with a party of 12 and they accommodated us well with a prix fixe menu featuring family-style appetizers and desserts. We didn't feel rushed and everything was just as good as when you order off the normal menu. All in all  it was a great night out.\n",
      "Audrey Claire is a hidden gem! I came here on a Sunday night with a couple of friends and the food was incredible. We ordered the antipasti  which I highly recommend  the pear flatbread and bread pudding for dessert. Everything tasted fresh and the service was quick. Since it's a small place  I recommend going early and definitely trying the antipasti if you want a healthy way to start your dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is great! So far  the main dishes I've had are the pulled pork  pulled chicken  salmon  & wings. The smoky wings - life changing. Wow! The brussel sprouts with bacon are my favorite side.  Everything is always soo tasty. The only disappointment to me was the actual corn in the corn bread. But I'll forgive them and just remember to never order that again.  The prices are very reasonable. So glad that I live only 5 minutes away from all this bbq wonderfulness.\n",
      "Went to lunch here for my second time. As a born and raised North Carolinian ( REAL bbq country) was elicited to try something new to me.  Wow! I was impressed both times.  Great pulled pork !!! Great sides as well. 2 come with the sandwich.  Sat in the full service/bar area.  Was waited on by a very  very pretty and attentive your lady. GREAT service on a busy Friday at lunch.  Will be back many more times.  Can't wait to try the all you can eat buffet!!!  Love this place!!!  5 stars\n",
      "All is all good bbq. I didn't like that the brisket was pulled  I enjoy brisket slices but the ribs were cooked well and the sides are great! Try the creamy spinach!  The pulled pork had a good smoke ring on it and all the meat had good flavor. I will try the chicken the next time I go.\n",
      "Best ribs  great service. The inside looks even better after the remodel. Never had a bad meal there. I always get the mac and cheese and baked beans. Pulled chicken sandwich was great. Friendly staff and short wait times for your food.\n",
      "This place is soo good. I usually get the kids meal with the half pulled pork or pulled chicken sandwich with a side of the mac and cheese or the cole slaw and a piece of cornbread. The last time I visited I got the full-size meal to see what it was like and it was huge! You get two sides plus a full size sandwich and that was way too much for me to eat in one sitting. I'm sticking with the kids size meals for now on. Would definitely recommend Sweet Lucy's for lunch if you work or live in the area. The service is quick and the food is delish. I've never gone for dinner  but I've heard they have a buffet on Monday nights which sounds pretty awesome. If you want BBQ  go to Sweet Lucy's. You'll be happy you did.\n",
      "What can I say... it's the best BBQ I've had thus far in the Philadelphia area and well worth the trip if your looking for real SMOKED BBQ. Made my first trip this past weekend and wasn't quite sure what to make of it as it sits alone in a warehouse district of off 95 in the Mayfair area but as soon as you smell the \\SMOKE\\\"... yum! Loved the ribs  smoked hot wings  grits  collard greens  cornbread  sauces... the brisket was really good too (but I prefer mine sliced not chopped). And the blueberry-peach crisp is worth going for alone... can't wait to try their bourbon bread pudding.   \\\"Why is the meat PINK??? It's the result of cooking with wood in a closed pit. The smoke imports a delicious aroma & flavor as well as a distinctive pink color. Sp don't confuse this pinkness with undercooked or rare  all of our meats are slow-cooked for hours until perfectly done. The PINK you see is the sign of authentic BBQ!\\\" -Sweet Lucy's Smokehouse\"\n",
      "Actually  this is really a 4.5 star BBQ joint.  Have been here several times.  My last meal was a half rack of ribs and the BBQ chicken wings.  Every thing is smoked perfectly.  Not just slabbed with sweet sauce and served sugary.  Ribs were excellent  asked for the BBQ sauce on the side. Very tender  well smoked and delectable.  The wings were also perfect with the right amount of crunch on the outside and tender in the inside.  Have not ordered any of the sandwich's as I really didn't want to add any of the carbs/filler with all the great meats.  Decent bar inside and drinks are well poured.  Staff/service is also great and friendly.  Highly recommended if you like BBQ.\n",
      "I'm not on Lipitor  but after my trip to Sweet Lucy's  I should probably consider it.  One Monday  I wanted BBQ. No  scratch that - I needed BBQ. The hunger swept over me  I was insatiable. I made a desperate plea to my Facebook friends - \\where can I find the best BBQ in Philadelphia?\\\" I received some traditional answers  but a few NE friends suggested Sweet Lucy's. I head to Google. \\\"Oh  all you-can-eat buffet on Monday nights?\\\" To the NE I venture.  Sure  Sweet Lucy's looks like an abandoned warehouse from the outside  but inside you're transported into an utopia of BBQ. Let me give you the rundown of the all-you-can-eat options  starting with the assortment of sides: homemade cornbread  collard greens  corn on the cob  creamed spinach  mac and cheese  mashed garlic potatoes  roasted brussel sprouts  southwest salad  potato salad  cucumber salad  salad with fresh salmon). After you induce yourself into a near coma from the sides  you're presented with a selection of meats:  sausage  pulled pork  chicken  ribs...it goes on.   I'll be honest - I came with a goal to eat my literal weight in BBQ  and after four very robustly filled plates  a subsequent removal of belt  and loss of dignity  I stopped cashing out and left - mission complete.\"\n",
      "Sweet Lucy's has a nice homelike feel to it.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  I was stupid to have eaten late in the afternoon before going there  because once I walked in the door  the aroma of spicy greens and smoked meat gave me the yummies.  So I had to order something...the chili seemed an easy choice...spicy  full of meat.  I also had a side of corn bread which was light and moist...perfect.  My eyeballs were definitely taking in the ribs from friends plates.  They smelled great.  So from my limited vantage point as far as menu selection  I would make the trek back to sink my teeth into those ribs  and I think the place has a fine open atmosphere that was really comfortable.\n",

      "Our first day in Philadelphia we were walking around and got pretty hungry.  I was in the mood for a sandwich and we looked up the best deli spots in PA and this place came up.  It was a bit of a walk and we ended up at a super crowded public market.   The line was kind of long for this spot but went by quickly.  We decided on a Rachel style pastrami and corned beef and split those. Omg! The pastrami was awesome!!!!! I'm still thinking about it.  It was huge and loaded and juicy  well seasoned!\n",
      "I don't get into Philly as much as I used to  but whenever I am near the Reading Terminal Market I stop in.  Even though there are many food options  I find my way to Hershels for their corned beef brisket sandwich.  The meat is hand sliced and always melts in your mouth.  The number of Jewish deli's have been on the decline and it gets harder and harder to find a good sandwich.  Too many 'delis' buy corned beef top round or the flat part of corned beef brisket which are lean but without the flavor that the top deckel adds.  If your eyes are bigger than your stomach  go for the 1/2 sandwich.  The counter help is always friendly and efficient.  Like every food place at the Market  lunch times are jammed  so if you can get there after 2  waiting on line or for a table is easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a deli should be. Had the pastrami  Reuben with mustard instead of Russian and a new York dog with cheese  kraut  and mustard. Amazing. Would recommend it to anyone. A definate place to eat at in Philly\n",
      "\n",
      "So when in Philly have a cheese stake  we did  but not here. We got the corned beef and it was pretty bomb. The meat was juicy and mustard complimented. I think there was cheese on it  whether it was there or not it was a good sandwich. I split it with my boyfriend and half was enough for me  they give you so much meat I was full afterwards. It is a bit pricey $10 I think for the sandwich but I get it. It's a good quality sandwich  it's a definite must have try. Get one!\n",
      "Interesting enough if your going through Reading Terminal you may want to take a stop at Hershel's Eastside restaurant. They will dazzle you with an assortment of fresh cut meat affecting you with it's aroma  while you watch its succulent juices flow with each stroke of the knife. As I receive my meal with respect and politeness I was a little disappointed when me and my fiance took a bite of there meats. The meal was dry  it lack flavor  and oddly there didn't seem to be any sauce present to revive this meal. All in all  if your a sandwich lover this may be a place for you to go.\n",
      "I am so very torn with this review.  I had a hot pastrami sandwich there last week and I dare say it was better than Famous 4th.  It was tender  juicy and delicious.  A bit greasy but delicious.  So good that I was craving it and had to go back again. So  I went  today and got the very same thing.  The slices of pastrami were way too thick that I couldn't even bite through it.  Terribly disappointed this time.  I ended up chucking my sandwich after the first bite.  I'll go back again but not for pastrami.  I'll stick to Famous 4th for that one.\n",
      "Came here for dinner with girlfriends and was very happy with the health conscious menu. Naturally I chose the most unhealthy and went for the buffalo cauliflower appetizer. It's some of the best I've ever had. Great texture and not overly spicy. The shaved carrot is a perfect compliment.   Salads are huge. The Greek salad is awesome. Drinks were strong. Overall recommend.   They had live music (Friday night). And it seems like there's an outdoor space that's open in the warmer months.\n",
      "Cool place in a hip neighborhood.  Open at 7am  kitchen at 8am.  Relaxed place to read before the crowds get in.  Large outdoor terrace.  I have already had the Açaí Bowl and the Front Street Breakfast.  Both were excellent.  Recommended!\n",
      "I'm shocked at these stellar reviews.     Ventured out to fishtown specifically to try Front Street Cafe.  I had seen a write up about it and the healthy/vegan options sounded appealing.    We were sat and I looked at the table (very close to us) and saw the shrimp and grits and immediately got a little worried.  It looked absolutely horrible. Our server was very friendly  and we ordered a juice and a chai latte.  I have to say this was one of the absolute best chai's I've had.  If only the food measured up.    I asked the server what was the most popular dish.  She RAVED about the grain bowl which sounded healthy and delicious.  She actually said people \\lick the plate.\\\"  I am so confused at what they were eating.  It came out and the \\\"grains\\\" were simply dried rice with some beans thrown on a tostado (soggy) with some greens on top and a cream sauce.  The presentation was terrible (as per my photo) and the food was super bland and not at all fresh.    We also tried the soup of the day which was described as a \\\"spicy african stew.\\\"  It came out in this odd HUGE soup bow that was filled with the tiniest amount of soup.  It was barely luke warm  but I don't send things back so we kept it.  The waitress must have not had stew before  because this was simply vegetable soup.  We both tried it and said the same thing \\\"needs salt\\\" which is kind of 101 in the culinary world.  It was watery and was spicy like she described but completely lack luster.  Probably the first time I ever left soup in the bowl.     Lastly  we tried to vegan sides.  The scrapple and the bacon mushrooms.  The bacon mushrooms tasted like sugar mushroom and were completely soggy.  If you're looking for the BEST vegan bacon go a little farther to memphis taproom.  The \\\"bacon\\\" here is just sad.  The scrapple was not bad.  It was mushroom and some lentils but again could really use some seasoning.    This place would really benefit from having the chefs learn how to properly season and use some herbs.  I felt like I ate air.  I wouldn't ever eat here again but I'd definitely go to the cafe in front as I loved the chai and they have lots of cold pressed juices and kombucha.  In a city with SO many vegan options and plenty of places for good food  skip this one.\"\n",
      "We stumbled upon this place when the bar we originally wanted to go to had an hour wait for a table. They were able to immediately seat 8 of us in the back patio. The outdoor area is adorable and the umbrellas were clutch on the first 80 degree day of the year. Good drink options for reasonable prices. We also got the buffalo cauliflower (awesome!!)  chipotle turkey burger with shoestring fries  and the beef burger with a side salad. All of the food was delicious. Will definitely come back on the next warm day to enjoy their outdoor space.\n",
      "Amazing! The grilled cheese  buffalo cauliflower  burger  turkey burger  and soup all were absolutely delicious. Their apple spiced kombucha on tap was like Christmas in a cup  even the kids liked it. Service was wonderful and even on a Saturday with the place full of people we got our food quickly and with a smile. Coffee and hot chocolate was really good as well. We will be back here for sure!\n",
      "Brunch food was okay  nothing great.  My eggs benny was average at best.  The scrapple wasn't good and the hollandaise tasted like mustard.    I also prefer potatoes with it  not a side salad.  Price was slightly high for the amount of food.  The place is very nice inside and the coffee is good.  Service was on the slow side. It's a decent place for vegans but if you don't have food restrictions  there are much better places in Philly for brunch.\n",
      "We entered this restaurant for a first Friday viewing and chose to stay for dinner. We chose the outdoor seating as it was a pleasant summer evening and loved the ambience. Very romantic and great for a date night. There is seating inside as well as on the second level.   The drink menu has a Good selection of beers  wines and cocktails. The food menu is a vegan's delight and I would suggest all vegans to give this place a try. There are poultry and meat options as well. We tried the Queso and the fried chicken burger and both were delicious. I would like to try them for brunch sometime.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I want to love this place I've become frustrated lately with the fact that there always seems to be an extraordinarily long wait complete with at least 5 empty and open tables that are not being used. It's great that more and more people seem to be learning about front street but I'd really love it if management would simply hire enough staff to service the demand.   Regarding the food  it's typically great. I recommend the buffalo cauliflower as does everyone. Don't sleep on the turkey burger either. Solid place if you can get a table.\n",
      "\n",
      "So when we walked in the Pizza Shop we were greeted by a helpful waitress.  She answered any questions that we had concerning the ingredients used for the pizza.  So we tried the Hawaiian Pizza  Cheese Pizza  Buffalo Pizza and Best of all Cheesesteak Pizza... OMGEEEE they were all delicious.   This place you have to try\n",
      "\n",
      "My fiance' treated me here twice now. Im sorry I wasnt able to review sooner... but OMG. This place is amazing. If you're looking for a 'real' cheesesteak taste for vegetarian vegan... This is perfect! Yet  I actually sat down and had a slice recently. OH MY GLOB  the freakin' mushroom pizza was the BEST I ever had in my life!\n",
      "The best vegan pizza I have ever tried. The haymaker was absolutely amazing. I brought it back to work and all of my vegan coworkers went nuts. It had just the right amount of garlic. The crust was just the perfect thinness.   I also tried the Philly cheese steak while is on this crunchy chewy hoagie bun. It's a little bit greasy but I did not mind it.   Lastly  I tried the beet salad. It had caramelized onions and beets in assorted colors.  It was a really tasty and unique salad. I will be getting all of these items again plus the wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ambiance leaves much to be desired  but it is a pizzeria! Staff is a little aloof  but it's always busy. Food is just out of this world! I'm not vegan  but I swear their cuban is one of the best  meat or no meat  I've ever had! Definitely worth a stop!!\n",
      "The BEST Pizza!  Wow  I am so glad I made the trip.  The red sauce had such an amazing flavor.  We got the Fungi mushroom pizza (no cheese) and wished we would have gotten it with the red sauce that was on the Haymaker slice but the garlic sauce was delic too.  I wasn't sure about the wings but the habanero citrus sauce hit the spot.  It wasn't super hot and of course it is not a wing but it was perfect for \\chicken.  There were so many things on the menu I wish I would have had more time to go back.  \\\"Delivery\\\" is brought on a pedal bike so I can see why we were out of the delivery area.  The people were friendly and helpful.  The place is small and a nice hole in the all.  Is that an OXY?  It was warm without A/C but the night wasn't too bad.  The lemon vegan cupcake also hit the spot.  We lucked out and found a parking spot down street.  Best date night!  Would love to go back.\"\n",
      "So. I am neither a vegan. Nor am I a huge pizza fan.  BUT if pizza tasted like it does at Blackbird Pizzeria at every pizza joint  it might be the only food I ever consume. Seriously. What dark magic is going on in that deliciously crispy dough? What secret ingredient do they have to make the funghi pizza so craveworthy?  I was completely blown away. The funghi pizza and the chickpea parm had me smiling like it was Christmas. Both tasted better than their traditionally meat/egg/cheese filled counterparts.   I honestly cannot wait to go back and try more items on the menu. Absolutely fantastic.\n",
      "I went here today with my brother. We both got cheesesteaks and a pepperoni pie. The pizza was amazing. Perfect dough  great sauce  daiya cheese and the best pepperoni ever. It's awesome to be able to go to a pizzeria and get a huge selection of delicious vegan pies. I want to try all varieties. The cheesesteak was really good  my only complaint was the roll. I was expecting wanting a soft amoroso style long roll  but they use a ciabatta like situation  which I found to be too thick and hard and took focus from the filling. Which was perfect. I love the filling! It was super thin sliced seitan with perfectly grilled onion and mushroom. The flavor was really good. I cant wait to try the cakes  other pizzas sandwiches  and cole slaw. Im pretty pumped for the coleslaw. Im just so happy to have an all vegan pizza sandwich shop here  and I encourage everyone to support it! If youre vegan this is a must try  and if youre not you should check it out for a tasty and familiar introduction to vegan fare.\n",
      "This was hands down the most amazing vegan pizzas I've ever had the delight to taste. The \\cheese\\\" was deliciously melted and the mushroom toppings were so flavorful! It was a little on the oily side and I would have preferred less salt  but that's just me being picky.   The reason I gave Blackbird four stars instead of five is because I found the crust a bit disappointing. It was very hard and burned on the bottom--not doughy as I had expected. Granted  it might be because the pizza was delivered and wasn't exactly fresh out of the oven. Also  the cookies on their dessert platter were rock hard and too sweet.   Overall  great pizza place  just not so sure about the desserts.\"\n",

      "Wow... and here I am thinking I've already had the best brunch in the city (Sorry Green Eggs  Sabrina's  and all the other kick-ass brunch spots).  Hawthorne's you are now my new favorite spot for so many reasons.    I went on a busy Sunday afternoon  after stopping at Green Eggs but the wait was a little too long for my liking.  It took 10 minutes for me and a friend to be seated  and we were immediately greeted by a very friendly server who rattled off the specials and told us to help ourselves to their extensive \\self-serve\\\" beer selection.  And what a selection it is... and at such great prices  only $2.75 for Troegs DreamWeaver Wheat. (one of my absolute favorite beers).  After looking through the incredible variety of brunch options  I decided today would be the day I finally tried Fried Chicken and Waffles for the first time  and a special treat from Hawthorne's  they top each one with 2 poached eggs and Hollandaise sauce. (I also had the whole thing topped with Sliced Nova  it tastes great on Eggs Benedict).    HOLY SHIT!  This was the most flavorful breakfast I've ever had.  The sweet syrup meshed so well with the extremely buttery texture of the waffles (which were cooked perfectly  I loathe burnt waffles) and the saltiness of the fried chicken.   I ate about half the fried chicken with the waffles  and the other half with the perfectly poached eggs and sliced nova.  I think mixing all these flavors together would have taken away from the individual flavors of the dish  and I recommend asking for the poached eggs on the side in the future to make it easier to split it up.    I will be back for more Hawthorne's  I will be back often and eagerly awaiting your plates of greatness to satisfy my taste buds.  Can't wait to go to town on that beer cooler too!\"\n",
      "Hawthornes is a perfect Breakfast/ Brunch spot in the city. They have a WIDE variety of bottled individually sold beer. In fact wide would be putting it lightly. If I had to count I saw at least 10-12 coolers of beers with probably at least 40 different beers per cooler. So if you are looking for beer selctions this is the place for you.  As for breakfast it is a great spot for Breakfast  Lunch or Brunch. I recommend the frensh toast. The two peices they give you are huge. Filling for any one person  or the perfect side to order for a group of two. And at $9 its more then an affordable option for breakfast.  Our service was amazing. Our group of 4 went on New Years Day morning. Our server was more then accommodating when it came to our orders. She even went out of her way to put in an order that wasnt on the menu. She gets 5 out of 5 stars.\n",
      "I LOVE nachos so naturally I ordered the breakfast nachos for brunch and they were so terrible I barely ate them even though I was starving. The corn chips were completely soggy and everything was COATED in the same spice so there wasn't the crunch or the flavor mixing that nachos should have. The spice made the corn chips taste like doritos which was extremely off-putting. The staff was so busy  I couldn't get anyone's attention to ask for fresh chips to try to salvage the meal. I walked away 2.5 hours later  hungry  disappointed and then extremely annoyed that a 20% gratuity was added to our check. Ballsy move Hawthorne's... pretty sure 18% is the max allowed. Other meals looked good but the nachos thoroughly sucked  don't ever order them.\n",
      "Tried to make a reservation for 6 people for brunch on Saturday. The website let me make the reservation but they actually ended up calling me and telling me I couldn't make reservation for brunch. No big deal  we got there around 10 hoping to beat the typical 11am-ish crowd. We were very wrong. At 10am the wait was about 45min. For 6 people it's understandable but the place was packed nonetheless. It ended up being about an hour wait but the food was worth the wait.   We started with mimosa's - at $11 a pop I was hoping it was going to be the best mimosa I've ever had... it was pretty close. They give you a baby bottle of champagne & a glass of orange juice to make your own. I thought it was a pretty cool concept.   The food - I'm honestly not entirely sure what the rest of my party got because I was so focused on the Crabby Dick that I ordered. It's a bun with a crab cake inside & two poached eggs on top. It was served with homefries. Simply amazing. Some other table winners were the classic french toast & blueberry waffle with pulled pork on top.   The wait is always annoying but the food is that good that it's worth standing outside for an hour to get your hands & mouth on a crabby dick. Yep.\n",
      "I'd call it poor service  but they didn't give me any. If I had to guess my baseball cap and oversized sweatshirt where a little too urban.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stopped by as I saw per phillytapfinder that Hawthornes had Bell's Hopslam on tap.  It was pretty sparse on a mid-Saturday afternoon and we were quickly seated at the table of our choice.    This was the first time I'd visited and wasn't entirely sure of the process once I entered.  There are about 5 beers on tap that you can order from the waitress or you can browse the 10 coolers of beer by the bottle and have it added to your tab at the counter (based on your table number).  It's a bit different and took me a few seconds to get it sorted but once I did it made total sense.  The interior was very inviting  rustic  bright  and laidback.  We didn't have any food but both the lunch & dinner menu looked amazing and I look forward to returning again to sample.    The beer selection is quality and while some don't like the mason jars which are used for the beer I'm sure you can ask for another glass as they exist for the beers on tap.  There is also the beer takeout option with discounts on six and eight pack purchases  growlers are also available.    This four star review could certainly turn into a five star once I sample the food  so don't take this four to mean its anything less than superb.  Enjoy!!\n",
      "Great homey environment and definitely in my top 10 lunch places. Can take a while to get a table  but is well worth the wait.  Vast beer selection  engaged staff  and wonderful comfort food. Great place to go with a group.\n",
      "Morgan's Pier is perfect for those balmy summer nights when all you want is a pretty view  nice weather  and some yummy drinks with your friends.  I didn't get to try any of their food  but I would highly recommend the Watermelon Ricky and the White Sangria if you prefer something sweet and fruity.  I loved the super low-key and laid-back vibe here. Definitely one of my new favorite spots in Philly.\n",
      "What a great concept/idea for a fresh  summertime  waterfront hangout. A great job was done on the decor and layout. Lots of buzz in every direction about this place and for good reason - I can see this becoming a regular warm weather hangout over the next few months for myself and many friends. As a seasoned patron of many of our great city's drinking and dining establishments  a rule to live by is to avoid avoid avoid anywhere until they've been open for at least a few weeks to give them time to iron out the kinks. Even the best establishments need training wheels at first  and that's OK. We expect it.   We made the mistake of thinking it might be low-key and not-so-crowded on Memorial Day Monday after a full-on 'grand opening' weekend. I wouldn't say it was packed  but it was very crowded when we arrived. We had hoped to saddle up to the bar and enjoy a drink and maybe some food  but sadly my fiance and I were only able to find one stool and sorta share it while we had a few drinks and scoped out a table. The beer list is extensive and varied  and I love that they have a decent amount of canned (cheaper) beers. The 3-4 members of the bar staff we dealt with were slammed  yet were all pleasant  seemed experienced and were on point. No complaints there. I just wished we'd stayed at the bar.   After a while our bellies were rumbling and we had given up on hopes of eating at the bar and pounced on a high top table near the stage/DJ (who needs a lesson on volume control/EQ'ing  but that's another story!). As mentioned  we know and expect any establishment will have hiccups on opening weekend. Table service  however  was sorely lacking. The table we grabbed hadn't been cleared and we waited for a good 15 minutes before a busboy or server even glanced in our direction (there was no hostess - the bartender directed us to sit at any table that was open).   Eventually a busboy swooped by and grabbed the empty cans and trash left from the previous customers. Not once did anyone wipe down our table or provide clean napkins/silverware. Eventually a waitress stopped and asked if we \\were OK\\\" (as if she/someone already greeted us and taken an order). We explained we wanted to order food and drinks - my fiance and I each ordered canned beer assuming it wouldn't be a long wait. It was then we were informed half of the beers on our menus were no longer available because  in the servers words \\\"the management did not plan this out very well\\\". For food  I ordered the popcorn shrimp  and a burger and fries and my fiance asked for the chopped salad w/ buttermilk dressing. We were never offered water. No biggie  but the high in Philadelphia yesterday was 90 degrees. Also  table still never wiped down  no silverware/napkins.  After a healthy 20-25 minute wait  our food arrived. But not our canned beers. My burger was tiny but tasty and the fries reminded me of Mickey Dee's  which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The popcorn shrimp was also average - not bad  not great. The salad my fiance received was not only NOT chopped (ripped  maybe?) but was completely missing dressing. Also  still no silverware. Was she expected to eat this thing with her hands? At this point our server was nowhere to be found. Neither were our canned beers we had now ordered a half hour ago. Hmmmmmmm.   Finally our flustered server resurfaced with the silverware  when we inquired about our canned beers she took on the look of a deer in headlights  and rushed away after promising that the beers were on the house. Another 10 minutes pass (you can't make this stuff up)  the beers arrive with a second promise from our waitress that they are on the house. We thank her  she walks away  and... what a surprise! One of the beers is wrong! *Facepalm*   At this point  we're simply trying to quickly finish up our food (the salad was average according to my other half) and either get out while we're still relatively calm  or settle our tab and head back to the now less crowded bar. We ask for our check  and comically  she has it to us instantly. And what happens to be on the check!?!? The beers that she promised were on the house (on multiple occasions!!!I) Ugh. I couldn't help but laugh.   At this point it was either leave a shitty tip  make a scene with the waitress  or ask for the manager. The easiest and most gratifying thing to do was to take a deep breath  and... leave a shitty tip. So that's what we did. And  as someone who has worked in the service industry and has many friends and family who have and still do - I feel appropriately guilty about leaving such a shitty tip - but that's the trade off for such shitty  shitty  service.   In closing  this place has TONS of potential and will probably do very well. As I've mentioned above we expected to have less than perfect service  and they'll no doubt iron out these kinks in time. We can only hope they quickly filter out the inexperienced/clueless employees & focus on a better overall customer experience.\"\n",
      "I'm really torn over this review. I want to say lots of positive things  but most of that goes towards the ambiance. You really can't beat this view. Everyone is so hyped up that George Sabatino is here  and I don't mean to be hard on the guy  but it's not just food that I'm droooling over.   I ordered the cheeseburger and my friend ordered the bacon sandwich. The cheeseburger was fine  but if I'm going to pay that much  I'd rather go to Shake Shack. And it's still a pet peeve of mine when they don't come with fries and you have to pay extra. Though I am a fan of pickled veggies  which all the sandwiches here come with. My friend's bacon sandwich was very dry. The bread definitely needed more than some residual fat and swipe of mustard. It needs a sauce. I tried to use the aioli from the fries but it still didn't quite do the trick. The Really Good Fries are not as good as advertised. They're overly salty and the aioli is not spicy.   To drink  I got a Dark and Stormy which was fine (but it's not a complicated drink). My friend stuck to beer. On warmer days  I want to try a Watermelon Ricky to see if it's all the rave. I do quite enjoy the 21st Amendment beer on its own.   I'm not opposed to trying other things on the menu. I know I'll be back because I love the patio so much. I think I'll splurge on the Dining Menu because someone ordered the whole fish and it looked delicious as it passed us.\n",
      "Great place. Bribe guy 75 dollars to get in. Would get 4.688 stars if install air conditioners.  Obama out.\n",
      "\n",
      "A great concept in theory  but the execution was thus: Ran out of food Memorial Day weekend and reduced the hours they were open without adjusting the sign on their door.  If you go to a destination bar and they are not open as advertised  what then shall you do?\n",
      "Night time review.  Not surprised the only thing this place has going for it is location (and you're facing the wall of a bridge so its not even nice.)  The drinks are overpriced and watered down. Expected. Overcrowded past capacity? I can deal with that.  But when the door staff are complete and utter assholes? There is no way I or any of my friends will ever spend another dime here. I'm 24. Never had any hassle with ID at any bar or club on the East or West coast. This is the first time I've ever had an issue  and door staff were far from professional. I offered an alternative form of ID. Bouncer shoves me away and says he will call the cops for trespassing.   When high school level drop outs are getting a high of what little power they can get at the front door  you know there's a problem with the venue. Add in $10 cover and the crappy music played on repeat all night and you have a recipe for success.\n",
      "Went here for Friday night and it was pretty packed. They have a lot of bars though so I never had to wait excessively long for a drink. Bathroom was a different story  that line was seriously ridiculous. I like the cool foggy dance floor so I hung around the bar there for a while. At some point this chica challenged me to a dance off  she came at me hard but I held it down. These things happen so stay ready  my friend.  Overall  it's a hip weekend spot if there's nice weather. If you drink like I do  prepare to spend a good amount of money but being cool ain't easy  ya know? I'll probably go back a couple times before the Summer's over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh Morgan's Pier  what has happened to you? I booked a work party here for a Tuesday night. The booking agent was kind of a bitch and took several days to get back to me. The rest of the staff was friendly and nice  but maybe overworked or on drugs (or both?)  The one bartender kept spilling drinks left and right.  Ok so the food  gone are the amazing fish tacos of last year  now its really overpriced bbq joint with small portions. We ordered one of each appetizer and most of them came out cold  especially the fries and fried cauliflower. When did charging 9 dollars for 6 wings become the norm?  The drinks were ok  overpriced and a little watered down.  The bathrooms were super gross. The view was great  but I doubt we'll be back.\n",
      "'Grossly underwhelming and peculiar' is the most concise way to describe the dining experience.  Four of us had the four course tasting menu.  Peculiarly  we were able to select an item from each - app  pasta  entree and dessert - so we were left wondering what its importance is.  Nevertheless  the highlight was my friend's short rib ragu - they were melt in your mouth tender over surprisingly light  fluffy pillows of gnocchi.  Everything else went downhill.  The pasta special black pepper linguini with scallops were good  the spring risotto was standard  the antipasti was stale  as if it sat awhile  the desserts were standard  nothing to sing about.  The lowest point was my strip steak  well done instead of medium rare as ordered  but the brussel sprouts were absolutely fubar'd - overcooked and so overvinegared that none of us could even identify them.  The service could have used some work.  When asking our server about the tasting  the opening statement was the rule stated in the menu - that everyone at the table must participate.  After dropping our entrees and offering cracked pepper  the runner scurried away as I was saying yes.  Our server must have sensed our discontent  having dropped off our check before we could finish our desserts and coffee.  At over $50 a head not including tip and its air of exclusivity (cash only  no reservations)  I hoped for either better service or stellar food.  Unfortunately  as both left me extremely unsatisfied  there will be no repeat for me.\n",
      "This is my favorite restaurant in Philly  hands down.  I've been just about everywhere  and while there are other places that might be better for special occasions  in terms of food quality  price  and atmosphere  Mercato can't be beat for a regular dining spot.  The restaurant itself is cozy and romantic.  The floors are hardwood  with exposed brick on the walls.  The kitchen is open and right in the back of the dining area.  The space is really tiny  and the tables are very close together  which may seem uncomfortable at first  but it really creates a lovely atmosphere.  In the warmer months  there are outdoor tables that you can sit at as well.  It's a BYOB  so you save some money by bringing your own bottle (or two!).   The service here is flawless  and the host or hostess will send a text when your table is ready  so you can grab a drink at one of the other bars nearby  or take a stroll through the beautiful  quiet surrounding neighborhoods.  A few things you should know beforehand: (1) Mercato doesn't take reservations  so there is often a wait.  Sometimes it can be pretty long if you are trying to get a table at prime dinner time.  (2) The place is tiny.  There is barely any room.  When it is full  it gets really loud.  There will also not be much space between you and other parties.  If you have a big party  it can take a really long time to get a table because you will need to wait for several parties to get up before they can join the tables. (3) It's cash only  and not exactly cheap  so fill up your wallet beforehand.  If you do forget to bring cash  there is a convenience store a short walk away that has an ATM you can use.    The food is where Mercato excels.  I highly recommend the meatballs for an appetizer.  There are really flavorful  and the sauce is one of the best I've had on anything.  The meat and cheese trays are also really delicious  and everything is high-quality.  I brought my father here once  and both of us tried salads and were delicious.    For an entree  I always get the bolognese.  Every time I come here  I say I'm going to get something different  but then I see it and I end up ordering the same thing.  I can't say enough good things about the bolognese.  The dish combines pasta with chunks of veal and pork in a cheesy  cream sauce.  The meat is extremely (and I mean EXTREMELY) flavorful  and the noodles are perfect to hold the sauce.   At first the portion looks a bit small  but it's really more than enough.  They have a side that combines broccoli rabe with sausage and meatballs and is also one of my favorites.   Finally  the service is where Mercato really shines and has won me over for life.  Earlier this winter  we decided to go on a cold evening.  We got there and were told it would be a twenty minute wait.  We waited outside under the heat lamps for almost an hour.  At first  we were frustrated about being told such an incorrect estimate  but when we were finally seated  they apologized profusely  and brought out a free meat and cheese tray with other goodies.  When our meatballs were brought out a bit too rare  they cooked the originals more and brought us out an additional order as well.  Overall  I recommend Mercato to absolutely anyone.\n",
      "Completely fabulous. I went with four other people  while visiting friends in Philly  and the outdoor seating was charming  the service was pretty good (our waiter spilled a bunch of the prosecco we brought so that was kind of \\meh\\\"  but other than that  he was great) and the food was AMAZING.   We did not get the tasting menu  but we did make sure to get a different dish for each person  in order to sample. My favorite was (conveniently) my own dish. I had the special  which was a proscsiutto wrapped some sort of meaty white fish...I want to say sole...(this was a week ago...) with crab meat flaking around it and covered in beurre blanc sauce. I think my mouth just started to water while typing this...  There were also scallops  pyramid pasta  squid ink pasta  and the ragu. All perfectly excellent. The dessert left a wee bit to be desired. (Gelatto in an espresso cup is not  like  the most exciting thing in the world.) But I'm still giving five stars for such a nice evening.  The outdoor summer ambiance was totally charming. We arrived at 8pm  just enough time to enjoy the setting sun and then have dessert by candlelight.  If you're in Philly and you want to enjoy a special occasion without going the far end of the high dining spectrum  I definitely recommend this place.\"\n",
      "i likes!  loved that the whole menu was restaurant week approved. this place was all about the food  no frills. nowadays  i lean towards the small  homey restos. this place definitely suits that. great byob spot.  started with bruschetta and grilled octo for appis. the octo could not have been more perfect (not chewy at all!) and mushroom bruschetta yummo.  entree was scallops and sea bass. scallops was plumpy and went well with mushroom risotto. loved the cripy skinned sea bass. tiramisu and cheesecake were moist and not too sweet.  trust me you would want to skip r2l or xix this time....choose this place instead and you won't regret your choice!\n",
      "Not too thrilled with our Mercato experience   the space is cramped and HOT  we had to fan ourselves with the menus and actually had to ask for ice for the water! It is also loud due to the acoustics  spent most of the night asking people to \\say that again\\\". The food was ok but a bit bland in my opinion and pricey  but it's CASH ONLY and gratuity included with our group of five. The only thing that was great about it was that it's BYOB.\"\n",
      "Love this place! This is one of our top 3 restaurants. The food is amazing and we have never been disappointed. The restauarant itself is very cozy  but that is part of the experience. We have been here multiple times and will continue to go!\n",
      "This was my third and  most importantly  LAST time coming to Mercato. I brought my parents here for their anniversary dinner because I had raved about the 4 course dinner with large portions (my parents love taking food home) and a reasonable price.   Turns out the price jumped from $48 to $56 and the first course was changed from choosing your own appetizer to a plate of charcuterie for the table to share.   The appetizer was my favorite course and it's removal would have already made me think twice about coming again. However  the fact that they raised the price and ALSO removed one of the courses  to be replaced with a $10 spread of charcuterie  was insulting.   Mercato  while small  is packed every time I have been there so I guess I get it. But they are too greedy for me and I definitely will no longer be dining there.\n",
      "My wife and l had dinner there yesterday. It was our second time there. And just like the first time  the food was incredible. We started with the meatballs stuffed with cheese. Then we split the rosemary pasta with a wild boar ragu. And finished with the scallops. Yum  yum  yum!! The staff was friendly and helpful. We are already looking forward to going back.\n",
      "We went there last night for rest week. This was our first time there. The place is very small n it seats 56 ppl!! I'm glad that wasn't the case last night cuz we would have to leave right away. This place is a gem to find BUT wayyy too cramped. We were greeted by a very friendly staff. We told her it's our first time here. Her recommendations on our entire meal was ON POINT!!! Everything was delicious!!! The ambiance was quiet n romantic. I love how they have an open kitchen. I've posted some pics of our wonderful n very tasty dinner. Btw  it byob n cash only. That's a plus. We like to dine at byob cuz you know how much you can crank up that bill with a couple of drinks. I love love this place  but do hope they might cut back on the seatings a bit. Whatever your conversations will be  the next couple will def hear EVERYTHING!! Even IF you whisper. Oh n the couple will be able to see your texts too. I'm still giving it a five star cuz I can't give six for the food. It's THAT good\n",
      "I loved Mercato!! I ordered the pyramid pasta  and it was delicious. I also tried both of my friends meals  and they were right up there in amazingness with my meal. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. We also had the bruschetta trio as an appetizer. You guessed it--great again!!  The cherry on top is that Mercato is a BYOB restaurant. I will be back!\n",
      "I'm Vietnamese and I love a generous bowl of Pho. Although the quality is not top-notch  it's really good for the price. Generous portions and fast service. If you want homey  no frills  delicious food I'd go here. A normal bowl of pho is about $6.50 before tip  but that should fill you up! The large bowl is really quite large so come in hungry :)  I also had their vermicelli  pork  spring rolls  Viet sausage. The meat quality is average  but again  can't beat the price and the generous portions.\n",
      "My favorite pho place! I've been coming here for Pho and Vietnamese dishes for 10+ years - consistent throughout! Cheap beers/drinks  and casual. Also much closer than 11th and Washington and the prices are also very cheap.   The service isn't stellar  but that's not it's known for.  Would highly recommend the clams in black bean sauce  fried spring rolls  and of course - the Pho. Must try for first-timers!\n",
      "Having had some very bad experiences with Philly food--quality  cleanliness  and so forth--I decided to not take a chance and go to Yelp for advice on best Vietnamese/Pho places. I had a cold that needed to disappear  thus I went straight for a hot bowl of beef Pho and a (very large) side of Chinese broccoli with garlic.   I would return here again and again  given the fact that this is probably the best East Coast Pho I have ever had. San Francisco and Seattle still have a handful of places that have this place beat. Regardless  it was excellent.   The service is friendly  quick  and all for a very decent price. I finished my meal with a mango smoothie  which was refreshing and tasty.   Highly recommended from one visitor to another!\n",
      "Arguably the best Pho restaurant in Philadelphia's Chinatown  the Pho in Chinatown isn't great to begin with. Washington Ave is a drive away if you're looking for something slightly better. The place itself was like any standard Pho restaurant  cheap tables  small cramped spaces  etc. I ordered a large bowl which was two dollars extra from the regular bowl at ~$6. Food came out quickly and the servers provided refills of tea and water quickly. Overall  service was pretty good. They also listened to our request of steaming up the bean sprouts. For the Pho itself  it was average across the board. I needed to put a good amount of \\extra\\\" ingredients to get it where I wanted. For the price and the service I couldn't complain though. I'd gladly go back again  but it may not hit the spot for some of you Pho aficionados.\"\n",
      "I've been to Choo Choo a couple times since my initial review.  Okay  look  the food is slightly above average  but you can go with a vegan  a gluten-intolerant person  a gluten-intolerant vegan and voracious carnivores and find something satisfying.  The portions are huge  too.  Service is what you'd expect  and it can be a little crowded  but it's a solid solution to an intersection of food allergies and ethical choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend and I came here during a day trip. She used to live in Philly and this was one of her usual hangouts  so she was very excited to bring me!  I had the rice dish with shredded pork and grilled pork  and egg. I also had a lychee drink. Everything was super tasty! My favorite part  other than the grilled pork itself  was the bill  which on my end came to around $10 after tipping and even with the drink. Wonderful!\n",
      "This pho place is really great. As with all pho places the service is amazingly fast. The broth is really tasty. Not sure if there is MSG in it but I like it :D  I've come here twice and must say that if you want cheap eats in a casual place this hits the spot.   Note: it is run by canto people but they do Pho right :D\n",
      "Went on a Sunday and it was pretty busy. I ordered pho Tai and broth was good  but the rare steak is a bit thicker than usual. They had about 6 waiters and this place is pretty small. Seats about 40 and on this busy day  they always seem to hanging out at the back and never checked on me after they delivered the food. That's pretty typical of a vietnamese restaurant.\n",
      "Delicious and cheap  my friends and I all know this place as \\The choo choo train restaurant.\\\"  I was first introduced to this place by my chinese (now ex) girlfriend and her family a few years ago  and it has since become my favorite destination for inexpensive asian cuisine.  The restaurant isn't especially well lit  or even impeccably clean for that matter - but I love it regardless of it's lack of ambience.  The food is that good!  BTW - Is there a proper way to eat shrimp paste wrapped around sugar cane?  I've just been eating it like a drumstick.... but I always hide a little when I do  and feel like a tourist in my own city.\"\n",
      "Went for lunch with coworkers mid week. Not too crowded and plenty of staff. Eager to fill your water glass  a little too eager that they are regularly reaching across the tables.   Never mind that  the food was very good. We split two orders of the vegetarian rolls (3 per order). Two of us ordered the Pad Thai  the other two ordered clay pot soups. One soup was Green Curry Seafood Soup in clay pot (very spicy) and served with rice. She loved it.   I am blanking on the other soup.  It was in a clay pot and was more tomato based and not served with nice  nor was it as spicy. She also enjoyed her lunch immensely.  The Pad Thai was listed as spicy so we both requested the dish with less spice. The restaurant happily obliged. The dish did skimp on the shrimp (only 4  and tiny)  but was generous with the tofu and sprouts. It had good flavor  but I picked up a strong syrupy sweetness at the end. Next time  I would request the sweet to be scaled down too.   Lunch for the four of us ran $54 before tip. Not too bad but slightly more expensive than other Chinatown spots.  Will return. Place has a large menu to select from and is deceivingly cavernous.\n",
      "LOVE! Great BYOB- and tolerant if the crowd gets a little...rowdy. Largeeee food menu which is intimidating as there are very \\safe\\\" items and other much more authentic dishes.  The staff is very willing to help with recommendations.  Prices are very  very reasonable. Large area and great for large groups!! Have been a couple times and will certainly be back.\"\n",
      "The roti canai and the Indian Mee Goreng will hit the spot! Although I only got takeout from here  the food was beyond amazing and they got the spice level just right and even made the dishes vegetarian for me. The inside isn't anything exceptional but you come here for the food. If you're looking for a mandalas in place that can do no wrong- it's banana leaf.\n",
      "This was my first time and definitely my last. Ordered this Mango Chicken and it only had 4-5 pieces of small chicken. It's an $18 dish after taxes and I cannot believe how cheap they are with the chicken. If it was served as an appetizer for 1/3 of the price then I wouldn't really complain but this dish was marketed as a full meal.  I left feeling ripped off.  All they did is mix the mango in sriracha and some sugar. I spent most of my time digging around the mango in search of chicken. Never again. I'd be extremely wary of the other comments on this restaurant who praise the sub-par food here. Because the main people who frequent Banana Leaf appear to be the hipster-type who would probably consider sushi from a gas station as \\authentic.\\\"   I lost faith in center city establishments. Where the growing trend is to charge more for poor quality. I find much better food in ghetto areas like Washington avenue in South Philly where you always get your monies worth. No wonder most of Anthony Bourdaines reviews come from the outskirts of Philly and never center city.  I know that after reading this you may be pondering  \\\"Why is this guy giving a bad review after only having one bad experience?\\\" Well  having lived in the Philippines half of my life and been to Vietnam  China  Japan  Westminster California  and many asian establishments in Fort Lee  NJ and Manhattan  trust me when I say that most of the food on the menu does not look appetizing at all. I live  breathe  and sleep asian cuisine. Knowing how the food is going to taste by just looking at the ingredients on the menu  and the mango chicken appeared to be something that would remind me of being back on the west coast. Everything else looks like cheap Thai or Chinese takeout that has been altered a certain way to look halfway decent ( i.e inside mango or pineapple shell )  Anyway this place appears to be good for the college freshman with poor taste in food who just wants a spot to bring alcohol into. If that's you then you'll love getting ripped off here and be blindly thankful for it.  If you have a sophisticated asian palate and are looking for quality then steer far away from here. Because you could find much better food for the same price you'd spend here somewhere else.\"\n",
      "One of my favorite restaurant in china town.  I really love their Char Kuey Teow. It's better than Penang restaurant by far.  Their Kangkung stir fry  vegetable and Indian Mie Goreng also really nice.  They usually give you free desert or free oranges at the end of the meal.  It's BYOB  so I always bring wine to share with friends.\n",
      "If you and your friends were going to go to Penang for dinner tonight   do yourself a favor and go to banana leaf instead.  Your friends will be impressed by the food and by the bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really like this restaurant! The service so great! Everyone who is working  serves you! It's a pretty cool thing!   It's a BYOB! Don't forget your bottle!   Great restaurant for groups!  I really enjoyed the food! Be adventurous and try something new! Ask the servers...they have great suggestions!   Sushi is also good!\n",
      "NYC lacks a great Malaysian restaurant so that's why I travel to Philly to enjoy my Malaysian desires.   Much better than all the Malaysian restaurants in nyc - Banana leaf has such flavorful delicious authentic Malaysian dishes.   Just wished they avoid serving sushi  I can tell it is horrid. Also  dual national food restaurants usually don't do well. (I mean come on  would you eat at a Chinese Japanese restaurant.....) AVOID SUSHI  Okay  I admit i forgot what I ate  but their noodles were delicious AND you have to TRY their pancake - made perfectly! The manager/boss there is very pleasant and the ambiance though dark and wooden serves well.   So avoid nearby PENANG and come to banana leaf instead  you won't regret it(unless you order sushi)\n",
      "The chicken was tough and difficult to eat. It was technically white meat but had the texture of something you'd get at a low budget Chinese take out  very rubbery  some parts over cooked as if boiled too long. My friend who accompanied me agreed. I didn't even want to take my leftovers home. I prefer Penang and probably won't come back here.\n",
      "This place is awesome. They have great halal food that is as good as it gets. I came here on a Saturday night and it was super busy. Took about 20-25 minutes just to get our food (1 cheesesteak with everything and 1 chicken maroush) and all the while we had to wait for people to finish and leave just so we had a place to sit and eat.   The restaurant is small and crowded but its also probably because it was a Saturday night on a 3 day weekend. The service was great and Saad and his crew are super friendly  helpful  and humble. He didnt even want me to pay until I was done eating!   The only thing that is kind of annoying is his payment policy. Cash and debit card only! No credit cards allowed. He does have an ATM inside if you need but also if you plan to use your debit card  only purcahses $30 and over are allowed. Other than that this place has great food  portions  and people. Definitely returning next time im in Philly.\n",
      "The Chicken Maroosh is enough for me to drive from northern New Jersey to Philadelphia and enjoy. I'm serious. I love this place and I love Saad. Can't wait to go back back. The Chicken Maroosh guys  order it. You will NOT regret it.\n",
      "I have had only one experience with this restaurant but it is definitely a unique one - and NOT in a good way.   I was in Philly visiting family and we decided to give the place a try. The food itself was mediocre at best but that alone would not earn a place the dubious honor of a single star. Rather  it was a situation that occurred with our order. The restaurant got our order wrong so we called back. Instead of trying to remedy the situation  the person on the other end - presumably Saad himself - lashed out angrily with insults and hung up. How this place continues to thrive with customer service and management like that is beyond me.\n",
      "Best chicken sandwich in Philly!!  The chicken maroosh is one of a kind. Amazing chicken  tomatoes  pickles  and the tasty garlic sauce. I recommend getting extra for your fries.\n",
      "Best cheesesteaks in the city  hands down.  Something about that halal meat  I guess... none of those hormones  steroids  epinephrine  or cortisol!  The lamb shwarma is great too.  Can't go wrong with Sa'ads.  The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious.  My only grip is that it has really outgrown its space.  I rarely eat there  so doesn't bother me.  I wholeheartedly recommend this place.\n",
      "Definitely my go to sandwiches. The chicken tawook maroosh is a favorite of mine  and last night  with just 10 minutes left til closing I got the craving. I called in quickly and they said that if i could make it by 9pm closing  my food would be ready. I sprinted over in shorts and I wasn't disappointed- the sauce is perfect  the veggies were crunchy and I managed to eat the whole thing  though I wish I had half left for today.   From their sides to their sandwiches to their platters  they put a lot of love into the work they do and they do it quickly.\n",
      "Great food  great service  try the chicken Maroosh sandwich.   Tips: Call ahead and get your food to go  because there is limited seating available.  It is very cold in the winter time.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a vegetarian  the Falafel was one of the worst things I have ever had. It was dry  the pita was dry  they had no authentic hot sauce and the white sauce was completely overrated. The hummus was absolutely tasteless. They need to do better not sure how  but definitely need to improve.\n",
      "Prices are good and portions are epic! The chicken maroosh really is what hit the spot for me. Chicken was tender and very flavorful. As an Arab  I thought this place was the best mix of Authentic and Americanized Arabic food. You literally get the best of both worlds. Nothing on this menu is bad. Saad (owner) is very friendly and actually wants you to really enjoy your food. Yes the seating wasn't the best but screw that the food deserves 150%!   PS: Food is very addictive! I'm full and I still want to go back and eat the rest of the food!\n",
      "So I had the brilliant idea of making a reservation for a good friend and myself on a Sunday evening at 6:45. When we arrived we were told that we would be seated about 20 minutes after our reservation time. The place was jammed packed  but i did not expect to wait an hour and fifteen minutes before we were seated!   When we sat down  the waiter  a very young man  was pretty short with us. He served us cold sides  and then disappeared. Each and every waiter in the place was on their cell phones. I even noticed that his cell phone was in his hand as he refilled my water. A refill I had to ask no less than five times for! Here is the kicker. I went to the bathroom and there was not a single sheet of toilet paper nor was there soap!!! SO GROSS!!!!!    It's a shame  though as the food was actually pretty good. They just need better management. I.e. Someone who is there and actually watching to see that his or her staff isn't doing their job.   So not worth the money  trust me.\n",
      "This review solely based on their foods  drinks and services that they gave during my friend's wedding party.  First was the drinks/bar. It was good. Love it. Even though the situation was getting quite hectic  but I applaud those bartenders. They didn't get upset or anything. They served everyone quickly and without complaining.  Then comes their salad bar. They have good varieties. (I didn't go to Fogo yet. So I don't know if Fogo's salad bigger or higher quality or whatever. What I ate over there at Chima was good)  Next was the main menu. The meats. Don't judge me. That was the first time I ate at a brazilian steakhouse. The way things work was new  and I found it pretty neat. Their meat is delicious. I love it.  Excellent service too!  Overall  it is a new and satisfying experience for me. I'll be back for sure.\n",
      "technical review is 3.5 stars...    went here for restaurant week... for $35 all you can eat is a great deal.  They give you a little card that you can flip for \\go\\\" or \\\"stop\\\" as the guys in pirate pants bring around meat on sticks.  i kept mine at go because i wanted to try everything!  there were definitely favorites and not-so favorites...   LOVE:  the hugely stocked salad/soup bar.  great for getting started and all items were a nice compliment to the meal.  LOVE: the appetizers that come to the table in tiny dishes.  i think potato puree  some kind of spherical meat thing(?) and something else.  all were AWESOME. i could have drunk the potato puree from a pitcher it was so tasty.   DON'T love: my BF wanted to save room for the meats  and didnt eat much of the side dishes or salads... needless to say he was very sick the next morning and had to call off work. not sure if it was the lamb (we all thought it was a little funky) or if it was just too much meat for one person.  LOVE:  the parmesan pork. my fave.   DON'T love:  the bacon wrapped filet was under impressive.   this place doesnt include dessert in their rest wk. menu... we did get coffee and desserts but they were a little high for what it was. i wish they had a coffee bar similar to the salad bar that was included in the price.  now  Chima is always all you can eat  i believe the normal price is $50/person. i would not pay that much for this place.  if you want to go  try it for restaurant week.\"\n",
      "I ate at Chima for the first time a month ago  and I think I'm still full. It was my first experience at a Brazilian steakhouse and my husband and I really enjoyed it. What's not to like about men coming around to serve you unlimited cuts of delicious meats?   The atmosphere was bustling  but not distracting. Our server was running around like a crazy man and left us for a bit too long at the end of the meal  but he was very friendly. I don't even remember what types of meats I ate  but my only complaint was that the filet was very salty. I really enjoyed the sides  especially the fried bananas  which were amazing.  Now here comes my #1 issue of the night: the wine list. Very expensive. I was perusing the list at the bar while we were waiting to be seated  and seeing nothing less than $12 or $14 a glass. So I asked the bartender if they had a house pinot noir  which they did. Silly me for not asking what the price was -- it was $14! I've never ever been anywhere where the house wines were as much or more than other options on the menu. It's not even about the extra couple of dollars  it's just the principle.  Anyway  overall it was a thumbs up. I wouldn't rush back there as it's too indulgent to do very often  but I'm sure I'll go back eventually.\n",

      "One of the best all you can eat meat restaurants in the city  just make sure you are willing to spend over a hundred bucks for a table for 2\n",
      "Good Food  but Not Worth the Money  Chima is a Brazilian steakhouse  which means everyone pays the same price for dinner and you can eat as much as you want. You are seated at a table  and a waiter comes over to see if you want any drinks to start (the drink menu is on an iPad). Then he/she directs you to the salad bar to start. Then you flip over a car on your table indicating that you want meat and waiters come by your table every few minutes with long skewers of meat to ask you if you would like some and if you would like a piece that is more on the rare side or more on the well side. Below is some more detail on the salad bar  meat selection  atmosphere  and price.   SALAD BAR:  The salad bar was surprisingly expansive. They have everything from arugula salad  to salami and cheeses. They also had some fresh asparagus and beets  rice  and an assortment of cheeses. Everything was good but I would suggest not filling up on this stuff because the meat is where you get your real value.   MEAT:  The meat here is really the best part of the meal. The waiters walk around with different cuts of different meats and you can tell them if you would like some or not. There is a picture and description of each meat at your table so that you know what you're ordering. I thought the leg of lamb and the top sirloin were the two best. Everything is really nicely cooked and you leave the place pretty filled up.   ATMOSPHERE:  The scene here was probably not what you would expect from a Brazilian steakhouse. It is located in a very business-centric area and there was a pretty big crowd at the bar for happy hour (You can hear the music from the dining room). Everything about this place is modern and the tables are spread out so that you don't really hear your neighbors. But for me  it lacked any sort of charm. Not really a foodies' ideal place (even though I wouldn't say I'm a foodie myself.   PRICE:  This is the biggest problem with Chima and I why I couldn't give it anything more than 3 stars. Dinner costs $54 each! I don't care how much you think you can eat  you'll never make up that cost.  I came here with a gift certificate for one dinner and paid for my partners' food. If I didnt have the gift card  it would have never been worth it. If you dont have any gift certificates you are looking at a bill of over $70 each after tax and tip (not including drinks). With Philly being generally such a well priced city  the prices here don't feel worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was happily surprised that we got seats out on the deck overlooking the river. It was peaceful and when it got dark  staff promptly lit candles and took our drink orders.  We ordered sushi and it was flavorful and fresh. I would order their sushi again and maybe venture trying one of their speciality rolls although they are on the pricer side ($16 a roll). I like that they have different food stations dedicated to one type of food. It's nice to be drinking and still get quality food to go with your drinks.  I am not a beer drinker but my companions seemed to enjoy the beers they ordered. No complaints!  Will come again :-)\n",
      "This will be may be my last time here for brunch.  The omelet station had no meats. What am I paying for? I want an omelet with ham  bacon  something.  The last time I was here  there was fried chicken which I enjoyed nicely with waffles. I was looking forward to that this time and they did not have it. They have a nice view of the river but the brunch is nothing spectacular.\n",
      "Stick to the beer  my cucumber jalapeño margarita wasn't great. Food was good and really cool atmosphere.  Super relaxing and killer music.\n",
      "\n",
      "With more and more brewpubs popping up in the area  having the beer made on-site no longer has the novelty it once did.  These days  people want their $6 beers to actually taste good.  Maybe it's the fact the brewpub was made early in the game  maybe it's the fact the place will always get good business due to its location  but the effort at the brewpub feels phoned-in.  The beer selection can only be described as bland.  There are enough varieties  but none of them really stand out.  Definitely doesn't stand up to anything offered by Victory  Triumph or Gordon Biersch.  They do have a full-bar stocked with liquor and wine  but no outside beers.  The food is usually pretty good  no complaints except for what they serve up during their Sunday brunch.  The Sunday brunch sounds like a good deal  about $30 for all you can eat buffet-style food consisting of salmon  ham  prime rib and other high-quality foods.  However  when you see it in reality  it's very disappointing.  Snobby sounding food cooked poorly and served cold results in the tackiness of a crappy casino buffet in AC.  They do get good musical acts in during the weekends and the outdoor area is great during the summer.  Despite the quality of the beers themselves  it remains one of my favorite places in Manayunk to go attend during Friday and Saturday nights.\n",
      "SOLID food it's a little pricey for what they serve but the atmosphere is amazing. Very intimate spots throughout the room-  nice venue. Beer sucks but food makes up for it. Also a little Sushi joint in the place. Great place to check out.\n",
      "Awesome place!   Great Food  Great Beer  Great Atmosphere  and usually Great People. It's big  and there's lots of different bars in the place  even in the winter. Manayunk has been known to attract a meathead or two  but this place seems to be somewhat meathead-resistant. It's good to get there a little early  such as for dinner or happy hour - I've seen some long lines that form later in the night  and they might even charge a cover by then. Anyway  if you've been there  you know it's good. If you haven't  be sure to check it out. It's the best place in Manayunk  in my opinion.\n",
      "Maybe it's a good place to go for lunch or dinner  but as evening places go it's just awful. Evening staff are exceptionally rude  beer is complete garbage  and the DJ they had was seriously the worst I've ever heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Giving this three stars because when we went we got to sit outdoors and the deck is a great perk of the place  especially on nice warm days.   The place use to have really good sushi (have sushi chefs on staff) but I went last week and was pretty let down that for an $80 tab the sushi sucked and their beer is just so-so. Never eaten any of their other food but if we go again it looks like I will have to try since I'm not paying for their sushi again.   Recommend going for a drink or two on the deck to be outdoors but then venture elsewhere for food or the rest of the night.\n",
      "$1 Pabst Tallboys.    Coming from a state that doesn't believe in happy hour (it's against the law here in uptight MA)  or in its residents being very happy at all for that matter  the drink special alone did it for me.  Had a great veggie burger too.  Fun place to spend time post crust show at Troc.\n",
      "LOVE YOU MOM! & I love T Moms!!! (Sugar Moms too). You can still smoke upstairs by the bathrooms  2 pool tables upstairs in the front too! Veg. options.- Taco Tuesdays! Perogie Wednesdays! Cheap drinks! Jukebox is killer on both floors. Can't say a bad thing about the place... hands down a Philly landmark!\n",
      "Cheap beer  pretty girls  good punk-rock jukebox  50 cent pierogies  pool tables  two floors  bar and table seating. Nuff said.\n",
      "Ecto-Cooler colored walls have bathed my memories of Tattooed Mom in a greenish glow. Its gleam is not unlike that of an aquarium  in my mind. Coincidentally fish-style drinking has happened there over the years. Hmm.  The first floor is punk meets some ole granny's parlour. I kinda covet the light lime Victorian-y seating group  but I'd happily relax on any of those thrift store special sofa seats I could snag. Strange and comfortable. Good for hanging out.   There are alcoves and nooks and all manner of vintage kitsch surrounding you as you drink and possibly enjoy some 50 cent pierogies on Thurday nights. Even though deep frying pierogies isn't my favorite preparation of those fellas  I can still get down  and I have.   At the rail  the padded vinyl retro bar stools are like Queen Anne lounge-stools. Most comfortable bar stools in the business  I say. Perched there  I've mentioned to pretty much whoever I'm sitting next to at the time  \\What if I came in here like everyday and never talked to a soul and drank and drank while leering creepily at that nudie painting?\\\" Then I act it out for my lucky neighbor  licking my lips lecherously  drinking and staring unblinkingly at the topless broad in the oil painting above the bar. The gag gets some laughs but I'm thinking that it might be more successful if I looked more like Stan Zbornak. Gotta work on that.  Upstairs is covered with graffiti and plastered with posters and band flyers like the hallways of the punk clubs of my yoot. And I like it. Good jukeboxes here  indeed.  Now South Street is my touristy backyard and I do my share of complaining bout the hullabaloo and nonsense that it can attract. Weekend nights especially are when I steer clear. (Yeah that WAS me you saw dead-arm running across South  frantically uttering  \\\"Home  home  get home...\\\") It can be a zoo...but there are still places that we appreciate on the strip  and Tattooed Mom is one of em.   Not that weeknights don't get busy. Monday through Thursday's food specials draw. So do double happy hours.  5-7PM and then 10-11 PM  all drafts are half off. See  that's what's up.  Another thing  we're always treated really well at Mom's...and WE look like filthy hippies!\"\n",

      "Funny story:  Last Tuesday (snow day)  my friend and I decided to head to TM's for taco's and some mid-day pool.  As we were excitedly discussing Taco Tuesday  I said  \\I hope they're good tacos!\\\" to which my friend replied  \\\"It's hard to mess up a beef taco.\\\"    Flash forward 30 minutes: The upstairs is closed until 8p  no pool (boooo!) and we're eating $1 tacos out of stale taco shells.  Eek.  Anyways  this is a typical dive bar with cheap PBR's and a way hip/metal vibe.  Go to Manny Browns for your Taco Tuesdays.\"\n",
      "Tattooed Mom is one of the last artist-run artist-lead sanctuaries in Philly.  God bless you  T-Mom.  You look good for your age!  Also worth mentioning that Tattooed Mom actually offers every single item on their menu in vegetarian and vegan form.  Inclusivity at its best.  Go 'head girl!\n",
      "I love this place and I don't care who knows it.  I don't get out and party much anymore. But I wouldn't want to spend Halloween anywhere else. This was one of the places that started my love affair with Philadelphia. It's weird  kind of grimy  decently priced  and full of all kinds of flair. The owner is super sweet and likes to hang around and talk  especially on Sundays (when they have arts and crafts for free - yay!) The staff is cool and laid back  as is most of the clientele. While certainly a hipster/geek/whatever spot  you don't walk in to a bunch of judgmental assholes staring your down for your lack of flannel and neon sunglasses. I love the wacky retro furniture  the green walls downstairs  the bumper cars  the graffiti upstairs - all of it. It is relaxed and authentic and cool without trying to be. Love Love Love T-Moms.\n",
      "Love Tattooed Mom!   It's not a place you want to go to impress someone on a first date or for romance  but the food and beer are great. The staff is always friendly. I loving coming for the vegan tacos on Tuesdays and vegan burgers on Wednesdays. The happy hour specials are great and it's a great place to go to with friends.\n",
      "Mom's is the bomb!  Been coming here since they opened and have never been disappointed. Great food. Awesome beer selection. Fantastic bar and wait staff.   Decor is eclectic alt-pop-culture iconic. Crowd is local  punk  artist  et al...  Sunday brunch comes with craft table and is uber kid friendly (wether 8  28  or 58)!\n",
      "I don't get what all the hype is. Yes  this place is convenient and the closest thing to a diner on this part of South St.  but it's nothing to write home about. I just don't get all the hype. I find the crowd huddled on the steps every Saturday and Sunday morning amusing. It's just not the great.   First off...the waitstaff...I feel like they are constantly putting on a hipster act and that i am at one of those themed restaurants in Disney World where the staff is a group of struggling actresses and actors.   The last time I ate here I had an extremely bizarre experience involving what seemed to be a regular homeless customer yelling at the management for some chicken wings. We were of course waiting at that point around 1/2 hour for our table (in which 3 groups of hipster friends were sat before us despite their arrival time by their hipster hostess friend)   I can name at least 4 other breakfast/brunch places in town that Honey's doesn't even compare to.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a solid breakfast place with a diner feel. Cash only. It's not grungy or greasy. Great potato latkes (best with applesauce). Pancakes are love 'em or hate 'em (I loved them). Interesting menu  but also many of the standards  like omelettes. Honey Cristo is good. Fantastic weekday specials before 9 am.\n",
      "\n",
      "This will probably be my go-to neighborhood brunch place. Affordable prices  reasonable wait times (relative to other brunch places)  and **byob**! Orange juice by the pitcher for mimosas is listed as market price  which is a bit odd. But it was about $20 when we went. Worth it to check out. Get there early to avoid long waits!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yum! This place serves exactly what you'd picture when you think of a hearty  classic  traditional American breakfast. I enjoyed the bottomless coffee  and the waitress kindly brought me a small mini-pitcher of milk instead of cream when I asked. The wait can be long if you have a large group  but as a table for 2  we were seated immediately.   Also: CASH ONLY!\n",
      "Finally made it to Honey's! I came on a Wednesday afternoon to avoid the line on the weekend  and didn't have to wait  but it was still surprisingly busy. Overall  we had a great experience  and I look forward to coming back here in the future.  Honey's is Southern-inspired  and their decor is very vintage-y and rustic: a lot of wood  old signs  etc. I loved it!  While their regular menu looked great  their specials (written on the chalkboard on the wall) were what really caught my eye. The pecan pie pancakes were very intriguing  but I was in more of a savory mood  so I decided to get the Fried Cheese Grilled Cheese  which comes with tomato soup.   I was happy with my dish. The grilled cheese was scrumptious  and the caramelized onions were the perfect touch. While the tomato soup was a little salty  I liked having it to dip my grilled cheese into. I finished the whole thing  which is usually impossible for me and most brunch dishes  but I was stuffed.   Great experience overall  and would recommend it. The service was great as well. The only thing that takes away a star for me is the lack of a real \\oomph\\\" factor - I do think most of the dishes are traditional breakfast items  but cooked very well.\"\n",
      "I feel confident that I can bump Honey's up to a 4 star review after several more visits.  The Honey Cristo is truly great and the specials are always interesting and well executed.  My only remaining issue is that the omelets tend to be somewhat dry and cheeseless  which really doesn't do it for me.\n",
      "I was coaxed to try this place out again after a long absence. I'm glad I did! They changed their menu  and now tofu scramble just like ordering an omelette. They let you pick all your fixings to add into it. They also give you a much better portion of tofu than before. Thanks for making the change guys!  I still refuse to wait 90 minutes for a seat though. Go during off peak hours and get breakfast for dinner.\n",
      "I love salted cheese with black tea from Happy Lemon.  Ordered the same for A La Mousse.   It came in a tall beer glass  top with a thick layer of milk foam.  For the few sips   I got only the foams.  After a few sips  finally able to have the perfect sip with both in the mouth.  While it looks better in a tall beer glasses   it is not the perfect glass for this tea.  The tea actually tasted really good and cost $3.  Will order it again.\n",
      "Really distinct selection for Chinatown  very friendly service  and downright delicious desserts. The matcha mousse cake with matcha ice cream was excellent  and went great with their coffee. I also got to try the tiramisu  which was wonderful. My crew was looking for bubble tea (which A La Mousse does have)  and found so much more. I'll definitely be back.\n",
      "We ordered the Harvest  Lava cake and foam milk tea and they were delicious! Hot foam milk tea smells nice but the ice foam milk tea is also fantastic!  Must try their lava cake  they make it fresh.  Services was great too! Strongly recommend if you were near by.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered lava cake with butterscotch ice cream. It was very tasty and cheap compared to other places! I  absolutely recommend it!\n",
      "I'm a fan. This little place is just a few blocks from work and it's always a nice quick stop for a bite and a coffee after a particularly strenuous day. I love the chocolate mouse in whatever they make with it and their coffee is pretty good. 3.5 stars  rounded up.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a jewel box of a cafe. Charming  spotless  the most beautiful desserts. I had the matcha panna cotta and savored every bite. Not to be missed!\n",
      "I recently went back to A La Mousse on my birthday 12 21 2016. I felt like the atmosphere of this cafe changed. It was definitely much more crowded with loud obnoxious people. The staff changed so I also felt as if the quality of service has slightly decreased maybe because I went on a day where the usual staff isn't there. Even despite of the service  the desserts were as scrumcious as ever.\n",
      "A cute and unique dessert spot! Unfortunately when I went (at 10pm) they had already run out of the crepe cake which is what I wanted to try. I tried a bit of the sizzling ice cream  tiramisu and cheesecake though and they were all pretty good. Definite points for presentation.\n",
      "I have to give this restaurant 3 stars unfortunately even though I reall appreciated the ambiance and customer service.   Atmosphere: Great location  clean facilities and cute decor. Wasn't too loud as well so it was quite enjoyable.   Customer service: A+! Waiters were attentive and were helpful in giving suggestions for what to eat and specials.   Food: The dishes were underwhelming. I had a pasta and crab cake appetizer and my friend had the salmon and the food is quite salty and dry. Drinks were good though!  3 stars and would not recommend for a meal but would recommend for drinks!\n",
      "I went here for drinks  not dinner  so I can't comment on the food.  The atmosphere was pretty laid back though  and the peach wine was decently good.  It seems like a good place to grab a drink with a group \n",
      "Waited 15 minutes for server to greet the table  40 minutes for a Diet Coke and 70 minutes for food.  No apology whatsoever.\n",
      "Amazing food  incredibly decorated restaurant! We came for brunch  and they have bottomless mimosas and a DJ playing a really good mix of music. Franco was our waiter  and he's awesome! Very hospitable. I will definitely be back! I hear in the warmer months they open up all the windows for a nice breeze and added ambience!\n",
      "I came here for the first time for a friends bridal shower. We sat outside on a hot day  but we had a good breeze coming along our way so we were good. Our waiter was very friendly and came to check on us pretty often. I got their Bloody Mary and it was extremely alcoholic for me to finish (I guess it's a good thing that they're not cheap with their alcohol). I also got their mushroom risotto and it was absolutely delicious. My friend got their chicken parm  and it was HUGEEE and delicious. I would come back here again.\n",
      "Service was lackluster  food was fresh and prompt  the $12 mixed drinks from the bar were horrible - overall will not return\n",
      "Wonderful food. Refreshing tastes on the menu. When you are sick of the same old. Want a touch of daring to go with some simple tapas. We enjoyed the food and the beautiful decor. Our service was also very good. I have never been a fan of close  two tops together. So intimacy is not achieved for guests on a busy night indoors. But the outside seating for the summer looks nice.   It is located on the cobblestone in Old City with a pretty view when outside.\n",
      "I went to Positano Coast for the first time last night for a friend's birthday dinner.  It was very busy  but since our group of six had a reservation  we were seated promptly.  The restaurant was larger than I thought and extremely loud.  I felt like I had to shout to be heard by the people at my own table.  I didn't have an appetizer  but others in my party did and enjoyed them.  I ordered the seafood risotto.  My meal came out several minutes after the others.  This was the best part of my experience - provided of course  that it was done purposely.  I know that sounds counter intuitive  but it really isn't.  Risotto can't wait.  It must be served immediately.  The fact that my meal was delivered last means that the kitchen staff timed the meals so that my risotto wouldn't have to wait.  I was very impressed by that. Again  provided that it was done purposely.  The risotto had a very nice flavor and the seafood wasn't overcooked.  To my taste  the rice didn't have a chance to cook long enough (or the risotto wasn't stirred long enough) to allow the starch to thicken the broth.  This made it quite good  but not exceptional.  For dessert  I had the vanilla creme brulee.  It was good  but  again  not exceptional.  I found the portions for both the risotto and creme brulee undersized which also made them less than exceptional.  If I was with a group who really wanted to eat there  I would go back.  However  I wouldn't see out Positano Coast.\n",
      "Just went for apps  that were great! The deck seating is great too. My only concern is that we went at sunset  and the sun was BLINDING on the deck. maybe some elegant white translucent curtains over parts of the deck would be nice. otherwise  the food and service was great. we only had 30-ish minutes and the waiters were prompt and put our orders ahead so we wouldn't miss our movie (aww  what sweethearts!!). we ordered a fresh stuffed mozzarella cheese dish and it was to die for. I've never had cheese that was so delicate  but flavorful. Also  the beet and arugula salad was deliciously dressed. I'd recommend this place to anyone with a love of real Italian foods.\n",
      "Came here with friends for appetizers and drinks.  We ordered the mushroom arancini  Peruvian scallops  meat and cheese plate  and burrata cheese.  Every single dish was amazingly delicious.  The low sofas and tables lended a nice atmosphere and our waiter (Nick) was awesome.  Highly recommend!\n",
      "If I had to judge this place on the front desk order girl ~ it would be a \\1\\\". Seriously BAD customer service. We ordered 3 different sandwiches...chicken cheese steak  hot roast beef w provolone cheese and beef w cheese whiz. I can't give any great reviews...the beef was very salty...half the chicken sandwich was missing the toppings...no refills on drinks...and the girl is SO NOT interested in talking w their  customers re: orders. truly terrible service...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Great food  great service. Johnny has an good infectious attitude that really sets the tone of the visit. More Italian oriented  great Philly cheesesteak!  #foodcoma\n",
      "My steak was 10 dollars...way too expensive. But considering the fact that this is Center City  I should have known better. They use a really high quality of meat and the steak is juicy. But for me it was a bit flavorless and the chunks of beef were a bit too big. Although the bathroom was really clean when I had to take a \\cheesesteak\\\" in the toilet. It was quite funny when other patrons banged on the with their \\\"cheesesteaks\\\" too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered delivery here through TryCaviar and didn't experience any problems in the wait times/quality of the food.  In fact  it came quicker than expected.  We got the marinated mozzarella sandwich and the wing ding buffalo sandwich.  I would agree with the other reviews that the sandwiches are pretty pricy (generally all were over $10)  but you do get a lot of food.  I was a little upset with the roll because I ordered seeded Italian and got regular  which is understandable if they were out  but the rolls we received were not as fresh and soft as I would have liked  kind of like they were a day old.  Hence  why I dropped a star.  The fillings in the sandwich were delicious and on point.  I was not feeling meat that particular day  so I opted for their veggie options. The marinated mozzarella was absolutely delicious and covered in fresh tomato and a flavorful basil dressing - the mozzarella was super soft and tasty.  VERY salty marinade  but the acidic tomatoes helped cut through it.  My BF loved his wing ding sandwich and said it was very spicy and had a really good homemade blue cheese dressing on it.  After tax  service fees and delivery  it came to about $30  which is pricy for sandwiches so maybe next time we'll eat there instead and waive the delivery fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know the reviews are mixed  but tried it anyway. No  the staff isn't warm and fuzzy  but when there's a line out the door and it's hot and humid  I don't think I would be either. They weren't mean  but matter-of-fact. The cheesesteak was very good  better than the other places I've had in town.\n",
      "Based on recommendations from some Philly regulars  we decided to avoid the long lines and rivalry between Pat and Geno. There were decent reviews about Campo's and it was located along our route  so we stopped here instead.  The good: My cheesesteak (Whiz wit) was decent. I'm not a big steak eater  so if I ever come back  I will likely try their vegan/vegetarian options and see if I like them better.  This location is also really convenient for tourists checking out the nearby historical sites  without the giant crowd of tourists at other popular cheesesteak spots. We didn't feel like we were missing out on anything. There is also outdoor seating.  The meh: We were there during Fourth of July  and although we were able to watch the parade from the comfort of the deli's indoor seating  it was still pretty warm inside. Maybe they had fans on  but the window was opened to allow best visibility  so any a/c would have been inefficient. I can't imagine what it was like in the kitchen that day.  Would I recommend to someone else? Yes. For someone like me  who just wants a decent cheesesteak but skip the long lines with lots of tourists  or for someone who wants to try a variety of cheesesteaks while in Philly  Campo's is a good choice.\n",
      "The service was quick. The quality of the meat was good. I guess my expectations for an authentic philly cheese steak was more. I cant really put my finger on it though.  I chose the provolone cheese  perhaps a messier cheese would have been better.\n",
      "\\Great decor and ambience. Friendly staff. Overpriced and uninspired food ($10+ single link of housemade sausage  $9 for single slab of pork belly  etc.  $300 for what you see on their website)\\\"  Food was good but slightly overpriced and lacking in inspiration.  Sausages were good but lacked fat. They were a bit dry. And remember it's $10+ for a single link of sausage.  Burger tasted very similar to a Big Mac! Which is not a bad thing. Two patties. Very juicy. With toasted white buns. Without any sides. Fairly overpriced.  Pork belly slab was tasty. $9 for a single slab.  The restaurant is actually very big and seating extends way into the fenced back yard! Lovely decoration and design. Very friendly staff.\"\n",
      "Surprisingly  a place called butcher bar has AMAZING vegetarian options.  The eggplant meatballs are absolutely dope and the cauliflower steak is extremely tasty.  The drinks in the place are awesome especially the win win  gin cocktail that has a jolt of citrus in it as well.  Overall  awesome loud atmosphere  the bar is a fun spot to people watch and the service has been great so far (3rd visit in 4 months)\n",
      "Had a great time at Butcher Bar tonight. Food was flavorful  quickly served  and hearty. We loved the poutine and the Italian meatballs in particular! Prices are reasonable and drinks are great. Cool atmosphere -- theming was on point. Open air front helped us to take advantage of the beautiful weather  and we hear there is a courtyard coming soon. Service was fantastic.. For being open less than a week  already feels like a well oiled machine with a great  courteous  and attentive staff. Billy in particular was great -- friendly  helpful  and wonderful stories. We will certainly be back soon.\n",
      "Went in for lunch  got the duck wings (9/10) sauce was really saucy and good a lot of flavor  duck was flavorful and was fried well.   Got the Steak  aaaand the problems began. For a $31 steak it was not cooked to order. When it arrived it looked very nice and aesthetically pleasing but the steak was un evenly re-heated. room temp in some places and warm/hot in others. When I told the waiter this they just reheated it under a lamp or something... and the medium rare became over cook.... at that point I just ate it and the sauce from the duck.  Taste like Chinese food when you have like beef and broccoli  which wasn't actually bad but it was still not really evenly heated..... if you over cook it might as well over cook it all?...  The service was good  our waiter was real nice and personable.   Sat outside in the summer which is also nice.   TL:DR if you messed up a $31 lunch steak  you should just re make me one  not re heat it un evenly and over cook it.\n",
      "Really cool and intimate atmosphere with limited seating upstairs and small bar downstairs next to the open kitchen. Drink selection was spot on with the butcher's punch. Paired nicely with the strip steak. The starters were overall pretty good  nothing spectacular. We probably could have had our whole meal on cured meats and sausages. I would get the sloppy joe poutine again  but the monkey bread was not worth a second go around. Strip steak was awesome with a side of nicely sautéed and or grilled veggies. Will def. be back for more cheese meat boards and drinks.\n",
      "Great steakhouse without the boners in suits.  Duck wings A+ Smoked slab A+  Ribeye A+\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok so the steak and Mac and cheese was delicious (oh the bacon). When the dessert option was highly recommended by the waiter I was sold. I was excited to try the dessert and realized it's was the most expensive option so I told my friend that I'm probably going to get the most expensive one but turns out the menu he had  the price was different (lower) for the same exact dessert. I was the waitstaff if he could explain it and he said no he could not but would charge me the lower price. First: why me  as a woman  was given the more higher priced menu while my male friend had the lower price. And second: why could you not explain the different prices  \\hey that menu was old price  your is new\\\" etc. maybe the couple next to us had a different priced menu targeted specifically for them. Who knows. I wouldn't take take a chance and go to this place.\"\n",
      "Later review:  I had such a great time at brunch this past Sunday and I wanted to rave about it.The employees are amazing and pay great attention to you whether you're there with a group or alone. The bartenders do a great job and make delicious specialty cocktails. I really enjoyed my bacon infused vodka bloody mary and had their classic eggs benedict. I came in for drinks again the following evening and the bartender remembered my face and made me feel very welcomed.\n",
      "Everything we had was great! The pork ribs  duck wings  and octopus entree were all delicious! And the warm chocolate chip cookie hit the spot at the end!\n",
      "This restaurant was seriously impressive. Everything was completely delicious: the guacamole  the flatbread  the cocktails  some beef taco thing... extremely good food and priced fairly for high end Mexican. The sundae thing with the caramel corn... eh. Not as amazing as some reviews led me to believe. But totally edible.  The dining room is attractive with a Velasquez-like mural. It's modern and approachable while remaining warm and neighborhoody. I sent my parents here and they really liked it as well.   The service was excellent. I told the server that \\I can't eat egg \\\" by which I only meant that I find it gross. So they put some hard boiled egg pico de gallo on the side for my friend. But the waitress came back a few minutes later presenting the chef's concern that I had a dairy allergy  as some of the other food had dairy. That's so nice! Way to look out for your diners.   This restaurant must prosper because it is awesome and close to my house. Go there. Love it. This is absolutely the restaurant Fairmount needed.\"\n",
      "Upscale Mexican-fusion restaurant in Fairmount area.  Hamachi Ceviche was delicious. Fish tacos were excellent. Chorizo fundido was awesome Campechano Tlayuda hit the spot.  Great assortment of tequilas to try as well.  Only knock were the flour tortillas instead of corn (you can ask for corn instead).\n",
      "Decent but nothing too memorable. Portions were small for the price and al pastor was a tad dry. Baja fish tacos only came with 2 tacos.There are not many other Mexican restaurants in the area  but I still prefer Que Chula and they deliver to my house.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is overrated. I've been here a bunch of times and every time I think to myself \\there are so many better places to go on Fairmount.\\\" The food drinks are overpriced (except for during happy hour) and the margaritas are poured from a bottle. The happy hour nachos are the only thing I would recommend  everything else is just meh.\"\n",
      "Great place.  They really get the whole restaurant experience.  Not your typical Mexican place  but with plenty of typical fare.  Some really extraordinary dishes to compliment traditional favorites.  People are great and interior is very appealing.  Family friendly and also plays to those who are unrestrained by kids.  The overall experience leaves you feeling quite pleased!\n",
      "Had the opportunity to come here after picking up a friend from the airport last week.  This was a great choice!  The decor is funky and inviting  and the space itself is relly beautiful.  A teensy drawback is that  when people are loud  it can be hard to hear your tablemates  but since we were seated to a party of 10 ladies reliving their sorority days  that's hardly the fault of the establishment.   -)  There were three of us and we shared hamachi ceviche (yummy!)  pulpo skewers (awesome!)  the fish tacos  carnitas  tlayudas  and then dessert.  The ironically titled Domingo Sundae and some ice cream - so good!  I live in a more suburban area and the chance to get to a place in a walkable  urban neighborhood was a nice change of pace!  I'd come back to La Calaca Feliz anytime!\n",
      "Back in Philly and in the mood for happy hour with my wife.  She recommended La Calaca  so off we went.  The happy hour menu is fantastic.  The regular menu is equally good.  The Lobster Tacositas were tasty (a mini version of a lobster roll) and had just the proper amount of spice.  The contrasting textures made me muy feliz.  The nachos with brisket were a welcome surprise.  They came out of the oven and had the right crunchiness.  The cheese and the toppings did not overwhelm the crunchy  fresh-out-of-the-oven chips.  The highlight tonight was the Carnitas Tacos.  These were the best carnitas I've had in the states.  They had a little burn on the outside but maintained their juicy quality nonetheless.  The bartender also recommended the fish tacos (they are prepared with plantain before the frier).  There are also a couple of flatbreads on the menu.  Our love of asparagus pushed us to order the asparagus option with manchego béchamel.  It was fantastic.  The service was great.  The bartender was attentive but not annoying.  There was only one mistake all afternoon.  The asparagus flatbread was delivered to the bar with jalapeños  although we ordered them without.  However  we just picked them out of my wife's half and placed them into mine and thoroughly enjoyed the dish.  I know Calaca has been around for a bit.  It still remains a great place for solid Mexican staples in Philly.  There are tons of fresh ingredients and carefully prepared dishes  you won't find heavy-handed Tex-Mex dishes a-la Chilli's here.  I will be back for more items on the menu.\n",
      "Love the ambiance and food was delicious.  Waiter was nice.  So why 3 stars?  Because I spent a good amount but left the restaurant still hungry.  If you order tacos  you get 3 little tacos and nothing else.  The plate is totally bare: no beans  no rice  nothing.  How much would it cost them to add a little filler on the side so that the customer doesn't leave hungry?  I have mixed feelings about coming back.  Maybe I'll ask the nice waiter next time which meals can actually fill up a person (rather than a newborn baby hamster).  Good for kids.\n",
      "My dad  who is consistently \\underwhelmed\\\" by most restaurants was happy when I took him here.   To start  my brother ordered us the crab fondito and it was delicious. My dad kept complaining that it was not good for his diet...yet kept digging his fork in for more.   For dinner I ordered the carnitas tacos  my father ordered the baja tacos  and my brother had the fried chicken taco special. First off  a fried chicken taco? Sounds strange. While I did not taste it my brother was very happy and cleaned off his plate pretty fast. My father loved his baja taco. My carnitas was delicious  although not the best I've ever had  but still quite good. For sides we had the plantains (tasty!) and brussel sprouts (also good!)  Service was friendly and attentive. Will be back.\"\n",
      "I love this place. They have a great selection of beer that is ever changing as well as some great specials at happy hour and on Sundays (half price pork dishes). Their salads are great and so is anything else I've tried on the menu. I haven't been disappointed yet! Be warned  it's a small place so be prepared to wait on a weekend but it might be better now that they've added the upstairs.  Update: Try the Reuben  you will not regret it. Tastes delicious and homemade!\n",
      "I met my wife here  so this ranking pains me. But the menu is getting old. However  they also always have IPAs  which is rarity in Philadelphia  so for eating it gets a \\Meh\\\" but for beer it gets a \\\"must visit.\\\"\"\n",
      "Came here to try the burgers. Not really impressed. It was average food  not bad  just average. Decent beer selection. Service was average. All around a good experience. They won't wow you  but they will satisfy you! I wouldn't mind if I came back some day.\n",
      "10 30 PM on a Thursday night  and this place was fairly packed. Most seats had bottoms.   It was rather dark  as Allison B.  said  but I had no problem seeing.   I pleaded and pleaded with my friend so that we would stay until midnight for part of the appetizer menu that would become half-off  but no...his bedtime is early.   From our friendly waiter  we each ordered beers ($4-$5) on tap  and they were decent! (for my wallet. Or rather  his wallet.)  We also ordered the plate of onions rings  which when it came  surprised us! There was a bed of fresh salad on the side - to offset the crispy-fried-batter-worthy-of-a heartburn.  Overall  it was yum  and to satisfy that happy hour little girl inside of me  I'm coming back.\n",
      "I live right around the corner from Sidecar  and my friend lives right down the block. One of our favorite things is to go in on a Sunday night and hang out with Adam the bartender. Nothing crazy  just a few beers and an order of fries with their amazing spicy mayo. For such a cozy  intimate spot  they have a killer beer selection.  I couldn't ask for a better corner bar. Other highly enjoyable items at Sidecar are the pulled pork and a small but well chosen dessert menu.\n",
      "4 stars very close to 5. My friend got this mushroom polenta vegetarian dish that I basically ate for her it was so delicious. They have a lot of happy hour late night specials so it's an especially top-notch neighborhood bar. It even has some outdoor seating which is especially rare and nice in Philly. Love!\n",
      "100% found pubes coarse hair in our fries today. So disgusting. Only giving two stars because I love the black bean burger too much to give less.\n",
      "We've been living in Philly for about five months now and a few places have emerged as neighborhood favorites and The Sidecar Bar & Grille tops the list. Mainly  we have been going for their fabulous Sunday brunch  but we have also visited once for dinner and it was equally enjoyable.  Recently  they have opened the second floor which is a comfortable  sun-filled room that is ideal for brunch.   The one time we were there for dinner  I have a wonderful special of mussels and homemade sausage over cannellini beans. For brunch  I tend to gravitate to the Crabby Benny or the Huevos Rancheros. Whatever you do  get the bread basket. It changes weekly but has always been delicious whether it's the Chocolate Chip Pumpkin Bread or the Crumb Cake or whatever.  And the beer list is to die for. They always have a nice variety of styles from a wide-assortment of breweries  usually featuring local brews. When we were last there  we were thrilled to find they still had Stone Vertical Epic 11/11/11.  We were out of town one weekend recently and were totally having Sidecar brunch withdraw.\n",
      "Always a good time.  Great beers  and OK food.    A little crowded sometimes  but overall worth the wait.\n",
      "First time visiting this establishment and overall  very good. I made a meal out of \\lil sumthings on the sides\\\"--biscuit  country gravy  eggs over easy  and cheese grits. Everything was really tasty and the portions more than satisfying. I got a Bloody Mary that wasn't spicy to my liking but ok if crafting for the masses. The wait staff was very polite and attentive even during the busy brunch. Overall  a good experience and while I don't live close enough to make frequenting convenient  definitely good to know this option exists.\"\n",

      "I was out in Philliy for a night out and wanted to get a cheesesteak. I expected this place to be nothing less than amazing due to great reviews it received. For starters my chicken cheese steak had zero salt and pepper. I was eating bland meat with ketchup and onions. I waited in line for 15 minutes just to be disappointed. I really wanted to like this place  unfortunately it was a disappointment. Would rather go to pats and get their wiz cheese.\n",
      "Literally asked the guy if I can order pick up  mind you I waited 2 mins for someone to pick up the phone. After he said no phone orders after 3 he hung up IMMEDIATELY. Didn't give me a chance to ask any further questions. I understand this place has good ratings  but don't get fooled by their horrible customer service. I rather go to steves or genos and take the 20 min extra car ride  at least I'll get better CUSTOMER SERVICE\n",

      "If it's good enough for Rick Ross (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKJy4GSLA10)  it's good enough for me.  This has actually become my favorite place for steaks in Philly.  Every other place bores me in comparison to Max's.  My man behind the grill is a true entertainer and a master griller.  He somehow manages to take orders  man the grill  keep orders straight  keep people from getting pissed off  and construct an outstanding sandwich.  This is quite the feat considering how packed this place can get.  As mentioned by others  the giant his HUGE.  Not only is it twice as long as a normal steak anywhere else  but they pack it with meat and anything else you want on it.  Because there is so much meat  it can get a bit dry so I suggest getting whiz over American and maybe adding some ketchup (or your condiment of choice).  I consider myself a big eater  and I can't finish a giant in one sitting.  I tried hard because it was so tasty but had to give up.  A giant will run you somewhere in the neighborhood of $15.  As an added bonus  Max's sells beer for takeout.  It is also connected to the Eagle Bar  which looked like a nice place--people seemed to be enjoying themselves.\n",
      "My favorite spot in Philly for cheesesteaks... it is in the hood...reminds me of 125th street or fordham road back in the late 80s or 90s ... if you're not comfortable in the hood I suggest you go early or in with a few ppl .. ..  Cheap prices especially for beer...they even sell 40s ... :)..\n",
      "Finally made it to the infamous Max's Steaks...  While this spot has been around for years the movie Creed made it more popular and touristy. It's located on the corner of a urban area in North Philly. The outside isn't the prettiest. Extremely small parking lot located next door. You have to rely on street parking if you strike out. A bus stop is directly in front of Max's as well as the street car stop a few feet away so be prepared to possibly deal with some interesting personalities on your way in.  I felt like I had the luck of good timing when I pulled up because I didn't see a line going out the door and around the corner....little did I know that this just the beginning! When you enter you will see signs that say \\order here\\\" and \\\"pay here\\\". However  it can get a little confusing to those that don't know the \\\"process\\\".   You kinda have to step back and wait around for them to call you once you sandwich is ready for the toppings. In the meantime you are hoping and praying that they don't confuse people and orders because it's not like they are relying on a number/name system or something. It's all about \\\"hey you  you're next\\\" type of thing.   I decided to snap a quick picture of the steak/onions being cooked on the grill. The cook kinda dodged out of the way of the pic  gave me a strange look and said \\\"Where are you from sweetie?\\\" I said \\\"From Maryland  why what's up?\\\" Again he looks at me side-eye and another worker yells out \\\"WE DON'T LIKE PICTURES UP IN HERE!\\\" Now y'all Yelpers know me right?! So  I looked at him and said oh really!? Well  where is the sign for that? Where is the sign that says no pics?! I'm like y'all have 50 gazillion other signs in here that scream \\\"NO TIPS\\\" \\\"NO TIPPING\\\" BUT YET AND STILL I CLEARLY SEE YOU EXCEPTING TIPS FROM CUSTOMERS?!!? And I'm not even going to get started on the other pics that are already on Yelp AND the few Youtube videos I came across of people recording getting there food made! Who does that? LOL Oh ok  clearly that's how they roll here. I have no problem with respecting how they feel about pictures being taken. What I do have a problem with is that you clearly know this a tourist attraction mainly due to you allowing them to film part of a movie here and you have all these no tipping signs...MAKE A SIGN OR TWO THAT SAYS \\\"NO PICTURES ALLOWED!\\\" or even \\\"NO LOITERING\\\" for all of your \\\"friendly\\\" people that linger around your spot. I mean geesh  signs are not super expensive to order and install! SMH! This bothered me BUT I remained optimistic for good food and chalked it up to where I was...  So  I decided to just sip my tea  wait patiently on this steak and cheese and hope and pray it's not as dry as the steak was looking on the grill cause it look like it was being overcooked. There were 3 people in front of me waiting for there food...it literally took about about 30 minutes for my order to be ready! For the life of me I can't understand what takes so long...the steak is basically already cooked. All you are doing is melting cheese  adding toppings  cut  wrap and out you go. I would understand the wait more if the food was being prepared as order but it is not.  Last but not least  2 sandwiches came up to almost $20.  Gave the cashier the $20  she gave a nice smile with that same look she gave the other customers that were tipping IN SPITE OF THE \\\"NO TIPPING\\\" SIGN! I left a tip in spite of what had happened SMH I sssooo wanted to say \\\"Can I get pic of that?!?\\\" just for the hell of it?! LMAO!   My sandwich was good but the meat was too overcooked for me. It was seasoned very well but just way too overcooked. North Philly is a little out of the way from where I usually go and unfortunately nothing about this sandwich made me want to drive all the way back here...\"\n"

      "I haven't had a Max's cheesesteak in years so i was looking forward to it. The steak was mediocre  not much taste. I think the problem is the salt and pepper need to be added while it's cooking. And then there was a little too much grease (is there such a thing?). I might go back in the future...maybe.\n",
      "m not totally sure why I hadn't been to Eulogy in so long. Sure  it's in a spot that annoying to drive to  and weekend night here are more crazy than that of the zoo. But my love of beer and food should bring me here more often.  Eulogy has a lot in common with Monk's: Excellent Belgian bars with great tap and bottle lists. They both have great food  including mussels  and also sport multiple bars with different taps. So far  everything is great. But I'm not just going to write a comparison between the two  because it might just be boring.  I've been on a quest for my favorite burger in Philly  but after eating too many fist-thick pub burgers  I decided to scale back a bit. Still  I've heard good things about the burger here  so I couldn't resist. The result? A perfectly cooked  shaped and seasoned burger. Burgers come with your choice of cheese and one topping. Cheddar and leeks did me very well. It's easily one of my top burger spots in the city. I also tried the white wine mussels. These are also a delicious choice.  Now throw some of the best beer selection in the city on top? Eulogy makes good use of their bar to serve up a Belgian heavy menu  while also keeping a few excellent domestic beers. I started out with Kwak Amber. It was a delicious beer  and could only be outdone by me next choice  Gulden Draak. These are some of the premier beers in the world  available only a short bike ride from my house. The Draak comes in at %10.5  but is so well crafted you can't even tell. Sure  it's $9 a glass  but that doesn't change my recommendation.  I visited over lunch  so it was pretty slow and the staff was restocking a bit and moving things around. But the food still came out quickly  and the bartender was on top of the service. To boot  he was also really cool. I'm sure it's a trend with most who work here.  Bottom Line: Come here ready to eat  drink  and have an excellent time. Make sure you have your wallet  because the bill can add up quickly  especially with the beer. This is one of the top spots in the Olde City  and my favorite Belgian spot in Philly.\n",
      "What could possibly be said here that hasn't been said already? It's just one of the best beer bars I've ever been to. Great spot.   And I really should know since I bleed beer. No  seriously. It's true! My blood is like a nice 11.5% trippel. Hints of floral and spiced pear on the nose with thick three finger head. Beautiful lacing on the glass. The taste starts hoppy and spicy but washes with a mellow sweetness. My blood that is.\n",
      "The mussels are delicious and its the best fish and chips in the city.  The beer menu is insane.  Our server really knew what she was talking about and made great recommendations.  It was our first time  and we will definitely be back.\n",
      "Great beer  but terrible service. After returning to my hometown for a weekend  I was excited to catch up with a group of friends at eulogy. We had reservations  sat down  ordered some drinks (which we did get in a timely manner) but waited 45 mins and were then told by our waiter (in a pretty unfriendly tone) that there was a \\computer glitch\\\" in the food ordering system  and that it may be \\\"15 minutes.\\\" and then he asked us if we wanted to leave. What?! Another half hour later  still no food  no manager (even though we asked to speak to one) and people around us were getting food  yet our waiter barely acknowledged us. We eventually walked out and the manager gave us free drinks. The most bizarre   terrible experience and we will not be going back.\"\n",
      "Best Mussels in philly. Located in old city  it's a divey bar. Get the dijon mussels- so good!!!!!!! Garlicy and mustardy but super flavorful. 8.99 for a lb  not bad and it comes with some bread. Amazing beer selection as well!\n",
      "Had business lunch.  Good beer  good mussels  good fries. Knowledge friendly accommodating staff.\n",
      "The best mussels in the city!  The bartenders have a great knowledge of beer  just tell them what you like and they will find you an excellent beer.  The place is a bit of a dive but the food and beers are worth it!  Go upstairs to avoid the crowds.\n",
      "I really like this place  and it's for very simple reasons.  The staff are always friendly and nice to me.  They know their product through and through.  They are like beer therapists here  guiding you to the right choice.  Every time I go I essentially see the same staff.  To me  low turn over is a good thing  it means these people know what they are doing.  The food is good.  I like the burger and fries a lot.  They are not greasy or dripping in oil.  They are fresh and tasty!  The sauces are good too. I can't speak for the rest of the food  it looks and smells great  but I just always get the burger.  You can't beat the beer selection.  I know people rave about Monks' and I like that place but Eulogy  to me has got them beat.    It does get crowded Fri. & Sat. nights.  It can be a pain to get a seat.  If that happen it happens  no big deal.  I like this place enough that I don't really care.  If I can't get a seat  I'll juts try again another time.  It's not going anywhere  and I'll be back at some point.  This a great place.  Normally it's the first place I tell anybody about whenever they ask me a question about Philly.    If beer is you thing  this is the place.  At the very least  it's definitely worth going to at least once to SEE the menu and try SOMETHING.  One of my happy spots!\n",
      "Eulogy is always a great time. I don't make it out to Old City much  but when I do  I always try to visit. The beer selection is epic and the food is awesome - try the \\beer mussels!\\\" It can get pretty packed on the weekends  but I don't think it feels as cramped as some of the other Old City staples.   Be aware that they don't take reservations for parties greater than a certain amount - greater than 4 people  I think.  Quick story:  We went here on an extended lunch break at work one time. We were seated upstairs and were the only ones there. So  the waiter asked us if we wanted to listen to some music  we answered in the affirmative. He takes out his iPod plugs it in and asks was we want to hear. We say  'anything.' He looks at us pensively  considers carefully  and responds  'you guys look like Radiohead kinda guys \\\" and proceeds to put on 'OK Computer' by Radiohead.   I always find this story amusing because I'm not sure what a Radiohead fan looks like or if it is just a safe pick because lots of people like Radiohead. Either way  I enjoyed it and we had a good time.  Would absolutely recommend stopping by if you're in Old City.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Still one of my favorite spots hands down... Atmosphere is great  food is even better... recommend this to everyone that steps foot into Northern Liberties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh how i miss you  faithful friend  you might still be my most comfortable and happy spot in Philly. Wings and pork tenderloin and pulled pork and mussels in coconut curry...oh gastro pal  see you as soon as possible...hope everyone checks you out and gets the fish and chips.\n",
      "We came here for brunch because sometimes  the line out the door for \\that other place nearby\\\" is just too overwhelming on an empty stomach on a Saturday almost-noon.  They didn't disappoint-- my boyfriend enjoyed his mimosa (though it was very tiny for the price) and his chili and cornbread thing (I forget what it was called)  and I settled for the Belgian waffle with chocolate chips and whipped cream. You know  gotta start my day off right with a wholesome  balanced and nutritious meal. (Sometimes chocolate wins).  I would go here again. The seating is nice and cozy  and the staff was friendly. But  it isn't the best brunch I've ever had  and I do have two places I prefer. For a THIRD option though  it's fitting that North THIRD (I kill myself with my own bad jokes!) is right around the corner.\"\n",
      "great neighborhood pub  where everything exceeds you expectations.  Truthfully nothing pops on the menu  so you usually fall back on a dish that promises mediocrity then ends up delivering the goods. The biscuits and sausage gravy are no joke.  Great beer menu too.\n",
      "Tried a handful of times and it looks nice from the kerb  but frankly doesn't cut it when compared to any number of similar places within a few blocks. The menu was fine but a bit dull  the food quality was fine but not brilliant  mediocre even  the beer selection was fine but pales in comparison to the neighbors. Plus the service was consistently poor  every time.  If you go  it'll be a fine time  it's a nice enough place and most anywhere else in the city would be a solid bar. I've never been for brunch  though  so maybe that's what I'm missing.   Actually  what am I saying...go here  this place is the best  and stay away from the bars I'd rather go to.\n",
      "Best damn biscuits and gravy I have had in a minute -- it came with eggs  potatos  and sausage.   It came out stupid quick  too.  If I wasn't fighting a cold  I would have tried one of many delicious looking mimosas.\n",
      "still great wings  and Steve  Colin  Nacene and Lisa are all great staff members!\n",
      "North Third is a good old Northern Liiberties standby!  Food is always good  and they take good care of my pooch.  nothing here is ever BLOWING me away  so I am giving it a 3 since there is nothing wrong at all and I strongly recommend this place.  Its just that they don't have a few things that they do better than any place else.  My favorite is the chicken sandwich with guacamole.  Service is always very good  and the food is always good as well - if you are a local this place is a staple  if you are not don't jump in a cab to come all the way over.\n",
      "So  my girlfriends took me out for a pre-bday bar hop and I didn't want to leave this spot. I had so much fun at this bar. The music  ambiance  and drinks were great. We selected the Vegetable Spring Rolls with Sweet Chile Sauce as our appetizer  and I ordered a Blood Orange Margarita. My friends are beer drinkers  which they enjoyed the drinks On Tap. The art decor is amazing  and any man would enjoy the beautiful  nude women plastered on their walls. The bar maid was very accommodating and patient with my friends that wanted to sample the ales. I can't wait to go back to have a meal  and a couple more Blood Orange Margaritas -)\n",
      "Went here with my parents and my brother after ice skating. Had a wonderful evening. Food was absolutely fantastic. For appetizers  we got the fried mozzarella and the spinach and artichoke dip. Probably the best that I've had in a while. For dinner  I had the fettuccine Alfredo and pomegranate italian soda. Both were yummy. Our server Ashton was awesome and very attentive. Overall  great place to go for a filling dinner. Will definitely return!\n",
      "\n",
      "Big fan of Maggiano's.  For me it ranks a little behind Carmine's as far as family style Italian joints go  but its pretty darn good.  Been to this particular location on a few occassions.  One of which was New Years Eve with a party of about a dozen.  Wait staff is great and they replenish the food and drinks rather quickly.  Never had anything I didn't enjoy here.  A little tough to dine with just a party of two because the portions are so large.  I recommend a group of 4 or more and make reservations.  The first time we attempted to dine here a few years ago we were told it was an hour and a half wait.  If you love Italian then I don't think Maggiano's will disappoint you.\n",
      "I came here for the first time last Sunday with a party of 14. My girlfriend and her cousins were taking their grandparents out for a surprise lunch in the city. We were early for our noon reservation  but were seated immediately. We had 2 waiters for our table  and both were very good. No one had to wait at any time through the meal for a refill on their drinks. We ordered everything family style. For appetizers we had the fried calamari  stuffed mushrooms  and Maggianos salad. The calamari was obviously frozen  and had way to much breading. Not impressive. The stuffed mushrooms were very good. The stuffing consisted of breadcrumbs  spinach  and mozzarella. For our entrees we had the chicken parm  4 cheese ravioli  salmon  and the spinach and chicken manicotti. The chicken parm was dry. There was barely any marinara sauce on top  and it did not come with spaghetti noodles  just the breast on the plate. The salmon had a lemon taste to it  and was not of a high quality. I would not recommend it. The ravioli were tender and had a good taste. The best dish was by far the manicotti. If I returned here  I would get that. For dessert  we had the cheesecake and apples and ice cream. Both were very good  but nothing special. The service was top notch however  all the way through the end of the meal. With all the excellent Italian places in Philly  it is hard to say I would go back here for average food. I will say  that as far as Italian chain restaurants go  this was the best I have been to.\n",
      "Yes its a chain.  You cant really tell its a chain though......  I've been here multiple times in the last few years.  I have always had decent service and thought the food was good to really good.  If you want to try to compare it to the big chains such as Olive Garden and Carrabbas  this place beats them hands down every time.  Better decor  better menu selections  and huge portions of food!  You cant always please everyone.  For me  this is a great place to eat dinner or entertain clients.  Huge good portions of food and the best part is the prices.  Cheap prices for decent food in downtown Philly!  I'm not sure why people that dislike chain restaurants write bad reviews about them?   I don't really like them either  but i give credit where credit is due.  This is a good place.\n",
      "This place is an exact three stars. The food is good  not great  and the service isn't bad  but not as fast and attentive as it could be. This place has a lot of seating and a large menu with something for everyone. With so many cozy little byob's in town with much better food   I'd say skip Maggiano's and check one of them out instead.\n",
      "What happened to Maggiano's??? Was given a gift card and was excited for a night out. Service was awful  food was really bad. Only high point was the bread. Was hoping for better. Glad the gift card is at $0.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got a great table on a busy night. I ordered the filet and mashed potatoes. Both were cooked perfectly and was exactly what I was craving. Friendly  attentive service. Great atmosphere. Easily walkable from many of the hotels in City Center. I'm impressed!\n",
      "Excellent Italian restaurant with lots of seating.  Service was excellent  but the food came out so fast (like in 5 minutes!)  it was almost too fast.  In fact  the server forgot to bring the salad to my colleague.  That said  I ordered the half plate  per the servers recommendation  and it was still huge.    Pros:  Excellent food  nice atmosphere  not too noisy  friendly service. Cons: Food came out almost too fast  especially if you are wanting to socialize a bit. Forgot salad  but didn't charge for it.\n",
      "I hate to do this. I really do. But I can't sweep my last experiences under the rug  and chalk it up to \\bad day\\\". Last week  my husband and I drove by and he asked if I wanted to go in for dinner  and for the first time ever   I said no.  One busy Saturday afternoon  my husband and I were absolutely starving  and all that could satisfy my hunger was a burger. Off to MT we went! We walked in and were pushed out of the dining room back into the bar by a surly man who told us to wait for a table. Ok  no problem  we can handle that  we just weren't sure where to go  since no one made an attempt to help us with a table  and we know you can't seat yourself. We have been here before  we know the drill. So we waited  and then were sat  and our waitress comes over about 10 minutes later  we knew everything we wanted: 2 beers  fried greenbeans app (we were curious about this one  since we haven't tried it before)  a burger for me (ordered medium rare)  and my husband got the port richmond platter. Our greenbeans never arrived  but our meals did. I was really disappointed that she forgot the beans  I really wanted to try them. But I brushed it off and moved on. We actually didn't bother to mention it to her  we didn't want her to feel bad. We decided to wait for the bill  and if it was on there  we would just ask her to take it off. Anyways  since I cannot stand a well done burger  I always check before taking a bite to make sure it is cooked properly. I cut into the burger and it was so well done that the meat was crumbling out of the bun. I called the waitress over and showed it to her and asked for another one. She agreed that it was well done  and said she would bring me a new one. 20 minutes later  my husband is finished his meal  our beers have been empty and at the edge of the table in hopes to be re-filled  and I still have no burger. The waitress comes over and asks \\\"how is everything over here?\\\" and I just looked back and said \\\"still waiting\\\". It took her a second  but she realized and ran back to the kitchen  but didn't return with food for another 5 minutes or so. My burger finally came out  and it was less cooked this time  still not med-rare  but edible as it was. So I decided to eat it. We didn't feel like doing another beer at this point so I asked for a water  and my husband got a soda. Now  when i was a bartender  a general rule of thumb was that when someone had been drinking beers  then ordered a soda  it was on the house. But the soda still ended up on the bill  along with the burger  but the greenbeans were absent. She came back over to pick up the bill and said \\\"oh  i don't know why i put that soda on there  i will take that off\\\" (we didn't promt her  she offered that up willingly). But still  shouldn't the burger have come off to? But alas  this had not been the first time my food was cooked improperly at MT  and it will not be the last.  In addition to this experience  my husband frequents this bar after work and on one occasion he came in and ordered the hanger steak medium. It came out rare. Long story short  he had to send it back twice  and it kept coming back rare. He finally told the bartender to just take that steak back and throw it on the grill  don't cook a new one. But they just couldn't get it right.  I really hate to see a good place go bad. But I feel like each time i go back  it gets worse. MT really needs to update their menu a little too  not a lot on her thrills me anymore and there are never any changes or specials. Also  why is there never any PBC beers on tap? The brewery is one minute away  why can't they have it on tap? I am looking forward to the hot dog cart this summer  though. Gourmet hot dogs and good beers. I will still frequent MT for this  but dinner in the dining room is going to be out for a little while.\"\n",
      "Memphis Taproom has delicious beer offerings  tasty food (the best wings in the city  hands down!)  a comfortable neighborhood-friendly atmosphere  two of my favorite bartenders around (Jess and Julianna--those ladies are the shit!)  and a sweet location (three blocks from my house which makes it easier to stumble home after consuming too many beverages).  This is the kind of place in which I can spend all day  11AM to 8PM (or later!)  from Bloody Marias (hey  I like tequila) and eggs at brunch to wings  steak and beer at dinner. Oh  wait! I've done that.  Seriously  the MT rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "We LOVE Memphis Taproom and can't say enough good things about it. It's our go to spot  and for good reason! They have an amazing beer selection along with the best Bloody Mary I've ever had. Their menu is wonderful and caters to all needs. I'm vegan  and it's a great place to go with my non vegan friends and family! Everyone is always happy. Their coconut club is to die for... I should keep track of how many times I've ordered it  but I'm thinking it's up around 20+ now. :)\n",
      "Consider this the six-day review..... for being open less than a week  Memphis Tap Room hit everything just the way the beerflies like it.    The place was mad busy  Flyers on the TV in the bar keeping everyone riled up and yelling... we snagged the last table in the smallish dining room for four of us.    All drafts are $4  which is a great deal.  I got a Poperings Hommelbier  a very hoppy Belgian  in the correct tulip-shaped glass.   Our server also recommended Cooper's Sparkling Ale  from Australia  which was super light but very flavorful.    The food selection was great  we couldn't decide what to get so we got everything!   Wings- superlative  Port Richmond platter of kielbasa  pierogies and potato pancakes- delish  goat cheese salad with smoked walnuts- pretty good  but the smoked walnuts are weeeird.  Kind of like eating a tiny charcoal briquette.  Service was good even though they were slammed.  Definitely will return here to eat many times.   Good work dudes.\n",
      "This review is long overdue! I went here on Valentine's Day 2 years ago to have brunch with a friend. It was great! A woman who is normally a waitress was filling in for the bartender and she was wonderful! She kept us laughing the whole time and she was very personable. She was generous with the amount of alcohol going into a Vodka and Cranberry. The waiter who brought the food out to the bar was very polite. The food was excellent! The deep fried pickles are amazing! They have a lot of unique things on the menu. While this place might be located in New Kensington it is very classy without being too stuffy. The prices are reasonable. There is a very mixed crowed and the beer selection is amazing. I was very impressed at how well it is run  especially on a crowded Sunday holiday. We were never rushed to leave and the wait staff bartenders seem to want you to come back. I felt extremely welcome here and want to compliment the owner and staff greatly! This is the nicest River Ward Bar Restaurant in the area.\n",
      "Came here to try a vegetarian friendly restaurant for me with my meat-eater boyfriend. I ordered the tofu club and he got the chicken sandwich. The tofu club was divine and the fries were equally as satisfying. I've never had a vegetarian sandwich that tasted so good! My boyfriend also enjoyed his chicken sandwich. It's hard to find a place where we can both get something we both really like  so I was really pleased. We will definitely be returning.\n",
      "The Memphis Taproom is definitely a find for any beer lover. The first beer I had  was a Tired Hands + Memphis Taproom Collaboration Conciousness Streams IPA. This was a delicious blend of a fragrant  floral Saison with a just wonderful hit of hops at the end. Not overly hoppy or bitter as IPAs can be. It was a GREAT beer. The second beer  the St. Benjamin Liaison Saison  was a local brew that was a bit darker than a typical Saison  and not quite as flavorful  but still solid. The place is tiny  but attractive. Unfortunately  the outdoor beer garden was closed as it was a Wednesday night. For food  I had the Spaghetti Sandwich  a unique combo of Lentil Meatballs and Spaghetti on a nicely toasted grinder roll. I'd recommend it. The fries were also excellent  crispy and tasty. A slight drawback  if only for the inconvenience  is that parking was really difficult  as the bar is nestled among narrow streets with cars jammed tightly next to one another on the streets. Don't let that stop you from making it out to the Memphis Taproom  however  especially if you're a beer lover  like myself. Enjoy!\n",
      "I finally got down here as part of the English Premier League Season 2008 kick-off weekend promotion. This review is long overdue seeing as I requested The Alstrom Bros. add them to BeerAdvocate.com  The place is easy to get to from Exit 25 off I-95. It is in Kensington but straddles the border with Fishtown. Don't let the fact it is in Kenso keep you away. This side of Kenso never was that bad and if you want proof that the place is on the ascent...just look at the rent/mortgages on Realtor.com for the 19125 zip code. The website has directions and maps. Speaking of websites  it is a very detailed site. Whoever runs it does a great job because it is visually pleasing and it is just organized. The drafts and bottles are listed.   The place has 11 taps including 1 handpump that featured Hop Wallop. The Bottle list is on the rightside of the bar  the Draft is to the left. Of course it has a full bar and a solid wine list. no its not Tria but it is beats out the likes of Monk's. Some of the drafts were: Walt Wit  Original Sin Cider  London's Pride  SN Anniversary Ale(but Southern Hemi was just behind it) Sly Fox Pikeland Pils  Ommegang Rare Vos  Stone Smoked Porter  Green Flash Hop Head Red Ale and Sly Fox Saison. Bottles were around 50 - 60 strong..running the gamet from Lionshead Light to Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen (smells like smoked bacon!). The only stinkers for the nonadventurous would be the High Life and Amstel Light. Drafts were all $4.  The service from Jessica was outstanding. Every thing I want out of a server. You can't miss her. She is a ginger and has many tattoos on her arms. Very attentive and knows her beers. She inspected each glass before using them. I mean she was holding them up to the light to ensure they didn't have a speck of hardwater stain! Plus she picked only good music off the bar's iPod. I never had to wait for her to ask me if I wanted another drink. She found time to chat. She even poured me an ounce of the aforementioned Rachbier from the wee bit that was lingering in an opened bottle. I think she knew the other punter rather well so it wasn't like she was just stiffing him on the last ounce.  The cost was descent. I got thre at 11:00 AM and didn't leave until 2:30. My Girlfriend and I ate and drank our faces off and the bill only came to $69.55! That's less than $20 an hour for pure utopia ($19.87 to be exact). Too bad my Manchester City (not UNITED!!!) club blew the match or else it would have been a perfect day.  Ohand the brunch menu rocked. It doesn't hurt to have a genuine Chef in your kitchen. What other Philly bar do you know that features Polish & Welsh cooking? My beef & onion pasties were great. Nothing frozen here folks. That pastry crust was light and flakey. My Girlfriend's eggs and hash were very good according to her....I have never eaten corned beef hash in my life. The coffee was solid and kept in a carafe as not to render the product ass-like from the heat and oxygen. Hey it was Sudnay at 11 AM and I needed to counter the beer. LOL. Shit even the water must have been filtered because I know Philly tap water's fine aroma all too well. Hey the little things do matter. Oh and the wings were done wel. The oil was peanut and it didn't taste like it was old oil. Plus the scallions were a nice addition as was the real blue cheese that seemed to have an added ingredient (Old bay?)...not sure but it was great. they were not greasy nor were they dripping in a hot sauce. Nice and crisp. Oh and I forgot the wasabi mayo that was under my Pasties was banging! All I know is that Brendan is busting his ass to make this place awesome!!! That neighborhood deserve something this excellent. Kudos to Fishtown native Ken Correll and Nodding Head's Paula Decker for there $$$ in getting this place off to a great start. I have never seen a place get it so right out of the gate. ****BONUS:  there was no PBR to be found on the menu.  Thank God!****\n",
      "Great service  food is \\okay\\\".  I don't think I will return but great esthetics and friendly atmosphere\"\n",
      "I like Royal Tavern  I do  I promise. Good decor  football on the TV  nice bartenders  different and delicious things like truffle oil parmesan popcorn  and a quality jukebox. HOWEVER. I think I'm allergic to this otherwise fine establishment. I walked in tonight - immediate sniffles. Walked out - slight sneezing. And since I've graduated to puffy  watery eyes that can barely see to write this review. I'm willing to give Royal a second chance  but next time I'll be packing some Zyrtex.\n",
      "I actually don't know anyone who has eaten here and does not like the Royal Tavern.  The food is delicious and the portions are generous.  I like to try the specials because I know that whatever I get will be amazing and different  and there are usually at least 5 each day to choose from.  The staff is friendly and really seem to enjoy working there.  Cozy restaurant with a very intimate feel.  I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!\n",
      "I'm not vegan and pride myself on an unapologetic love of meat -- but the vegan sloppy joe may be my favorite item on the menu.  The sloppy joe sauce is out-of-this-world good.  Paired with a beer and some crab fries with a game on the TV at the bar -- it's transcendant.  If you prefer a table experience  there are plenty of seating options away from the TVs at the bar.  The place is rightfully a popular neighborhood hang out  so be prepared to wait to get a seat if you go at a peak evening time.\n",
      "The first time I attempted to dine at the Royal we decided to turn away due to the wait. As I recall it was a Friday after 9pm  so I don't see this as a negative.  I returned for brunch and it was still a bit packed  but they were able to accommodate our odd party of five. We all decided to pass on the hair of the dog so I can't speak for the drinks  but bloody mary's and mimosas both can be had for a reasonable $5. I did go with one of the featured specials of ham  swiss and scrambled eggs in crepes  and I received four of them with some sort of cream sauce on top. I was satisfied with my choice though I did find the lunch meat sliced ham to be a little disappointing.   They have a rather extensive selection of vegetarian/vegan options and the vibe is somewhat hipster  but this is South Philly after all and if you want a cheese steak  well  you know where you can find one. Service was spot on  food was great  prices reasonable. Certainly worth checking out.\n",
      "I came here for the first time  I heard they have great food and drinks.   I went in Christmas Eve to meet my friend their and I was treated with no respect  I don't know if it was because I was gay  black? I don't know.  But the way I was treated by the bartenders was completely inappropriate and my friend who came to meet me even said  he's come before and he feels I might of been targeted because of my race or sexual preference..   I will Never go here again Bc you made me feel like I was a criminal.\n",
      "I am going to have to agree with everyone and say this place is definitely a go. Beer selection is great  service is friendly  and the food is AWESOME! They make the best grilled cheese I have ever had  they use a combination of cheeses  one of which is smoked gouda-and they make it on GARLIC BREAD-you need to try one  today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kind of bizarre that this place advertises itself as the best burger when it features and array of vegetarian and vegan options. I guess it is good that there is something for everyone but I would imagine that if you are a true Vegan  which I am not  that there is not much appeal in watching someone wolf down a burger - - - even if it is the best burger - - or maybe especially because it is purportedly the best burger. So like if a Vegan and a non Vegan come here to eat and the non Vegan is telling the Vegan how good the burger is doesn't that make for an awkward meal?.   I get that these are first world problems but I am just saying. .... I opted for the Wakame Soba salad with tofu. This is not an easy dish to execute and I have to say that they nailed this and got it 100% right! The soba and tofu were cooked perfectly and the vegetable and peanuts in the dish just simply delightful!  If I come back I will try the burger. Hint - - -half priced draft and well drinks at happy hour!\n",
      "Great place.  Surprisingly good food.  Reasonable prices.  Good vibes.  Royal Tavern is one of my go-to places.  It's the perfect blend of relaxed bar and great restaurant.  I have never had anything there that I didn't like.  Highlights include the Angus burger  popcorn  and cubano rolls.  Their brunch is also fantastic!  Breakfast burrito  baby!  The only bummer is that it can get crowded.  The slightly \\relaxed\\\" service doesn't always help that  but in this case  I don't hold it against them.\"\n",
      "BEST Bloody Mary's in the city! Mmmmmm super fresh  savory and spicy  ) Service is meeehhhhh  but they mean well lol. Food is never a miss!\n",
      "Excellent Mexican food.   I would definitely come back.     My wife and I shared 3 dishes and I recommend all of them.   The Queso Fundido Setas was not like the normal nacho looking melted cheese plate that I'm used to.  That's why I normally do not order Queso Fundido.   But the charred corn  pickled onion  and mushrooms sold me.   It came with hot tortillas which I used to make cheese tacos.   This dish would be good for 4-5 people.  Mexican style corn.   It comes with 4 small pieces.  Great size appetizer for 2 people.     Shrimp enchiladas (2 enchiladas).   The only downfall is that it was actually a cheese enchilada with 4 perfectly cooked shrimp on a skewer on top of the enchiladas.  The enchilada was excellent  but we wouldn't have ordered it with the Queso Fundido.\n",
      "We stopped in for late night happy hour. Very reasonable prices. One beer  one michelada  and two tacos for $15. The tacos were really really tasty! If you're out late check this place out!\n",
      "What an amazing place...  Got here a little bit before our reservation and we were seated almost immediately. The server was super nice and very attentive.   The food was outstanding. You have to pay 5$ for chips and salsa  but well worth it.   The wife got the shrimp tacos which being from California and having some killer tacos in the past  there were better than most if not all.  The brisket chilaquiles...holy cow (get it). They were down right the best ones I have ever had and one of the most flavorful and tasted Mexican dishes ever.  If you craving something really good and hearty  go here!   Small so make a reservation.\n",
      "We started with a mango guacamole. The portion seemed a bit small $11 but was still good. I had the roasted beet salad as well. It was pretty plain except for the pistachio purée. My boyfriend and I shared the cholula fried chicken tacos and the grilled hanger steak tacos. Both were a bit spicy but pretty good. The tacos themselves were flimsy and tasteless.   For drinks my boyfriend had the cucumber-jalapeño margarita which was delicious and our friends had the passion fruit margarita which was pretty good as well.  Dessert was AMAZING. Whatever they put in that coconut tres leches cake is unbelievable! You could taste the coconut in the cake  and with the melted marshmallow it was the perfect combination.   The drinks and dessert were my favorites. Maybe next time I'll try something other then tacos and feel differently about the entrees.\n",
      "Hidden gems .. very good food and the dark gothic ambience makes it a fun hangout place .. Only thing that keeps it from getting the perfect 5 star is the fact that it is too small and table almost of top of another. Your date can almost become a double date if there is another couple sitting on the adjoining table . lol . Ofcourse  I went there in winter and I would love to go there again in summer and use the patio to enjoy their great food.\n",
      "This is hands down one of my go-to restaurants. When anyone is in town  I take them here. It's just so good!!  Prices are reasonable  food is tasty  and drinks are always a fun time!   The food is fresh and delicious. Most times I come  I snag the Braised Short Rib nachos. It's listed as an appetizer but there is a LOT of food on that  and it is SO good. The sauce on top is my favorite  and their short rib is cooked so tenderly.  They also always have rotating tacos  which we like to try-- they have all been very good.  Chips and salsa are also a large portion with a variety of chips and different types of salsa- perfect for 2 to share before a meal!   We've also come for their happy hours and late nights - both are excellent deals. Their margaritas are super tasty  and so are their sangrias.  Their pitchers are also at least a good 5 drinks  so they're great to grab when coming as a group! All in all  I can't say enough about how this has been and still is one of my favorite spots in Philly!\n",
      "A fantastic value at happy hour. Dishes like taquitos  albondigas  and tostaditas cost only $5 each. They're decently portioned (not bite sized) and reasonably authentic. You can easily make a meal or a nice group outing out of several of the dishes at once. Drinks are also quite inexpensive at happy hour  ranging from $3-6 for various options.   The regular menu is far spendier  at least on the surface  but the range of options is far more varied  as are the ingredients. Service is engaging and personable  and the vibe is quite lively and social. One of many good options in this neighborhood.\n",

      "Enjoyed a meal here on a weeknight.  The restaurant has a nice ambiance  dimly lit by candles  though the tables are way too close together. This place was formerly a BYOB  but now has a full service bar.  On the plus side  the food was really tasty   especially the fried plantains and the fried chicken tacos.  The blood orange margarita was delicious  if not very strong. For dessert  a pear and basil sorbet was delightfully refreshing and not too sweet.  On the minus side  I just hate when you order small plates and they come out in any random order. Our plantains came our first  then the side of red beans and rice came out 5 minutes before the tacos. Overall the service was somewhat \\meh \\\" our waitress was fairly disinterested  and its one of those places where different people bring your food out and they don't really know who ordered what.  So  some pluses and minuses  but overall a good tasting meal.\"\n",
      "This place is amazing. First time I have tried Turkish coffee and LOVED it here. The veggie wrap and cheese steak is also great. This place gives off great vibes  there is an entire cafe section within the restaurant. I will definitely make sure to come back to this place if I am in West Philly ever again. 5 stars.\n",
      "This place is unique to say the least. The first time we went  we had reservations and still waited 2 hours to be seated. The manager refused to make anyone leave the place  even patrons who had been there 4 or more hours.   Needless to say  whatever they lacked in the seating they made up in the excellent food.   The seven courses are amazing  although i prefer the chicken over the honey lamb. the chicken has a kick to it and is so soft it keeps tearing. I have never has Morocan food more delicious than this.   One bad thing is that it is cash only... which sucks but like i said the food is so great its worth it.\n",
      "I went Saturday night with a small group of friends  and Marrakesh was quite the experience.  I think with a larger group it would just get better!    After finding the restaurant in a back alley and knocking on the door to get in  we were seated promptly in the front room.  Reservations would be a good idea on weekend nights especially.    The food was yummy - not earth shattering perhaps  but definitely a good range and interesting for a fixed course meal.  We chose the spicy chicken and the beef kabobs  and they were probably the best two courses (well besides baklava and mint tea being so awesomely delicious).  We also called ahead and found out that although they now have a full bar  you can still bring in a bottle of wine.  Definitely a good deal - heads up that some of the servers seem rather confused about the policy.  After almost 3 hrs (!) I was full and well entertained - I highly recommend the experience.\n",
      "Absolutely a place to experience.  Tremendous atmosphere  fabulous service  and food that is simply amazing.  Portion sizes are incredible at a price that is exceptional.  You will enjoy every moment!\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to be culture shocked  go to Marrakesh. It feels like a really authentic  cultural experience  supplemented by delicious food. The staff and management have been incredibly courteous and solicitous both times I've attended. If you're squeamish about eating with your hands or having to share food  you'll probably want to skip.\n",
      "Cash only  it's $35 per person 6-item fixed menu plus whatever drinks you want to order. Make sure you come with lots of people  reserve in advanced. The seating really creates a communal atmosphere where you can share off the same plate and chill. What an experience  probably one of the most memorable dining experiences you can get here in Philly. Once you're seated  you get your hands washed with rose water while you're surrounded by dim light and cushy blankets. Then  the food rolls out  and man is it good. I've never had chicken this succulent in my life  it literally fell off the bone. Another highlight was the mint tea during dessert  wow. Awesome spot  will be back for another special occasion.\n",
      "One of my favorites to take out of town guests to  or for any special occasion. Intimate setting that it great for conversation and the food is exceptional. Friendly  family-oriented restaurant that you can tell has stood the test of time for a reason. This place is an experience! Be sure to wear stretchy pants because you will be FULL when you leave. :)\n",
      "FAN-TAS-TIC. From the ambiance to the staff to the FOOD  the experience was definitely worthwhile.  Our waiter was very courteous and we felt very welcomed the instant we stepped into the restaurant. There was about 8 of us which is probably the ideal number (8-10) comfortably sat around a round table.  They started with the hand washing and distribution of towels (yeah we were dressed all nicely which is fine  but keep in mind that your pants might get dirty). The cucumber and eggplant portion (it tasted like beef lol) was delicious  the chicken/egg plate was odd but we liked the flaky stuff as we all choked on the powdered sugar on top haha Then came the meats  we had the mild chicken with olives where  its true  the meat just fell right off the bones  and we had half of the beef kebabs and half of the lamb. The lamb was dry  definitely go with the beef kebabs. The couscous was ok  not really great but it probably would have been better to give that before the meat courses because we were getting stuffed. The desserts were fabulous  incredibly fresh fruit   yummy baklava  and tasty mint tea. The courses were nicely paced and we were finished dinner in a little over 2 hours. All of this for $25 a person! And if you get the wine carafe ($12)  get the white wine.  Now for those of you interested in the belly dancer  our dancer was not that great. She seemed nice but we weren't really into it. However  the other incredibly drunk parties were (luckily we only had to deal with them for a few courses). So gather round some friends  pick a date  and fumble through your way to Marrakesh into the alley and the very dimly lit rooms. You'll like what you find.\n",
      "Review Summary: Ambience: 4/5     Food: 5/5       Service: 4/5   If you're tired of all the fancy Stephen Starr joints around town and need to try something new  Marrakesh is the place to see. Located off South Street  its entrance is a dark maroon door complete with an iron knocker. Please be sure to come with friends  as other reviews have stated Marakkesh's six course meal really packs a punch.   The food was mouthwateringly GOOD. I came here with one other person (rookie mistake) on a quiet Thursday evening  and the waiters were very attentive to us. Everything was delicious without being overly oily. For our first main course we ordered the Spicy Chicken in Cumin Sauce  and for the second Tajine of Lamb. These dishes are meant to be eaten by hand  which we did  but I saw some tables eating with cutlery. Full disclosure  the fruits do come with their labels unpeeled  though I wasn't too worried about that because they were the juiciest  sweetest batch I've had since coming to the States.   We were about to leave when the manager (owner?) emerged from the backroom and told us to stick around to see the belly dancer. I thought this was a really nice gesture  as the dancer had been hired by a large group upstairs and he really did not have to share this information with us.    My one critique  if you can call it that  is directed at Marrakesh's decor. True to its Moroccan roots everything from the furniture to the walls is covered with dark  heavy fabric. Perhaps it is a personal bias  but I found the place to be a little stuffy  and I could not tell how clean everything was. All in all  a MUST TRY!\n",
      "Haters gonna hate! LORENZOS plain slice is bomb.com!!! Slices the size of your head - NOM!! I don't know how you can possibly give this place anything less than 5 stars?!?! Pizza is ALWAYS hot and fresh! Peep the line out the door from open to close! It's even good cold for the morning after a long night of boozing! LOVE this place  a true Philly landmark!\n",
      "I tried a bit of my partner's slice and it was no bueno. I made a face and he said  \\Yeah  you obviously haven't had enough to drink.\\\" Maybe this pizza is good when you're drunk and can't taste anything.  I thought it was strange they don't offer any kind of toppings except one day a week. Maybe I'll hit this spot up again when I am drunk....but probably not.\"\n",
      "Great place for a quick bite of pizza. Prices are rising  though. A slice will be $3.00 starting the month of December.  If you are getting slices  they are only available in plain cheese  no toppings! However  if you order a pie... ask for whatever toppings you like.   Slices are definitely generous  however taste can be inconsistent. Some days  I would get them freshly made and think.. \\damn  this is some bangin pizza!\\\"...and on other days  I would get slices that have been sitting out for a bit and think.. \\\"ehhh... not so great\\\" Either way  I'd lather on the oregano  red pepper flakes  black pepper  cheese and get my grub on.  I would give it four stars  but I have to subtract one due to inconsistency in taste.\"\n",
      "Don't you feel extra hungry after a few alcoholic beverages  like you can demolish 2 cheesesteaks or a whole pizza pie? This is the place to go! Their pizza by the slice is the size of a infant.   Proceed with caution! If the pizza just came out of the oven  the yummy  gooey cheese WILL burn the roof of your mouth. But then you'll bite into a thin  crunchy crust and everything will be ok.  Very good late night eats  if you're in the area. If you're not  catch a cab!\n",
      "Questions:  1) why is it so unusually sweet and greasy?  2) why did i eat this huge slice of a mess?  3) why didn't i just stumble a couple steps more to get steaks at SOS?   Answers:  1) only Lorenzo and son know.  2) so i had a couple drinks earlier that night...  3) see the answer above. +2 more drinks. *shrugs*\n",
      "They're a solid 3. You literally get half a pizza for $3.50. My friends brought me here during happy hour for a slice of pizza and they didn't give me a warning because they wanted me to be in \\shock\\\"  Well  I was. The slice is ridiculously large. You can feed a family of 4 with this thing.  The pizza itself was actually pretty good. Sauce and cheese were good. Crust was nice and crisp. Seems like the perfect place to come in after a few drinks.  I'll be back if I'm in the area again.\"\n",
      "If you want a huge under cooked  greasy oil pit of a pizza that has Chef Boyardee's Spaghetti O's sauce this is your spot.\n",
      "Ninja Turtle pizza!! My friend kept calling it the ninja turtle pizza because the slices were GINORMOUS!!!!  probably the biggest pizza I've had..  We were in Philly for the weekend and worked up an appetite after bar hoping and saw this pizza place.. The line brought us over but the security outside scared us.. Nonetheless  we're only in Philly once  so we decided to wait it through int the long line and ordered a pepperoni pizza to take back to our hotel.. The pizza was pretty good  not sure if I would've enjoyed it sober... they were thin and greasy which perfectly hit the spot  soaking up all the alcohol we just consumed.  Great way to end the night!\n",
      "Do yourself a favor and skip the line at Jim's Steak and head down the street to Lorenzo & Son's! Since we were a large party  we decided to order a whole 28\\ pie! We Loooooved it!! We were the envy of everyone on the street as we walked back to our car. The slices are as large as my cat and the sauce is just as sweet! And don'let a long line scare you away  the service is fast and friendly! There is just no way you will be disappointed!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Went here with my boyfriend and we loved it! Old school feeling  with 3 floors!!  We have been here twice  and each time was great! The food was amazing  I got the veal since it had been recommended to me  as well as the clams casino  mussles  pasta with oil and garlic  and the home-made garlic bread. Staff was nice and helpful!  ...Went here again recently while in the area and had this new dish of gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce in it  and it was delicious!!!!! My new favorite dish as this place.   MUST EAT!!!\n",
      "I have been told by numerous native philadelphians that Ralph's is one of the best Italian restaurants in the city and is a must to experience. We did not think so. We started off with a grilled calamari appetizer that was soaked in salty red sauce. The amount of sauce overwhelmed the palate to the point where we couldn't even taste the calamari. I got the pasta bolognese with filet mignon tips. Again  the red sauce was very salty. The filet mignon tips was really just average quality beef. My wife ordered the black lobster ravioli which were decent but overly salty. We expected much more from the oldest Italian restaurant in the country.\n",
      "This place was phenomenal. The food I must say was some of the best Italian food I've ever eaten. I also unfortunately have a broken cap on my front tooth ( ugh) so I had to order something that was soft and good for a tooth problem. The flavors screamed old world Italian and kids adults were very happy with their meals. I had a pesto sauce on a long thin noodle - cooked to perfection. There was chicken parm at the table and it was not overly fried- very tender and flavorful.  This is A+.\n",
      "Came to visit my daughter and we had dinner tonight.  I had been here before but my husband had not. We were looking at reviews and someone mentioned they loved their Bucatini Ronaldo so I decided to give it a try.  Waiter stated that the pasta for this dish is homemade (like tubed noodles) with shrimp  artichokes and roasted eggplant in a red sauce. While everything was delicious  I thought this dish was fantastic as it was unusual. It had all my favorite ingredients.  Our waiter Kubec was very attentive and service was great.  Overall......5 star worthy!  In fact my daughter is going back next weekend with 6 friends!\n",
      "I was prepared for a tourist trap given the history and reviews  but ended up really liking this place.  We went around 9:30 pm on a Sunday so it wasn't crowded.  The menu is simple and good.  The marinara was flavorful without being sweet.  I like that the mushrooms in the pasta were fresh not canned  as with other old school places in Italian Market.  My friend had an excellent pasta with shrimp and artichokes.  I don't have a need to go to Villa Roma anymore since finding this place.\n",
      "I take out-of-towners to Ralphs to experience authentic South Philly Italian food.   Ralph's never disappoints.  It may not be fancy  but it's classic and damn good.  They are best known for their veal specials  but make a pretty mean chicken  or eggplant parmesan  too.  Other good choices are the antipasto  gnocchi  mussels  and Italian sausage.   But folks are right  the spaghetti is just OK.  Make reservations  and don't forget to bring your patience (it can get loud and crowded)  cash  and plenty of friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was my 30th birthday  and Ralph's food was all that was on my mind.  I was thinking about veal since I knew that Italians really do make it best.  My husband and I stopped in to make a reservation for later that night and the host was very friendly and said \\We don't have anything open until 8:30pm\\\" but that was no problem for us and we just strolled around the surrounding area and stopped in a few shops while we were waiting.  At 8:15 we came back and our table was ready.  We sat down and were promptly served a nice cool glass of ice water.  My husband ordered an Italian Kiss which is some sort of espresso mixed drink.  He said it was out of this world.  A few minutes later we were served some delicious Italian bread and butter.  The bread was wonderful.  We then placed our order after looking over the menu.   We got the escargot as our appetizer.  This was absolutely wonderful!   My husband knew he wanted the Seafood Pescatore.  I decided to have the Veal Marsala and a side of meatballs.  We enjoyed our bread until our meals were brought out.  Now my Veal Marsala was hands down the best dinner out I have EVER had.  The veal was tender  the mushrooms were delicious  and the sauce   well I think I had dreams about it that night.  My husband's dinner was also wonderful.  He used to prepare this himself and was surprised at how fresh and tender the mussels were .  He said he would get that again.  Now the meatballs are something you HAVE to get if you go to Ralph's!!!  These were nice and firm and the gravy was wonderful!  After all this good food we had to finish off the night with a cannoli.  My husband and I both ordered one and got one to go for my Dad.  Well those were crisp and the filling was the best i've ever had!    We will be returning to try more of their food.  Thank you Ralph's for making my 30th birthday incredible!\"\n",
      "I LOVE RALPHS..  My now Ex Husband \\Lenny\\\" used to bring me here all the time.. The food is scrumptious.. The mussels red or white are to die for.Food is always fresh and prepared to order. The Owners 'Jimmy and Eddie\\\"  super nice  very accomodating and made me feel like family... Ronnie too!! I always left here in a food coma... Highly reccommend this wonderful Restuarant.. Gets very busy especially on weekends....Always a great dining experience!!\"\n",
      "Never a bad meal at Ralph's. I wish they had a larger selection of less expensive wine  but I'm going for the food  not the beverages. The pasta is cooked to perfection and even when it's SWARMING with people  the service is stupendous.\n",
      "Finally stopped in the place I have been meaning to get to. I was not disappointed. I had the Giardino. Roasted Eggplant  Peppers  Onions  Pesto  Fennel and Fresh Mozzarella all toasted under a flame for a minute to finish. Great flavors. Good roll. Definitely will return. I saw quite a few people order the Brisket while at the counter. Will try that next time.\n",
      "Today I ordered the Paesano's sub and two friends ordered the eggplant and diavlo. Everything was delicious  the service was quick  and they have gluten-free options available. It's clear that all of the menu items and thoughtfully and lovingly crafted. The complexity of the toppings is refreshing and the flavor combinations are a delight.  I appreciated the cadence of the guys behind the counter  but I observed that their joshing with customers was often unnecessarily aggressive. If you want the experience of attempting to one-up a resigned  portly \\man's man \\\" for the duration of your meal  by all means do not order your sub to go...\"\n",
      "My god these sandwiches are good. I am always down with a greasy spoon  hole in the wall place that makes incredible food. I've eaten about half their menu and everything has been delicious. Bobby Flay lost in the throwdown  enough said. If you're new to the place maybe start with the paesano and call ahead for takeout orders or be ready to wait 10+ minutes for your sandwich to be prepared.\n",
      "If I could go anywhere for a sandwich  and I mean ANYWHERE  it would definitely be Paesano's! It's a little hole in the wall with a very small counter so don't plan on eating there. Go and pick up a unique  delicious slice of Philadelphia and head on your way. I love the Giardina  all vegetarian and it's even better the second day. I hear the Daddywad is also a good call. Try it  no regrets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great sandwiches.  So far I have had the Tuscan Tony  the Arista and by far my favorite  the Paesano.   FYI  the sandwiches are about $8 each but are large can be shared.\n",
      "I've picked up Paesano's three times now  and each time it gets more crowded. The sandwiches are some of the best and most creative I've ever had. We've tried most of them  including the Arista (suckling pig)  Gustaio (lamb) and Paesano (roast beef). Plus a special chicken on they had once. Overall  the Gustaio is my probably my favorite  followed by the Arista and the Paesano. The chicken was actually the only thing I haven't liked so far.   The other great thing is drinks are included in the price of the sandwich - a nice touch. And the folks who work at this tiny place are super-friendly. I'll be going back next weekend  in all likelihood  and recommend you go too!\n",
      "I usually hate brisket and pork sandwiches.  I also normally don't like spicy things and peppers.  That being said both the Paesano and the Arista were over the top awesomely amazing.  Such a balanced  juicy sandwich!\n",
      "Definitely in the top 5 sandwiches I've had  and not just in Philly.  The brisket is so juicy  mixed with the horseradish mayo  pepperocini slices  fried egg  roasted tomatoes - just perfect. The hoagie was superb.  Prices are great  and they have bottles of Hank's soda  too.   The place is small  so not much table space to eat at  but they have tables outside  which made for a lovely lunch. We will be back!\n",
      "Talk about a hidden gem!  I've lived two blocks away from here for six months and finally stopped in for a sandwich.  It's very unassuming from the outside  but I think that's the point.  Continuing with that theme  you only need about five seconds to take it all in.  Tables?  What tables?  There's one counter that seats seven.  Who cares?  It makes it feel exclusive  even \\neighborhoody.\\\"  For the most part the menu is all sandwiches and they know how to make a great one.  With the name of Paesano's you need a great bread for it all and it's the best kind to go with-- seeded.  I tried two of their sandwiches and the most difficult part was deciding which I liked more.    The first I had was the Arista  which was whole roasted suckling pig with broccoli rabe  long hots  and sharp provolone.  You can't get any more Philly with this sandwich.  I left off the rabe  but didn't notice anything lacking.  It was amazing with the pork being tender and very juicy.  My only minor complaint was I felt it could have had a little more meat on it.    The second sandwich was the Paesano.  I'm assuming it's their signature sandwich being the restaurant's namesake.  The Paesano has a lot going on.  It's a brisket sandwich with horseradish mayo  roasted tomatoes  peperoncino  and sharp provolone.  Oh  I almost forgot the fried egg!  The egg makes it unique and finishes off an already awesome sandwich with an even better taste.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Overrated. This place is ok  often the crust is burned...maybe our pallets aren't sophisticated enough to appreciate that taste but it's not our thing. We enjoyed the cauliflower salad and the fried dough ball dessert is delish\n",
      "\n",
      "Philadelphia  I love you.  Places like this remind me why.  We sat at the counter and watched the guys make the pizzas.  Our son hates cheese on a pizza and they had one already on the menu for him: The Marinara (oregano  crushed san marzano tomatoes  garlic  olive oil).  It was simple... but delicious. If you like real wood-fired pizzas that char the crust (a little blackened... in a good way)  this is the place to go to.  Our other favorite pizza joints that rival this place are Lombardi's (NYC) and Grimaldi's (Brooklyn).  We all had a slice and were shocked at the lovely simplicity of it. Razor thin slices of garlic dotted the fresh tomato sauce.  My husband and I shared the Salsiccia (fennel sausage  roasted fennel  tomato sauce  mozzarella).  Roasted fennel on a pizza?  Brilliant. I cried a little.  No wait... I REALLY cried when we shared this cocktail: The Brooklyn (Dad's Hat rye  Luxardo cherry  white vermouth).  It says it serves one  but they brought it out in a cute little bottle and gave us each a glass...each with a hand- crafted giant square ice cube (hipster-cool) and Luxardo cherries.  Perfection.  We also shared a Rotolo (pizza dough  mortadella  ricotta  pistacchio pesto).  Those are crazy amazing.  I kept saying my husband could eat the rest... then freaking out and going back for another bite. He's lucky I didn't stab him in the hand with a fork to fight over the last bite (to be fair  he was the smart one who ordered it).  I could've eaten several of those and forgotten the pizza (although that was wonderful too!).  We finished with a little dessert... perfect little Italian cookies (\\Cookie Jar\\\" - pignoli  almond cookies  chocolate biscotti  pistacchio gnocchi) and I got an Affogato (fiordilatte soft serve with a shot of espresso).  The soft serve is Italian sweet cream... decadent and lovely... with rich espresso in a pretty little Italian mug.  I'm in Heaven here.  I know nothing about Vetri's other restaurants  but I'm checking them out next time I'm in Philadelphia!  By the way... service was great and friendly.  5 stars all around!\"\n",
      "I really enjoyed this hip pizza shop. The atmosphere was great. Hip hop was jamming in the background so we at the community tables could have great conversation. The wait staff was very knowledgeable and just wanted to customer to have a fabulous experience. Local beer  wine on tap  and delicious pizza. We ordered the prosciutto pie and Nutella dessert pie! Yum\n",
      "Oh Pizzeria Vetri  how I wanted to 4 and 5 star love you- but our night wasnt that night. Don't get me wrong  your food was decent- the Crudo was tasty and the rotolo was great but I guess the hype prior to meeting you was just a bit oversold.   Service: Meh. everyone there seemed really bored and the vibe was a bit bland.   Seating: I sat at the counter because I dislike communal seating unless I'm at a bar. I recommend this option if you don't want to sit near someone else's hangry toddler or if you just want to watch the pizza making magic.  Food: Decent. The pizza (I got the Crudo) was good and rotolo was really good but my pizza was a bit too oily and was barely warm. Other then that  the thin crust style pizza was well executed and all of the ingredients were fresh. The prosciutto wasn't overly salty and the sauce was lovely.  I will probably go back soon to try a bit more from the menu since there were a lot of things that were appealing like the Melanzana and Salsiccia pizzas or the Nutella Pizza for dessert  yum.    To be continued...\n",
      "We really enjoyed our visit to Pizzeria Vetri.  The group split four pies  Margherita  Crudo  Quattro Formaggi and Renato.  They all tasted great  I think the Margherita and Crudo were our two favorites.  Good beer selection and the Fried Pizza Dough dessert was a nice ending to fun night out.    PV is quite small with little waiting space  the bar Kite & Key across the street is a good spot to wait and have a drink.\n",
      "Checked this spot out with work colleagues due to its convenient location to our work (we could walk & leave cars in parking garage!).  Pleasantly blown away!  Sicilian slice with pancetta & vidalia onions was unbelievably airy & done perfectly.  Shared an Italian Caesar salad -- little heavy on dressing but loved the anchovies!  Splurged & got the sweet cream & cappuccino soft serve twist -- we all devoured this in minutes! Dining partners loved the assortment of Italian cookies (I was in gluten coma & could not do any more dough!  Fell off my GF wagon for the night).   Would so come back again!  Get here early ... We did thankfully  was packed by 6p.\n",
      "This is a decent pizza place with a pizza bar around the pizza oven hearth where you can see them make pizza right in front of you.  The service is pretty quick. The only downside is that it is a small place and is always crowded so you should expect wait times.\n",
      "\n",
      "we walked here for dinner last night. very good. we sat at the bar and began to taste. i tried the carnitas and pollo tacos  which were just delicious and so very fresh tasting. g went with the nachos. i stole a couple of chips from the plate which were fine as well.  for drinks i went with the margarita and the regal  g went with 6point ales. the crowd was mixed and the music was good. this is a cash only spot but i understand there is atm on premises. the bartender was friendly and attentive. a good time type of place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Loco pez easily has the best array of tacos I have come across yet in Philadelphia. They offer dollar tacos once a week (which they change up  announcing when it occurs that day which helps to fray the taco traffic a little). However  when it is dollar taco day  be forewarned that there will be a wait probably upwards of an hour. Trying to go there during happy hour is impossible unless you are there at the start of it. I have found the best times to go for the dollar taco night is going later in the night. The nice thing is that they are located across the street from a bar  which has a good draft list at very reasonable prices  that you can go sit and drink at while you wait.  My favorite tacos include the chorizo&potato  the carne asada  and the shrimp (tempura?). They also serve their food with a bunch of different hot sauces which are made in house and quite delicious.\n",
      "Love this place. First off it has a cool laid back environment  much like you would expect from a Fishtown restaurant. The variety of meats for the tacos is great. I recommend the shrimp tacos and the pork taco- also can't go wrong with the Kenzo Nachos. It's a fun spot with good food and drink. You definitely won't want to go to Taco Bell after eating here.\n",
      "We've gone three weeks in a row for dinner and have not been disappointed at all. Their margaritas are tasty and strong (rare combination) and their food is great and cheap! We did have to wait a while each time for a table  but we waited at the bar and enjoyed some drinks which passed the time quickly. The homemade hot sauces are a nice touch. The green one is especially spicy and great on their chips. The tacos themselves are small but there is plenty of meat and tons of flavor. Everyone is nice and they work to get you a table as fast as they can. It is cash only  but there's an ATM in the restaurant for those that don't plan ahead. This is a great new neighborhood spot.\n",

      "This place is amazing. Only thing I don't like is the area is a lil sketch. Im from california and I know good mexican. Trust me! Loved the three tacos I tried today. Will def be back  esp on their dollar taco nights!\n",
      "Loco Pez is a pretty cool vibe  a little hipster for me  but hey  I live in Fishtown. This food is really good and staff is friendly. A downfall is that it get really crowded  but only on Friday night and weekends usually.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this place SO MUCH  I drive several miles out of my way when going to New Jersey just to get a veggie combo Manakeesh. The z'atar is so fresh and makes the Manakeesh extra yummy. I also have gotten a few different smoothies from here as well  made fresh and absolutely delicious! You won't be disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been coming here for a couple of years now. It is my absolute favorite cafe in all of the city. It is inexpensive. You can come here just for the freshest dessert and a sharing pot of traditional mint tea (GOOD crepes  waffles and fruit  mamoul  baklava  smoothies) or for a complete meal (rice  meat  pita  salad  the most delicious hummus ever  and more)  There also make espresso drinks. One of the rare places that do a lot and still do it well.  The ambiance is relaxing and cozy. It is well decorated  tasteful  but casual. No matter when I go  it is always bustling with mixed clientele from all backgrounds.  It dies down for a moment during prayer time at the mosque down the road. There is also outdoor seating for when Winter finally gives up on harassing us. It's a great place to hang out for hours and no one will judge you if you break out a deck of cards (n case anyone was wondering). There is also free wifi.  It is a very successful business  and I hope it stays around for good!\n",

      "The falafel sandwich was tasty but was not stuffed properly and was too bready. The fries were cold  underdone  soggy  and worst of all  contained bits of chicken in them (I'm vegan). My friend ordered a Shish taouq platter and the staff required a reminder to make her side of freshly baked pita  which was probably the best part of our meal.  There was a polite employee who looked new who told us to take our time as we glossed over the menu. His coworker Manager looked at him and snidely said \\don't tell them that  we close in one hour\\\" while we were still standing there. That some pretty ironic customer service training  lol. This place has excellent reviews  and perhaps on a good day this place can be excellent  but my experience tonight was subpar from all ends.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been here twice for take out. Both times they messed up my order. The first time I let it slide. The second time I asked for a refund. They refused. So  I did a chargeback. Caveat emptor: if you order food here  and they mess it up  they do not want to accept responsibility.\n",
      "Manakeesh is just a beautiful space to sit  have a great conversation  drink their excellent Turkish coffee  and indulge in their really great home-made sweets.  The food and drink are four stars  but it's the bright  airy space and the really lush decor that make this place five stars for me.  I miss living in the neighborhood!\n",
      "Worth the price  as always. Their vegetarian options are just as good as their meat options  and although it gets busy  splitting a platter with a friend can be a fun dinner experience. I ordered pick up for the falafel platter for a friend and he enjoyed every bite. They hand make their bread right in front of you so you know that when you eat it  dipped in hummus or whatever you get  it will be light and delicious. The bakery on the side has its own name  but their smoothies are fresh too  and they have super authentic baklava  mamool  and other treats. Also great crepes.\n",
      "I absolutely love this place.  The food is light and filling.  I was hesitant because I had never ordered anything like this before but  I found myself craving it.\n",
      "I can't believe I haven't written a review before. This place is just terrific  and one of the main reasons I miss living around the corner from here.  Everything I've ever tried here has been spot-on  from the eggs benedict over smoked salmon with potato latkes  to the baked goods  or the baked eggs with sausage.  Excellent brunch.  The only downside (aside from the wait  if you show up after 10:30) is the fact that they could use one more staff person up front - one to take the names of the people waiting in line  and another to take the money of the people trying to pay and leave.  But food-wise  solid and amazing.\n",
      "Made an appearance in this place on Easter Sunday '18. Bc I literally am incapable of getting my shit together to go to brunch at a reasonable hour  the 2:30 closing time has been prohibitive in the past. On this particular day despite all of the shit I had to do  I said \\fuck it\\\" and managed to squeeze myself and my dining partner into a table at this joint at like 2pm.   So basically long story short  I'm gross and basic and doing the keto diet now. After some serious indiscretions on the day prior  I needed to propel myself back on the bandwagon ASAP. Luckily reconciling both low carb and vegetarian there were a bunch of egg options. The omelette with sun-dried tomatoes  goat cheese  and spinach was my go-to. Dining partner ordered this like eggs benedict with  and I suggest sitting down rn  POTATO LATKES INSTEAD OF ENGLISH MUFFIN! Probably in honor of passover. Holy shit what a fucking concept.   Omelette was good and enjoyable. Not the best thing of my life. Not something where I would go out of my way to recommend or return for but satisfying. Those potatoes looked heavenly and I just had to sample one little baby tater cube which tasted as good if not better than its appearance. According to dining partner  the eggs benedict was amazing.   Believe it or not I did not consume any alcohol during this meal. Main reason for that being this place doesn't have alcohol. Service was good too/people were nice and all that good shit.\"\n",
      "THAT STUFFED FRENCH TOAST THO.  One of my fears with starting my day with French Toast is the inevitable food coma that topples me over for the rest of the day.  Not the case with this beautiful dish. The amount is perfect to split with a friend date so it's not overwhelming.   Waiter was very nice about letting us switch over to nice window seating after we ordered.  Just an overall friendly place to be with exceptional brunch!\n",
      "Love going to brunch here!  Perfect location and I like the \\family\\\" atmosphere  not stuffy or pretentious.  The baked goods are delicious and my favorite thing to order is the potato pancakes benedict  AMAZING.  They also do take-out  which I have ordered and to treat myself to brunch in bed :)  Only downside is that during the busier hours there can be a long wait.  But that's only a sign of how good this place is.\"\n",
      "I saw people were waiting outside of the restaurant all the time. This place must be good I thought. Maybe I picked the wrong dish. I enjoyed my stuffed challah French toast but I wouldn't wait more than 10 min to eat it again. That was right after my mind blowing experience at Sabrina cafe's stuffed french toast so Day by Day one didn't do much for me....   My parter of scavenger hunt got burger. He enjoyed and finished all but hasn't asked me go back there yet so I guess it is solid 3 star place.\n",
      "Probably one of my favorite brunch places in Philly. This one gets five stars because the food is really high quality and there isn't such a huge wait like at Green Eggs. They also give a lot of food haha. I recommend coming here on saturday at 9:30am - right when it opens. It's quiet  and you're guaranteed to get seats. Got the sweet potato chorizo hash and it's sweet and spicy! Loved it.\n",
      "My friend Andy and his boyfriend were in town for a wedding and they suggested we go to Day to Day  because it was close to the hotel where they were staying.  The place was very busy but it was only a short wait until we were able to be seated.  The waitress came and got our drink orders quite quickly but then we said we needed another minute.  She came back and we still weren't ready so she said she would come back but then it was a really long time before she finally came back to take our orders.  All of the food options looked like good quality  although there was only a handful of items that I personally was interested in.  A lot of stuff seemed to unnecessarily include bacon  which I don't like.  The menu was also quite confusing.  The menu listed on yelp  on their website  and in the restaurant were all very different.  Online there was a \\lunch menu\\\" which included a burger  which is what I wanted to order.  Despite it being 1pm when we went there  there was no \\\"lunch\\\" menu offered so I couldn't get the burger.  I ended up getting huevos rancheros and potato pancakes  both of which I split with my girlfriend.  The potato pancakes ($9) were really delicious  although you only got three small pancakes.  I would have expected more for the price.  The huevos rancheros ($11) were so-so.  I enjoyed them but I've had much better.  It certainly wasn't worth the price.  So in all I had an okay experience but probably wouldn't go back again because the prices are just too high compared to how much I enjoyed the food.\"\n",
      "Had to knock a star off after a handful of trips to this place  it's just not a five star restaurant.  The food is good  and menu varied  but there are little things that are starting to bother me:   - nasty stains inside the coffee mugs  - the low quality plastic table cloths  - the lack of crab in my girlfriend's crab omelette  - the way my burger was about 70% of the size of the bun  leaving way too much room for toppings to slide all over the place.  I'll keep coming back but I think a lack of competition keeps this place from being a real dynamite brunch spot.\n",
      "Day by Day is a good brunch option that is a little removed from the craziness of bustle of Rittenhouse  but there is plenty of bustle within this restaurant  partly driven by the patrons waiting around for a table due to the no-reservations policy. On my first visit  we loved the Potato Pancakes Benedict and one of the many daily specials  blintzes. More recently  we tried more lunch-y items  including the BLT and the Pulled Pork special  which were a little lackluster. I'll be back  but will stick to the breakfast menu.\n",
      "Came here for lunch on a weekday...which was probably a mistake as all the reviews and amazing pics were of brunch items. I got the Oven Fried Chicken Salad with Buttermilk dressing  the sis also got a salad with tuna and minestrone soup  both salads were just underwhelming. My salad was basically romaine topped with what tasted like prepackaged Applegate chicken strips and honey mustard dressing.  Stick to brunch options on weekends and can't recommend their salads.\n",
      "Been here twice and both were a great experience. Food was great. Pork belly Reuben  Brussels sprouts  and more.\n",
      "This is a wonderful restaurant with stellar service. If you're looking for a true dining experience  look no further. The food is executed so well and the wine list is refreshing. I've dined here a number of times and everything was consistent. The staff is also hot AF.\n",
      "We had very high expectations since we love Zahav.  Abe Fisher exceeded those expectations and we were \\WOW\\\"ed by the experience.  As different as it is from Zahav  it is equally impressive.  Though everything was amazing  the brussel sprouts  chopped liver  pork belly  gefilte fish and veal tacos were most memorable. Cocktails  wine  dessert  and service were outstanding as well.  We were fortunate to grab the only two seats at the chefs table.  We look forward to going back and trying the smoked short ribs  which looked succulent and delicious.\"\n",
      "I've been trying to muster up the words to describe our awesome experience at Abe Fisher  but all you really need to know is that you need veal schnitzel tacos in your life immediately.  The chef's skill at balancing flavors is on full display in every dish  and my only regret is not having the stomach capacity to try everything on the menu.  $39 a person lets each person at your table choose three small plates and a dessert  which was perfect for sharing and trying a huge variety of food. I wouldn't change a single thing about our choices tonight:  Course 1: - Raw and marinated bass: perfect start  could bathe in the avocado cream - Borscht tartare: I don't even like beets and this was phenomenal  Course 2: - Kasha varnishkes: so rich  could've been a dessert or a meal and I wouldn't have thought twice - Sweet and sour meatballs: I would put this sauce on everything  Course 3: - Lamb leg: my fiancée is still blown away by the amount of flavor packed into the lamb - Veal schnitzel tacos: unanimous choice for favorite dish of the night  just get it  Dessert: - Bacon and egg cream: this sets the bar dangerously high for bacon in desserts - Almond panna cotta: my fiancée was disappointed she couldn't get the apple strudel (tree nut allergy) until this came out and she apologized to the culinary gods for ever doubting this place after the first three courses\n",
      "A fan of what sounded like a really good menu  I wasn't impressed with either the portions or the combinations of plates presented. Perhaps it was too new that even though we tried several dishes as a group  the overall was a weak impression.\n",
      "Great food all around. Great scene. Came in after a long day at work during a business trip in Philly. Sat at the bar and literally was impressed by everything that I ordered off the bar menu. Cocktails we're phenomenal also. All round great place for a nice business dinner  date or happy hour.\n",
      "Food is fantastic. A modern take on traditional Jewish dishes  making them unrecognizable in a good way. The music sucks- like you're in a sports bar and 20 years old. Too loud and totally inappropriate! Who is their music selector! So wrong. There were families with babies  and young children  and older couples. The music should have been just instrumental  lower in volume  and more in line with the ethnicity of the food.\n",
      "My husband and I were happy to try this restaurant last Saturday but the food will not draw us back.   The positives: Friendly wait staff. The shrimp fried rice was good  although the texture of the rice was a little off.  The veal schnitzel tacos were okay (my husband enjoyed them very much)  but I thought the veal was too heavy and I did not enjoy the health salad on top.  We loved the apple strudel.  The negatives: The kasha varnishkes had an odd taste.  The corned pork belly was essentially a fatty pork rind  and I was just not a fan. The blood and smoke cocktail was my least favorite cocktail that I have ever ordered  the ice made it difficult to drink  and the flavor was much too smoky for my liking.    I did not enjoy the restaurant's décor  I felt refreshed upon leaving.\n",
      "PROS: Tasty yet simple dishes  great desserts  fast service CONS: -  The borscht tartare  shaved beets topped with a half-egg and trout roe  and the salmon gravlax  cubed salmon with thinly sliced radishes and chunked potato latke  were simple in flavor but appetizing as starters. The kasha varnishke was a tad salty and dull  reminiscent of Americanized ravioli  but the roasted salmon was perfectly cooked and paired finely with the dill sour cream and swiss chard. For dessert  I enjoyed the almond panna cotta --- the almond flavor reminded me of a thicker  creamer version of Chinese annin tofu/xingren doufu  paired with various small  sliced fruits. The food here is pretty solid overall.\n",
      "Food was amazing  and the best service foh staff we have ever experienced in the Philly area.\n",
      "Ate: Grilled Octopus  Spring greens  Pici  Drank: Scotch cocktail (Rusty Nail)  Aperol  Liked: The biali was really good and the pici was unique and pretty well done.  Disliked: We waited 10 minutes for our table even though we had a reservation  was there on time  and there were larger empty tables that were free (these tables were never used while we were there).  Service was spotty and slow (It took so long to get our drink orders that we had to call for our waiter and we just ordered dinner as well)  We waited so long to order dessert that we just decided to skip it.  Chicken: n/a  Would mom like it?:  No  she wouldn't have enjoyed the spotty service.  Would I go back: No.  The food wasn't that amazing and the service was really disappointing.  Recommend: For the prices they are charging  there seems to be many other options in the city with similar food and better service.\n",
      "Re-visited Fork for my birthday  and I have to say that the quality of the food and experience remains top-notch. The cocktails are fantastic  and sampling each dish (and complementary palette cleansers and creative bread offerings) I have to say that there were no disappointments during this meal ... everything was flavorful and expertly executed. The branzino was once again a home run. Coming back here after taking a mini-tour of different restaurant offerings around Philly  it's clear to me that Fork is one of the few places in town that has the total package: excellent food  drinks  service  and ambiance.\n",
      "Service unfortunately was very poor and not worth coming in the future for  an $80-100 meal (with a few drinks).  Do not recommend for the value or the experience.  Server was very slow  was sat 40 min after the reservation and server was more interested in coming by to upsell than serve. Two of the four items I ordered were too salty and ruined the meal.\n",
      "I love this place. It has a cozy  homey vibe and always an interesting menu. My boyfriend and I were excited to find that they serve chicken livers  which are delicious. I also thoroughly enjoyed the butternut squash soup. It's a great spot for dates or business dinners and is perfect for those who want to try something new or for those who simply enjoy American cooking.\n",
      "Had a corporate dinner at the Fork on Tue evening. We had the crudo which was tasty but too small a portion for an appetizer ( hence the one star deduction). This was followed by the NY Strip steak medium well and boy!! was that delicious  served with some sort of a pesto sauce. This was followed by an apple cake dessert. The ambiance is cozy  it is a very old place as all of the restaurants in Philly would be and we were seated in an inner room served by very well dressed and polite staff. All in all a good meal  will definitely come again.\n",
      "It's the next level of High Street on Market which is the shop next door.  Drinks are pretty strong    I had the chicken which is cooked perfectly and my friend enjoyed her lasagna a lot.  The dessert was just alright tho.   Service also  very pleasant.\n",
      "We revisited Fork with friends. We heard the exec chef had changed. I saw a big change in the menu as well as I couldn't find things that used be on the menu. I thought perhaps this was a good thing since I wasn't impressed at all the first time we were here.  The meal  however  still lacked creativity and the extra flare. The only exception was the gnocchi  which was one of the best  fluffy  light gnocchis I've had. My roast chicken  the skin wasn't crisp. The pork chop tasted a bit oversalted (tasted like it was brined for a bit too long before cooked). The branzino...they really should remove the bones when they serve it (at other places like butter in NYC or raddicchio cafe  they remove the bones).  So overall  I would say  it's still \\Meh\\\" in my book.\"\n",
      "I lived in Germany for 3 years and Belgium for another 3. I know my cooked cabbage. Fork sent me back instantly to some of the best central European meals I've ever had... even better. I've NEVER had cabbage as good as Fork's.  On top of that  my dinner was a trans-formative event. I've never had a meal that literally changed my mood. And I was in a REALLY bad mood. I had just gotten a BS speeding ticket earlier in the day and had been stuck in traffic for hours. Fortunately my girlfriend had made reservations at Fork. With each bite  the wonderful flavors of the thick  tender pork chop  the sweet cabbage and the tangy mustard apples melted away my bad mood.\n",
      "I have been to Fork a few times before and after chef Eli Kulp came on board and though the building is the same  the restaurant is entirely new. It went from an okay option to one of my destination  special occasion restaurants.   I am literally salivating remembering the two meals I have had there this winter/spring.  In both visits  the pastas were huge highlights. Chef Kulp is coming from a Michelin starred Italian restaurant in New York  and it shows. We had the pisatchio agnoletti with rabbit ragu. The filling was pureed pistachios and was bright in flavor and color  topped with a delicate braised rabbit sauce. I dream of that pasta. On my next visit I had the seafood pasta with black and which picchi. The textures and flavors of this dish were so complex  plus it was a work of art to behold. The octopus and veal carpaccio appetizers were also fabulous.   The most extraordinary thing  however  that I ate at Fork was the two-person duck special. Literally  they brought out a whole roast duck for us to see. He was golden and crisp looking. Then they took him back to the kitchen and turned him into 5 different amazing duck dishes  including breast  meatballs (the highlight)  and procuitto salad.   Finally  there are really interesting  not overly sweet  cocktails.   Seriously  I can't tell you how much Fork has improved in my estimation since getting its new chef. It has  in my opinion  become one of the best restaurants in the city.\n",
      "Fork was really fantastic. I ate at the bar and was still amazed by the attentive service. The only way I can describe the food is that if you truly want an experience where your mouth explodes with flavor  this is the place. The chef pushes him herself to create a mouthwatering dish and it really surprised me.  Btw I had no preconceived notion of the food  I was going in for Wine Week and got surprised by the food.\n",
      "Good food  priced fair  service wasn't so great. My silverware was dirty. My breakfast was half cold  although I would probably not come back the food was okay nothing to brag about.\n",
      "We stumbled on this place for Sunday brunch. Staff are of the young  beautiful  and painfully hip variety and made this 27-year-old feel way too ancient and out of it. We were served a complimentary palate cleanser of strawberry agua fresca to start  then I followed up with coffee and a turkey sausage  spinach  and cheddar egg white omelette. The omelette was a good size but not gargantuan like some calorie-bomb omelettes I've known. It was a little sparse on fillings  I would especially have appreciated more spinach as there really wasn't enough to taste. It came with decent homefries and tasty multigrain toast  if I'd been thinking I would have subbed the fries for fruit as I heard another table do. Service was sharp  and when I went to the restroom I realized why there wasn't a ridic wait a la brunch in Houston/Austin: the place is a total rabbit warren  with two additional seating areas.  Decor was faux-vintage diner  I was a fan of the martini-garnish hanging lights (olives on toothpicks). A fun place for a random brunch  but I'm not sure I'd seek it out if I was back in the city.\n",
      "Never would Continental see me walk into one of their restaurants and spend my money there after my experience this past Saturday.   Myself and two friends arrived around 4pm Saturday afternoon.  It was obvious that it was not busy at all as we were promptly seated and it seemed like everyone in there were either eating  had drinks or were wrapping up to go.  As soon as we were seated one of my friends went to the bathroom while the remaining two of us were mulling over the menu.    The staff was busy buzzing around but no one came over to us. My friend returned from the bathroom about ten minutes later and we still had yet to be approached  not even to be offered a glass of water. So we waited some more and started to get annoyed. The couple in the boot next to us had just left and their table was being cleared and cleaned so one of my friends turned around and asked for our waitress/waiter. He said no problem as he walked away for what we assumed to get our waitress.   Another five minutes passed and no one came so we just decided to get up an leave because approximately 20 minutes passed and we got no service. As we were walking out very annoyed and disappointed  a couple was being seated next to the boot that we just left. As we walked by the window outside of the restaurant of course there was a waiter already at their table taking their order.  Just one thing I have to point out is that we were the only group of black people in the restaurant at the time so it is hard not to feel that this experience had nothing to do with the color of our skin.\n",
      "The Continental is cute and fun and great for going with a bunch of friends and ordering everything. The majority of the cocktails are overpriced but are so cute with their Tang rims or their gummi fruit garnishes  but there are some classics on the menu that pack a real punch  - personally I like the Rock and Rye. Some of my favorite foods here are the edamame  the bbq chicken quesadilla  and the salads  but I honestly have fantasies about the cheesesteak eggroll. It is so perfect. I usually have a good experience when I go here  minus some quirky service.\n",
      "Wow!  One word comes to mind when I think of this restaurant...\\totally incompetent\\\".  I really enjoyed the food and the decor is stellar  but c'mon people  how many times can you Eff up the order?  Every person I've talked to that has gone here for dinner or lunch has complained about the idiot teens that swear \\\"this is what you ordered\\\"  and \\\"I dunno I just finished training\\\".  I recommend skip the dining scene and just go to the 3rd floor outdoor bar which is preally fun.  Expensive drinks but they're original and one of the only redeeming qualities of this place.\"\n",
      "This place should actually be 4.3  I LOVE THIS PLACE!  it is in a very good location.  beautiful city scenery and lots of neat space (you'll know what I'm talking about when you get seated in the back of this restaurant.  Food is great!  I get everything and anything here.  I highly recommend their philly cheesesteak rolls burritos?  They are amazing!   And service?  Excellent.  Servers are wonderful and place is happening!\n",
      "This place made some tasty drinks and their string fries were really good.  It kind of has this retro-cosmo-lounge thing going on that almost works but seems like something is missing.  The crowd is OK  but nothing special.  It is kind of a busy area  so I don't feel like there is a large group of regulars or anything.  Service was decent.  *Pretty good drinks *Cheeky Cosmo Lounge\n",
      "Everything here looks good  but when it comes to food we all know that looks come second. What's good about this joint is the retro diner setting paired with the trendy new age vibe in the second room. On a scale of 1-10  the Continental gets a 9 in aesthetics.  The service was pretty good when I went with my group of 8. We sat in the trendy second room. It was not busy  so in all fairness I don't know exactly how well the Continental does in terms of service.  The food was pretty good. I would not label the food as great  but it definitely was not bad. I only award the Continental 3 stars because  while a pretty good restaurant that entertains the eye and satisfies the stomach  it falls in comparison to restaurants that earn 4 or 5 stars.\n",
      "Loved this place! It's adorable  inside and out. Started out with a Gimlet  it was divine. Had the Korean Pork Tacos and they were superb.   Our table shared the shoestring fries which I thought were way too skinny to eat. It was a gigantic portion  enough for 4+ people. Liked that they came with hot mustard.\n",
      "Continental is a nice place to bring your friends and enjoy the atmosphere. The swing chairs were fun. When it comes to food  I only stick to the calamari salad. There were times I wished they were more generous with the dressing though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delicious food  nice atmosphere  good service....A Go!\n",
      "My husband and I came here tonight for restaurant week.  This was our first time at the Capital Grille  and we were NOT disappointed!  We each had a salad  him the Caesar and me the mixed greens with roasted tomatoes  both outstanding.  We both had the 14 oz bone in sirloin.  Amazing!  All the sides were delicious as were our desserts.  Excellent service from our waiter too.  We will definitely be back!\n",
      "Went for valentine's day dinner  had a sharaz bottle of wine from Australia. I gad the lobster bisque all so good  girlfreind had the wedge salad  very good she said. I had the delmonico steak with peppercorn always to die for  cooked perfectly  she had the filet and was cooked to perfecrion. We than had berries and cream for dessert . Service is always so so good  I never had an issue or a bad meal.\n",
      "Great dinner at Capital Grille! We had a fantastic server (Bob I believe?) who was incredibly wonderful the whole night. Very friendly and a joy to have.  We started off with a glass of red wine- which we picked off a very extensive menu on an Ipad- a very cool and interesting way to have their drinks.  We started off with a complimentary little chip with shrimp as a \\starter\\\". We ordered the Filet Mignon and the Porcini Rubbed Bone-In Ribeye. We added sides of brussels sprouts and truffle fries along with our entrees. And they were SO good. The filet mignon was good  a little bit overcooked  but still tasty. The Porcini steak was mind-blowingly good. The sauce complimented everything perfectly  and it was cooked to almost perfection. The brussels sprouts were also tasty - nice and crisp on the outside  but soft and delicious on the inside. The truffle fries- even better. They were unbelievably crisp. Plus  the side entrees were very generous. All of this was more than enough for us two to enjoy. We boxed home half the sides and part of our entree.    Capital Grille is definitely pricey though- we managed this time with a gift card. Will we come back again? Probably not in the near future. Will we wish we could come back again all the time? Most definitely.\"\n",

      "The steak  which is supposed to be the signature  was just mediocre. It was fine but definitely not worth the money. The seared salmon was disappointing. It was too bland. The no bake chocolate espresso cake was pretty good  which is the only reason for the stars. It is way too expensive for the quality they provide.\n",
      "Deeply disappointing. Our waiter Eric was attentive and knowledgeable and the steak  fabulous. Wine selection also very nice  but that's where the positives end. What happened to the class and decorum of this restaurant?? Patrons dining near us with cutoff shorts and Eagles jerseys? Unacceptable. Are they that desperate to fill tables? This used to be a classy restaurant. When returning after theatre for a cocktail  bartenders ignored us until we finally decided to walk over to the hostess to ask if we could get service at a bar table we were sitting at  directly across from the bar. It took forever and finally got a server who was less than pleased to be bothered to do her job. We won't be back. Management should do some major reevaluating of staff  decorum  dress code and attentiveness to clients at this supposedly high end steak house.\n",
      "The Capital Grille is among my top three restaurants of all time. It's definitely the best Steakhouse in Philadelphia  bar none. Everything here is amazing. I challenge anyone to order just one appetizer. The menu practically begs you to overdo it  and I am always more than happy to accommodate. Of course  the steak is what you should be here for  and The Capital Grille is flat-out is incapable of disappointing. You cannot go wrong with any of their selections  but I am a Filet guy  so I usually ask to be hooked up Kona-style  which has a coffee crust. It literally melts in your mouth. Throw in some creamed spinach and their Lobster Mac-N-Cheese  and odds are you will compare every meal from then on to the Capital Grille. Oh  and tip well. The waiters and waitresses are great. Attentive and friendly no matter how busy the place is  in addition to always being quick with a clutch wine recommendation.\n",
      "Went to Capital for one of our friends birthdays and the food was amazing. We tried 1 appetizer  ordered 3 sides (including fries  mashed potatoes) and we all had a different meal. They were all incredible. When the meal was over  we decided to split 3 desserts and each one was amazing (I loved to coconut pie). The staff was very nice and the restaurant was really beautiful. The location was great  but the restaurant was pretty expensive.\n",
      "Good food  pretty good service  great location. Overall ratings: Food 5 Service 4 Atmosphere 4 Value 4 Ate here with a small group (7 people) in town for the election. We had just all finished going door to door and were about to watch election returns in a hotel ballroom. So we wanted something relaxing  delicious  fast  and in an atmosphere where we could talk to each other without shouting. Xiandu delivered on those goals. We reserved via Open Table  our table was ready and we were seated immediately. It took awhile for the server to come around and get drink orders  than a really long time for a) the drinks to arrive and b) for her to return for the food orders. Once ordered  food came pretty quickly  and it was totally delicious. This was at 7 PM on a Tuesday evening  the place was not at all crowded. So service should have been fast. Menu included some items with an Indian influence. I had panang curry which was great. They offer brown rice with meals  which I appreciate.  Beer selection was bottles only  pretty typical for Thai restaurants  and I had Kirin Ichiban which was scrumptious. A couple ordered a bottle of house Cabernet (they were out of the house Merlot) and they pronounced it fine  didn't sound outstanding. I can easily see returning  yet with so many outstanding choices in central city Philly  I'll make the rounds first.\n",
      "The best thai delivery in Philly. Amazingly fresh and delicious  albeit expensive.\n",
      "Woah  what a hidden gem! I say hidden because even though it's right there between 11th and 12th on Walnut  I have definitely never noticed this place. My bad...  About 15-20 of us came here for a friend's surprise birthday dinner (Happy 23rd Josephine!) this past Saturday. Although I was the last one to arrive before the big surprise (#traindrama)  I could see that the service was absolutely splendid from the beginning to the end. Since I came directly from the 'burbs  they were entirely okay with me leaving my bag with the hosts  as well as charging my phone towards the end.  The waiter (didn't get his name) was so  so helpful and described all of the entrees in greater detail. He also gave good vegetarian recommendations (shout-out to my fellow herbivores)  as well as informing us of what's popular at the restaurant. I ended up ordering the Panang curry with brown rice on a level 3 spice range  with 1 being the mildest and 5 being the spiciest. It was PERFECT. Everything  from the appearance to the spices  was just sublime. I was a bit upset that they took away my dish with a few bites left (I planned on finishing all of it!) when the cake came out. However  everything else was just so nice and I knew I was going to come back  so it didn't affect me toooo much. Since we had a large table  I wasn't sure what everyone else got  but it all looked pretty good. Can't wait to come back here on Friday for their lunch specials!  A special mention has to go out to the manager/Xiandu queen Nancy. She has got to be one of the coolest  kindest managers I have ever interacted with! She kept the place open well past their closing time to make sure we were well accommodated and not rushed out. This is just one of the many examples of true customer service. So many places simply view their customers as business transactions  but you could tell that this place truly wanted their customers to have a legit dining experience. Nancy  you're getting an official invite to our next outing because you are a BAUSS.  STOP EVERYTHING AND GO GET YOURSELF SOME XIANDU.\n",
      "DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY!!! The worst service I have ever encountered. When the delivery person came  she called me  and told me to hurry up because she had things to do. I told her I'd hurry  but explained I had to take the elevator down. She then yelled at me to be there in less than five minutes. I always tip  even when the service isn't the best. I was a waiter and it sucks sometimes  I get it. In this case  the service was absolutely terrible  so I didn't leave a tip. She looked at the receipt and demanded a tip. Straight up told me  you need to tip me. I said no  so she refused to give me my food even though I had already paid for it!! Then when I called the restaurant to tell them what happened  the guy was completely unapologetic  said ok a couple times and hung up on me.\n",
      "Other than for the Thai iced tea  which tasted weirdly soapy and smelled funny  the rest of the food was delicious. Especially the mango chicken and the chicken green curry. Large portions and the waiters are all really nice. This place is located in close proximity to other restaurants but I think this spot stands out from all the others. If you're in the area  and if you're in the mood for Thai  I'd give this place a try.\n",
      "I had an appetizer of Thai Spring rolls which were excellent and because I arrived prior to 7 pm Happy Hour prices were in effect.  I had yellow curry with chicken and added Chinese broccoli  bean sprouts and green vegetables.  It was mild but the spice tray was perfect and spiced it to my degree of taste.  There was more than enough for leftovers.  I got the Triple Mouse for dessert with hot Jasmine tea.  I would return here when I am back in Philly. I thought the meal was excellent. The service was very good and they had no problems with substituting ingredients due to individual preferences. Folks in Philly tend to eat dinner late so don't let the lack of customers fool you if you like to eat at 5 pm.\n",
      "Really wonderful food  wonderful service. We ordered the musselman and yellow curry and the pad Thai as well. Delicious!  The owner came up to chat with us and was very nice as well. We will definitely be back!!\n",
      "Beautifully presented food with excellent mix  of flavors.  We tried two of the chicken dishes on lunch special menu.  With soup and salad.  Only opened within a year.  Clean  modern decor. Happy hour too  5-7.  Best Thai spot we have found.\n",
      "Friendly and attentive service  reasonable prices  delicious food. The Massaman Curry with chicken was wonderful.\n",
      "To be fair  we got a lot of attention from the servers and the atmosphere was pretty good. If I had to make one suggestion  I would recommend not buying any dessert. Perhaps  I'm a dessert snob. Although the menu choices and photos will be tempting  the quality of the desserts (eating them rather than looking at the pictures) disappointed.  $7 each for presumably \\pre-made\\\" desserts did not impress.  At other restaurants in this City  you can get a highly trained professional chef to make some really elegant  sophisticated  delicate desserts in the $8-10 range  but not here. You won't find any sophisticated sweets here.  Desserts here are very \\\"conventional\\\" unrefined  vulgar. Tiramisu was really sweet - extra sweet - cake-style version with loads of sugar.  The Creme Brulee was thick and heavy like a very cold  barely thawed out pudding.  Neither dessert was prepared with an authentic recipe. I would venture to say they were manufactured to serve the convenience of the restaurant.  For dinner  I shared 1 appetizer  3 dishes  and 3 desserts with 2 friends. We all drank the regular tap water.  We ordered blackened sushi-grade fish  chicken red curry  grilled chicken with asparagus  and Rotti. The food was pretty good  but after tax and tip  we each paid about $36 for a total bill nearing $110. The chicken and fish dishes tasted good. Though I liked the fish and chicken dishes  I am not sure I will come back. Pretty good dinner  but there are many other interesting  good restaurants in Philly. Maybe I will come back to try once more  but not dessert and not anytime soon. The ratio  price : food experience seemed slightly unfavorable. If I am paying more than $35 for a meal  I have high expectations. I expect everything to be good  but in this case  dessert here was a flop.\"\n",
      "The BBQ is a little overrated here. So many people told me how fantastic this place was which probably ruined it for me as I went in with pretty high expectations. I lived in Texas for 3 years so that probably also ruined it as well. For philly standards  the BBQ is pretty good. For Texas standards  it's ok. The meat was a tad dry. The sides were ok but nothing spectacular. Also  it's a tad pricey. In 7 years of living in philly  I only went here once. It was worth a try but for the price and value I never came back here again.\n",
      "I was so so excited to get in to some brisket. I had tried the Fette Sau in Brooklyn and was impressed by the beef cheeks. Unfortunately  I paid over $15 for 3 slices of brisket that really lacked flavor. I dream about the melty fat produced by Austin's Franklin BBQ. This was not that kind of fat.\n",
      "Who would think that one of the best bbq places I've been to is in Philadelphia. A great evening catching up with with one of the most incredible people I know  Kristin Parker Serrano and her husband.   The brisket was cooked to perfection. As we're the short ribs  and pulled pork. My favorite side was the spicy cole slaw.   Lose a star because the success need a little work. Spicy is not. .vinegar was watery. I don't do sweet so can't comment on that.\n",
      "Let me start by saying I'm a BBQ snob. I'm not an a-hole about it  but I really don't eat BBQ unless I'm behind the smoker. I spent 15 years in Kansas City so I know a bit about the craft.  Waking in  I liked the atmosphere. Mix matched chairs at wooden tables  tractor seats at the bar. It feels like we're eating at a roadside bbq joint.  Next we ordered drinks. I picked a local brewery on tap  my friend picked from a huge selection of whisky.  While he was getting settled  I admired the BBQ selections. In addition to chalk board descriptions  the the freshly smoked meats are in a case for all to admire. The meat is sold by the pound which allows me to make my own mixed plate! I chose brisket  ribs  pulled pork and mac n cheese. They were all smoky  which is my first test. I don't use sauce unless it's really necessary. Second  they all had a great bark. The brisket had the best crunch. Lastly  the Mac n cheese was smoky with jalapeno heat. Loved it.  All in all  this Virginia based  Missouri taught BBQ jerk enjoyed the whole experience.  Next time I'm in Philly  I'm skipping the cheesesteak  and spending my hard earned money on quality BBQ.\n",
      "I'm a huge fan of the original Brooklyn location  and this Philly branch has also managed to score high points in my book.  Though the prices are still crazy steep  the barbecue is still insanely delicious (mmm  brisket and pulled pork) and their vinegar-based potato salad is by far the best I've had in the city.  Also grateful that the space is much larger in this location than the Brooklyn one -- generous outdoor seating for the summertime  and also a bunch of indoor seats if you're sun-phobic or want to be close to the huge bar full of booze.\n",
      "These guys are as good as it gets I live in N Libs so it's a short walk.  The atmosphere is just great.  Open and friendly.  There is a nice bar where you can order up an excellent manhattan and a nice variety of beers.  The food  well  they knock it out of the park with pretty much everything so you can't go wrong.  You order up front and take the food to the table where you have a selection of excellent BBQ sauce.   I would absolutely recommend the ribs or pulled pork.  So  great atmosphere  reasonable prices  great service and superior food.\n",
      "Happy hour special  hands down best deal around for good food and cheap drinks.\n",
      "There were 5 of us and we ordered a ton of food! Whole chicken  lb of brisket  lb of ribs  2 mac & cheeses  baked beans and broccoli salad. Came to $20 a person so it wasn't bad at all. Definitely would go again. Everything was really good except for the broccoli salad. It had too much vinegar.\n",
      "Great place to convene with a group of friends for drinks. Only had the food once and it was delicious.  Shout out to the awesome bartender Lindsey (blue hair  sweet tats) who is a miracle worker at the peak of happy hour! I am convinced she has 10 arms. No matter how many people swarming the bar for drinks  she gets to everyone in record time.\n",
      "- TIP:  Superb happy hour if you like whiskey & beer.  Half off manhattans  old fashioneds  and all beers (which are served in 8oz  16oz  32oz  or 64oz jars).  - CON:  Bar can get overwhelmed  meaning it takes too long to get a drink sometimes.  - BOTTOM LINE:  Great atmosphere with great BBQ meats and sides.  Don't miss the beans with burnt ends.  Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the sauces are just OK  and the bar can be a service bottleneck.\n",
      "Wings are unique  but good. Downstairs bar is better than upstairs. Table service was pretty slow and they couldn't figure out how to split a check for a large group.\n",
      "This is my go-to restaurant when I'm craving buffalo wings/a cheap and yummy meal. My husband took me here while we were still dating and we have been chowing down on the buffalo wings and Spanish fries ever since!  You can't go wrong. Great wings  either naked or covered in buffalo sauce. The Spanish fries are the perfect complement.   Tip: don't breathe in the wings because the hot sauce will make you cough.\n",
      "This was my home away from home when I lived a few blocks away. Their Irish potato soup rocks and their burger's are huge. My favorite thing is that they have woodchuck on tap.  If you can find the room   their apple crisp is yummy (and meant for sharing). The service can be a little slow  but that never put a damper on my good time.\n",
      "Went on a Friday night  so it was pretty loud and crowded. I went to meet friends  and sat in the back. For being so crowded  the wait staff was always available and attentive. I didn't grab a bite to eat  but everyone who did said the food was pretty good. I had a few beers  their beer list isn't the best  but certainly isn't the worst. T  The prices were pretty good for the area. Pretty good for a casual group get together  if you're looking for a place to take a date  I'd advise elsewhere only because of the level of noise and how dark it is inside.\n",
      "Stopped in July 4th in the afternoon.  Great atmosphere.  Had the wings which were fantastic but even better was the bartender  Megan  absolutely yummy....ooops sorry  I digress.  Seriously had a great time.  Would recommend to everyone\n",
      "Good beer selection  good crowd.  I stopped in on a Sunday night  based on the reviews here. Wide selection of draft beers  including at least 6 \\new\\\" beers  which I assume means \\\"rotating selection\\\". Ordered a Philly steak  which I can't compare to anything else because I am from Seattle. Good  but not excellent.  Not too loud  lots of sports TV.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Best wings in Philly  period. And if you're not much of a wing person  they have plenty of other delicious Irish plates and sandwiches to choose from. A bar as well! Only thing is is that it can get pretty noisy and tight in there if it's packed  but the food is well worth a visit.\n",
      "Great wings  really tasty and you get a ton of them. Not too expensive  nice people  good atmosphere and location. Highly recommended\n",
      "Moriarty's dishes out one killer spinach dip.  Accompanied by warm pita  this dip is served in a small bowl and is mixed with the perfect amount of fresh cream and artichokes. And it's no skimpy portion  either! Add extra pita for $1...you're likely to need two helpings. This is currently my favorite dip in the city -- by far -- and you should probably give it a shot if you're into spinach.  On a meatier note  I keep hearing about their wings here  but I'm more into burgers  so I've ordered the Locust Street (bacon and cheese) burger a couple times now. It's standard  cooked to your request  and comes with pretty good fries.  Staff here has always been friendly and I love the decor and ambiance. It's such a relaxing place to spend an afternoon with a good drink or a series of tasters. Definitely need to visit more often!\n",
      "Walked by this place and decided to check it out. Great beer and burger place  made even better knowing many things were organic. You can order from the menu  or create your own burger. They also have rotating beers and specials. Nice atmosphere and staff. Burgers don't come with anything  so order from the sides if you want some fries. (There's also sandwiches and salads if you don't want a burger) Vegetarian friendly.\n",
      "I was trying to find a decent place for dinner tonight for my moderately health conscious self when I came across this place. After figuring out what I wanted and put the Be My Bison burger in my cart for the online order  I realized it would be over a two mile round trip excursion from my job. Defeated  I started to search elsewhere but I could not get that burger off of my mind. I came back a few hours later and submit my order. I hiked it there and it just came out of the kitchen as I walked in.  I grabbed my burger and continued on my way back to work. O-M-G! Absolutely in love with this place. It has been quite the task to try and find healthy places that fit my diet but this is a dream come true! Thank You!\n",
      "Stopped for a very healthy burger while visiting Philly after performing a nearby Prince tribute show  discovered one of the greatest burger places on planet earth! Thank you Alya & company at Bareburger!!  (-:   Andrew von Gregor  Pro Session & Touring Guitarist  Los Angeles\n",
      "Terrible service  food came out cold even after waiting about 1 hour during lunch  way too pricey. Don't waste your time.\n",
      "Awesome burgers. I went adventurous and tried the Wiki Wiki  which is wild boar with duck bacon. My wife had the Buckaroo which was a beef patty topped with brisket. Both were very tasty. A little on the smaller side  but great flavors make up for it in spades. Fries and rings were great too.\n",
      "Ready for some unique meat burgers?  From Bison to Elk  Bareburger has you covered. Not to be left out  they also boast a nice selection for vegetarians.  While here on a visit  I had the El Matador.  A Bison burger with Queso Fresco  pickled jalapenos  guacomole. green leaf  and pico de gallo on a brioche bun.   Can you say mouth party?!  Between the juiciness of the bison burger and the snap of the jalapenos & pico de gallo  I was delighted.   In addition to my burger I noshed on the spicy pickles and fries with an assortment of dips.   If I ever find myself in the area again  I will not hesitate to make stop.\n",
      "To update  the business owner has been in contact and has apologized and made up for it. Overall the Bareburger experience in Center City does have potential to be a good restaurant to check out.\n",

      "I actually can't tell you exactly why I feel this way but this is one of my favorite places to eat in Philly. For me  this is Philly eating.   They serve hamantaschen year round and maybe the deliciousness of this pastry was the kicker for me. Every corner had a good amount of apricot in it and the texture was like the most moist butter cookie you could imagine. It was so delicious that i stopped by again later in the afternoon to pick up another for my road trip that evening.  I like that they have novie  a less salty lox  amongst a billion other options.   Every time I've eaten here it's been delicious. Even the coffee is fantastic. I've always left stuffed but still wanting to try more. Can't walk past those desserts  breads  and meats and not want to try ALL of them!\n",
      "I loved the food here. They give very large portions  and is very tasty. The atmosphere was excellent  almost giving a New York feel. I'd definitely go back again.\n",
      "It is just too much of everything. If you want the good  ORIGINAL take no names cookie  find the original owners in the back of the reading terminal market.  I can't go back here because the challah french toast so overwhelmed me that I almost lost it.\n",
      "This is a restaurant with EPIC PORTIONS! No I didn't mix my words  I meant portions. The matzo ball in my soup was the size of a softball and Dining Partner's corned beef sandwich required him to dislocate his jaw in order to bite into it. The free fresh baked cookies at the end of our meal was a bonus treat. Quick service on a Saturday afternoon around 11. Best Jewish deli in the city!\n",
      "Wow. Sandwiches are huge! I was with two big dudes that can put down a lot of food and not even they could finish more than half a sandwich. It is a little pricey  but if you go with someone else and split an entree it wouldn't be too bad. The strawberry cheesecake was amazing. I like the atmosphere. Overall a good meal with plenty of leftovers.\n",
      "How could I have missed writing a review of 4th Street Deli after all these years??? I never go \\home\\\" without stopping here. Ever.   Forget the fact that this is the real deal. Forget the fact that ogling the monster-sized deserts in the front is a sport. Forget the fact that the sandwiches  with fantabulous and fresh ingredients  are big enough to feed a family of 6. Forget that the pickles and coleslaw that are served at every table remind me of my childhood. And forget the fact that the matzo balls in the most delicious soup I've ever had are the size of my head.   The cincher is the fresh  yummy cookies they serve with the check!  Now if only the owner would open in San Fran....\"\n",
      "If i were to recommend a place to have a great sandwich in philadelphia this would be the place I would recommend.   First off  come with an appetite  because the sandwiches are seriously huge! get the Zaftig if you're REALLY hungry. The meat is so fresh and tasty and the staff is really friendly.    Get the smoked turkey Reuben you will not regret it.\n",
      "May family and I came here for brunch.  We tried their signature pastrami sandwich and also the pastrami and scrambled eggs that we were hearing about.  The food was good  but not great.  The pastrami was fresh but somehow on the plain side to our taste.  Overall  it's a nice place  the staff are friendly  and the prices are ok.\n",
      "I was taken to 4th St deli because of my love of pastrami. I only got take out and the pastrami sandwich I got was huge!! I got it on a roll. The roll taste fantastic I would go back just for the rolls  very fresh and tasty like it was baked on the premise OK back to the place  very clean  courteous  service  great food the pastrami tastes good but not as good as Katz in NYC I will return again.\n",

      "Best french restaurant in all of Philadelphia and I'd venture to say best french restaurant I have ever been to.  The food is always executed perfectly and the service is amazing.  I have never had a bad meal or even a sub-par meal here.  Consistency is the hardest thing in a restaurant and this place just \\gets it\\\".  I'm not a big \\\"bread person\\\" but their baguette and butter is out of this world!  The atmosphere is beautiful and I love the ambiance of the dining area.  I usually get the seasonal salad  seasonal soup  and the veal sweetbreads and am never disappointed.  The wine is delicious (and a great value) and my fiance loves their selection of absinthe!\"\n",
      "Normally I do not review a restaurant after one meal  but there are exceptions. This is one. My wife Karin and I are BYOBers. However  for our two anniversary days  one when we met and four days later for our first date  we like to visit top notch restaurants who have a liquor license. We chose to have lunch at Bistro La Minette for our anniversary. What a wonderful treat that was. Ambiance: it was quiet on a Saturday afternoon. We like the feel of the room  simple  clean  airy.  Service: our server Lily was wonderful. She was professional  friendly  interesting  knowledgeable. We enjoyed chatting with her. She added much to our experience. Food: was tasty  well presented  flavorful and  at times  wow moments. We chose the lunch prix- fixe. Karin had the chilled pea soup with creme fraiche and mint. It was like eating in the garden. She chose the trout for her main. It was very good  loved the fingerling potatoes. I chose the escargot  a classic French dish. Delish. For my main  I chose the oeufs du pecheur  a very  very tasty dish. Baguette toast  two poached eggs  mussels in a tarragon cream sauce. The sauce was absolutely divine. For dessert  we had the chocolate pot de creme and the puff pastry with pastry cream and raspberries. Wonderful. The baguette was cooked in house and it reminded us of Paris. We were treated to a small glass of Banyuls  a Southern French port like dessert wine and a Sauterne. Thanks. With the check came two chocolate truffles  placed on a large serving dish. The dish was decorated with chocolate wishing us a Happy Anniversary. A wonderful touch and a wonderful finish to a great lunch. We won't forget that experience anytime soon.\n",
      "AMAZING!  My boyfriend made surprise reservations here for our anniversary.  Apparently reservations were a little tricky a week ahead of time and after experiencing dinner tonight I completely understand why!  We started with Frog Legs and a Salad - both fantastic (my boyfriend refuses to eat salad but actually liked this salad!).  For our main course I had the Faux Filet Sauce au Poive (black pepper-crusted New York strip with pomme puree and bacon-wrapped haricot verts) which was not only the best steak either one of us has ever tasted  but honestly the best meal I've ever had!  My boyfriend had the duck  which was new tonight so I cant give a better description because it's not on their menu yet  but it was as delicious as the steak.  We kept trading bites because neither of use was willing to give up a bite without an equal trade - haha :P  We're grad students so we can't afford fancy meals that often but this was definitely worth it!  We'll certainly be back the next time we have a special occasion.\n",
      "When my wife and I  first dined here...she just smiled.  She lived in France for many years.  We have both dined many times in Paris and other areas of France and Europe.  A true experience in the quality  outcome of the product  ambience   and overall cost.  Nothing more needs to be said.  Keep up the good work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have dined here several times  but last night was over the top wonderful... They now offer a chef's tasting menu that is a superb value (5 or 7 courses) we chose five with wine pairings... (similar chef's menus at snootier places in the US would cost about four times this and not be any better...say \\Inn at Little Washington\\\" which we visited this past fall). We actually were given more than five courses but lost track. For 55 dollars you cannot beat this (wine pairings an extra 20 pp). Not each guest receives everything the same making it even more fun - they will give you the option to include or exclude anything that you really want or do not want. Kir Royale came first  On the food side we started with snails in the most amazing butter garlic sauce with delcious bread. Delectable beet salad came next with golden beet puree and a pink square that was wonderful goat cheese all served with a provencal style dry rose' wine - perfect...  some of the other dishes were mustard braised rabbit with homemade delicate and airy tagliatelle  pork cheek bourginon  choices of wines were offered  pinot noir for the rabbit  and cabernet blend for the pork  fisherman style poached egg with mussels and mild tarragon cream sauce  - outrageous  sweetbreads   terrine de fois gras pate with pear.... chef will alternate and vary... all the portions were more adequate and filling than competing more expensive establishments...two fantastic desserts included mille feuille delicate pastry with raspberries and chocolate mousse cake ( amazingly good)... we must have had about ten different dishes... servers were all so nice  the chef came out a few times and was pleased that we had ordered this... presentation was gorgeous.  Could not be more pleased... This restaurant also has a charming bar area  nice cocktails and the ambience of a true French bistro complete with hammered tin ceiling  lighting  etc. The only issues is that seating is tight and the restaurant is narrow - difficult to get private table for two as most tables have you pretty close to other diners. There is French soundtrack music that adds to the wonderful experience. Outstanding waitstaff  experienced  well-run restaurant even on a very busy evening.\"\n",
      "Amazing food.  Great service.  Intimate space.  I've been here a few times over the past couple of months and have to say each time I leave  I am planning my next trip back.  Each time I've dined at Bistrot  our party has been the last to leave...literally shutting the place down.  And the staff continues to smile  no dirty  \\get the hell out of here\\\" looks from them.    The chef (Peter Woolsely) is equally as gracious as his staff  stopping by each table to chat throughout the service.  I'm so happy that this place is consistently busy and receiving such great feedback because he seems like a genuinely nice  hardworking guy who deserves the praise!  The food...well  the food is amazing.  Simple  yet unique.  The rabbit is by far one of the better dishes on the menu  in my opinion  and worth a try even if you are hesitant about well  eating rabbit.  Portion sizes are substantial yet not so small that you feel like you paid a lot for nothing.  Of course for dessert  the creme brulee...\"\n",
      "I went for their 3 year anniversary and recently went back and both times were fantastic. The food is rich and delicious  their wine/beer selection is a nice complement and the servers are very attentative and courteous.   Must get the mussels with poached egg appetitizer  it is amazing!!!\n",
      "Found this place via yelp  my family and i were in town for the holiday and this restaurant was very close to where we were staying. The pictures looked very tasty  so why not? On another note  this was also my first time having a French meal  so I was very excited.  The restaurant felt very cozy  and intimate. I don't suggest a party of more than 4 people  because the tables are put very close together  anymore than 4 would be a bit uncomfortable.  Ceuf du pecheur  escargots a la bourguignonne  terrine de four gras  faux-filet de bceuf sauce foie gras  lapin roti a la moutarde  joues de porc a la  bourguignonne  The fishermen's style poached egg - loved it  5 The snails - the presentation of this dish was very very elegant (looks expensive)  but as far as the taste  it was kind of bland.... So... a 2 for the taste  and 5 for the image. The vanilla scented duck - very interesting taste  something I definitely have not taste before. The first bite was intense... Very strong vanilla taste  wasn't a fan of the meat... I believe this dish is suppose to be served cold  I'm glad I tried this dish because it is definitely very interesting but just not my taste... So um.. 2..... The steak - bomb  5 The pork cheeks - the sauce was extra salty... The meat was bit dry... The presentation of the dish was poor  the meat was dark  the sauce was dark  couldn't really see what the dish looked like. So a 2. The rabbit - id rather not discuss this dish... Or rate it  so you can try it on your own.  Good customer service  couldn't ask for more. My server was very attentive.   Overall  it was a nice experience. Food was decent  but not amazing.\n",
      "Good beer selection  knowledgeable staff. Had I not ordered food here it would have an enjoyable experience. Some how received undercooked inedible Fries  one well done burger and one burger medium rare.... both burgers were served on buns that felt straight out of the refrigerator  slightly hard and cold. If you're drunk the foods good  don't eat it sober  plus add in service that was lackluster at best. We couldn't even eat the food and left it untouched. We told the the bartender no we didn't want it and what was wrong with it. Charged us full price.\n",
      "Nice  old school space with a long bar. It reminded me of some places I've been out west  which might be a little strange in the heart of Philadelphia.   Not too loud at all - conversations were easy and a lot of the patrons were doing just that. There's a jukebox  so maybe it cranks up later in the evening. We were there pretty early.   Great service from several people working behind the bar.   Several beers on tap including a local CCCCC IPA  which was solid. Not many wines  though.  Small menu but very good food. The elote (corn) is quite good  as was the cucumber(?) salad. But the brat plate was the star. Wonderful brat  German potato salad  sauerkraut  pretzel and a hot salsa/relish. Best brat plate ever. Served on a cool wood board.  Prohibition is located in or near a somewhat dicey neighborhood  at least to this non-resident's eye. I may very well be wrong about that. We had to walk a trashy  pissy street past what seemed like skid row coming from the hotel on Race St. If it was later at night we might have chosen not to walk back.\n",
      "Great food. Awesome beer selection. Found this place by accident  definitely worth it. Can't remember the name of the burger I had  but it was topped with pork roll  onions and a fried egg.\n",
      "If you're going to a show at the Union Transfer / Underground Arts / Electric Factory  then this bar is in a nice location for a couple of beers and food. I don't think I would make a trip across town to come and drink here  but I would definitely stop by again before a show.  Food:  Menu is a small selection of typical bar food  but with what little they have  they do it well and tastefully. The brat plate was a nice  filling $15 deal if you want a little bit of everything. Fish & chips came out freshly fried and piping hot. Definitely several notches higher than your average bar food.  Drinks:  Beer centric  but it's not like you can't get wine and cocktails...just noticeably limited.  Space:  Cozy  so it can get crowded pretty easily -- not really a place to hang out all night.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really like it at this bar. I wish I lived closer because it is a great bar to hang out with friends or even for a simple date night.  The beer is good and there is always a lot on tap as well as in bottles. There food is surprisingly good too. The french fries are killer shoestring fries  their mac and cheese is pretty good  and the fried green beans are great!  I did not like the polenta fries  but the rest of the food made up for it.  I would recommend getting a bunch of apps and splitting them  which is what I've done with friends.\n",
      "Really cool bar with a nice staff and awesome ambiance.  I live nearby and it's my go to neighborhood spot. It can easily get to be a pricey experience if you aren't careful  but you get what you pay for! The quality and variety of the beers are great. They come in a range of prices  strengths  and styles from breweries all over! The prices aren't even that bad when compared to how much these beers would cost at a \\classy\\\" place in center city.  The food is great too! I'm a big fan of the burger and fries.\"\n",
      "My review is from a Sat brunch visit. I've never been at night so it could be quite good as a bar to frequent.  That said their breakfast was OK  nothing to write home about - in fact there's a cafe right across the street (cafe lift) and I would argue they have a much more tasty brunch option. That said this place definitely has great options for watching games and seating with groups at a bar.\n",
      "Feeling compelled to write this review laying in bed  dreaming about the Pro Tap Burger - what every other burger out there wants to be when it grows up. I don't love this burger just because it's literally a block away from me - I would walk 500 miles to fall down at Pro Taps door for this burger. I am also a HUGE fan of brioche buns. Fries are covered in a garlicky herb situation unlike any you've had before. Do yourself a favor and skip your kids recital  blow off that friend you've been playing phone tag with for weeks... but don't bring your friend who's all like \\are these gluten free vegan fries?\\\"... get some of their seriously awesome beers  a burger  maybe start off w some of their mac and cheese? I'm just sayin.....\"\n",
      "Went for Sunday brunch. Arrived a little after 11 and the place was empty. Service was friendly and helpful. Prices on food were good  but drink prices were a little high. Definitely cheaper in Old City. Anyway  the food was great. Fresh and hot and huge portions  neither of us could come close to finishing. Only food complaint was the bacon was way under cooked  needs to be crisper. By the time we left  the place had started to fill up  so get there early for a spot. Definitely will return.\n",
      "I am not known for favorable restaurant reviews.  Most of them below my radar. The Love is different.     We had a Father's Day lunch that was exceptional. There is little left off the menu and we were hard pressed to make a choice from the wonderful selections listed.  Our waiter was professional and accommodating.  Lovely atmosphere  light and bright.  I was amazed that the inside of my omelet was HOT. A little surprise thrown in with my Potatos..........roasted peppers  and onions. Greens on every plate. Mine had warm spinach salad as well. My husband had the Belgium waffles made with corn meal and garnished with Blueberry butter.  They use our favorite La Columbe coffee. Nothing left to wish for.\n",
      "This is an excellent restaurant  and an excellent addition to the neighborhood around Rittenhouse. We dined here last night  and were very happy. The ambiance and interior design are top notch. It's very impressive how the space has been transformed from the previous tenant. The food was outstanding  which is unsurprising considering the chef's pedigree. We had two lovely cocktails and a whole fish that was perfectly cooked along with a terrific short rib play on stroganoff. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is that those cocktails and two entrees ended up costing $140. The Love is really good  but it's also surprisingly expensive. Entrees are priced in the $30-$40 range and appetizers and pastas are not far behind. The Love bills itself as a neighborhood restaurant  and it would be  perhaps  the platonic ideal of that if the prices dropped by a third. As is  it's as expensive as any non-tasting menu restaurant in Philly. Is that worth it when you can eat for less up the block at Vernick  etc? I'm not totally sure. I'll definitely be back  and I hope the menu prices find an equilibrium with the awesome vibe and food--I'd love to make it a real regular haunt.\n",
      "I recently took my Father to The Love to celebrate his birthday and Father's Day! When I made my reservation  I made a note of those celebrations and upon being greeted by the hostess that was the first thing they addressed with my sweet Papa!   The ambience is really hip  and it's a fairly intimate setting. We were seated in their booth style cushioned seats which was very comfortable. I am a booth girl all the way!  I ordered he shrimp and grits with baby buttermilk biscuits and my Dad ordered the catfish and hush puppies in his true southern style. Can we talk about those biscuits?! So delicious. Words cannot express why I ate 5 of them in one sitting. The shrimp and grits were great  and that's coming from someone who NEVER eats grits. My Dad was less impressed with the catfish and hush puppies  but that's coming from someone who was born and raised in the South. I tried the hush puppies as well and they paled in comparison to the biscuits.   Our server was very sweet and fairly attentive given the packed restaurant. For the total experience I would return. If I want truly amazing southern food (despite their menu) I would go elsewhere.\n",
      "Farm to table done right! Glad Dandelion was packed so we discovered this. The food was very flavorful  the fresh ingredients really popped. We had Saturday brunch  will definitely return to try the regular menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "Snooty  noisy and expensive. Food is ok and location is good but the staff are snobs ( hard to fathom why ) and the acoustics make for uncomfortable l veld of noise.  Not with it.\n",
      "The ambiance is definitely the best part of the restaurant.  It's a very social  but intimate vibe  with an excellent drink menu.  The cocktails are a bit sweet for my taste.  The tables are a little too close together for my taste  but there's a nice buzz to the restaurant.  The food was good.  It wasn't stellar.  And at that price  especially in Philadelphia (where there are really amazing restaurants)  it should be better.  The brussell sprouts are heavy and delicious.  The salmon tartare left much to be desired.  The salmon latke dish was good  but there was nothing interesting about it.  Ultimately  it was a good date spot  but nothing to write home about\n",
      "I cannot say enough good about The Love. You feel the love. The food is delicious and well presented. Our server Sophie was a delight. This was our second visit and we will return. I recommend the crudités  fried chicken (a must)  ravioli and whatever dessert they are offering \n",
      "Overall great experience  vibe  location and atmosphere.  Great service and food Bread should be included - not extra Poke was very good - but should be tuna.  Cheese plate was great Fried chicken - very good- but not the best I've ever had  moist and delicious though  jalapeno grits tasty  collard greens very good Strogranoff was good- meet a little dry  could have been a little more flavorful Overall deserts were a let down- mousse was ok  cookie tray average- only saving grace was the caramel/toffee  carrot cake sunday- meh.  Lastly - everytime they brought a course they gave the plates and drinks to the wrong person- I'm sure this will improve with time Wine list decent - but way over priced. We will return- and I'm sure some of these things will improve.\n",
      "My boyfriend and I tried The Love for the first time Saturday evening of Memorial Day Weekend. The city is usually pretty empty on holiday weekends - but Love was still packed. Nothing on the menu really spoke to me as something I just had to have  but he had really been wanting to try this place. I\\m glad I listened! We started with the duck salad - fantastic! We had the lobster spaghetti and the crab pasta special as entrees - both good but the lobster spaghetti was the winner. We also finished with a cheese plate and the cookie tray - I was skeptical that a cheese plate could be $20 good  but it absolutely was! Definitely a pricier dinner - but all high quality ingredients and worth the money. Good service as well - paced the different courses well and check on us just enough. Will definitely be back!\"\n",
      "We stopped in for brunch and we weren't expecting the food to be so delicious.  The 3 meat hash was amazing  as was the turkey sandwich and bagel salmon.  The employees were very friendly and accommodating.  A little pricey  but well worth.  We will visit again if in the area.\n",
      "I like this place a lot. I stopped in once with friends for drinks and was eager to return for food. We finally did over the weekend.   The ambience is very nice -- somehow ideal for both a fun date as well as for a beer and sports crowd.   I love the open kitchen.   Great beer selection.   I'll definitely return for the rosemary fries  and my fiancée will return for the very good house burger.\n",
      "Went here with a few friends as the place to have our reunion dinner. We hadn't seen eachother since elementary school and got reacquainted through Facebook so this was a pretty special dinner.   The restaurant is very swanky and the prices show this. I do think the food was worth the price although all of my party thought it was very expensive. I ordered the lobster bake which was delicious. It was not fantastic and there wasn't alot of seafood but it was adequate for me. I also ordered a Neopolitan Old Fashion which was made perfectly.   My friends ordered the fritters  carpaccio  crab cake and fries. Plus 2 shots of tequila  a lemonade and 2 more old fashions. Bill was $170 which is not bad but some of my friends weren't expected it.   And I must say something about our waiter. Unfortunately  I didn't remember his name but he was fantastic! Very attentive  nice and even bought out a dessert because it was also one of my friend's bday. He was just real cool.   5 stars for service 3 stars for food 4 stars for ambience  2 stars for price.    But I was satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "i was staying at the lovely Hotel Monaco (to which this bar is connected to) and figured that I would give this place a try.  The vibe is just a little uptight.  A bit like a sports bar.  I attempted to venture upstairs when I was accosted by a very tall  very bald doorman who looked like he was going to burst a blood vessel as he brusquely steered me away from that area  explaining that it was only for diners.  Ok Max Headroom!  Get your prescription changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Red Owl Tavern is conveniently connected to the hotel and also open to the general public  thus providing a stylishly casual setting to enjoy a meal or cocktail. On a recent weekend trip to Philly  we stayed at the Hotel Monaco  parked our car  and enjoyed the area. Because our weekend was packed with family events  Red Owl offered a place for us to stop in for a quick bite or drink  without the stuffy hotel bar/restaurant feel.    In a three day period  we somehow managed to experience happy hour  drinks  and brunch. The charcuterie platter was substantial and thoughtfully crafted  the perfect pair to a locally brewed pint. Also recommended: the donuts.  Brunch menu items range from healthy to traditional  the potatoes are delicious. Note that the bloody marys are chock full of horseradish--I enjoy a spicy bloody  but we had to order extra tomato juice to balance the flavor.  All in all  Red Owl took the guesswork out of navigating the neighborhood between events  offering variety and friendly service to keep us coming back.\n",
      "It's a nice two-leveled tavern  right across from Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries and besides it being a little on the spicy side (for me - I have a very low heat tolerance) it was very satisfying! The service was speedy and the atmosphere was relaxed (of course  this was before the lunch rush) but I would recommend for anyone in the area.\n",
      "I was in Philly on a Sunday night  and unsure of where to go to eat. I am hardly ever out by myself in the city  so I was nervous to go to a bar without friends  as I wasn't in the mood to fight off guys trying to talk to me. My uber driver recommended the Red Owl Tavern  so that is where I ended up that night. I was greeted by a very friendly hostess who I told I wanted to sit at the bar  as it seemed that was where all the activity was going on. As someone who pretty much never drinks  I had no idea what to order  and most times the bartender will look at me like I'm an idiot when I ask what they suggest I would like. This was not the case this time  the bartender was one of the nicest and most friendly guys I had ever met (and pretty handsome too). He was able to explain all the drinks on the menu and suggest the ones he thought I would like the most. He told me his name was Mirek  and if I was in the area more  I would definitely come back. Food was a high price  but well worth it. Thank you for the wonderful service!!\n",
      "All around class-act place. Really sharp looking bar and restaurant. We were just in for drinks but the food looked good. Casual modern and upscale place in a historic setting.   From the hostess to the concierge everybody was very friendly. The bearded bartender was the star of the show. Nice to find a place with bartenders with personality.\n",
      "Love the atmosphere  the space  the staff and the drinks. Frozen watermelon Marg is divine. Don't love the food though. The tacos are just not that great  especially for the price. The exception is the churros - but get some leche dip! I've been a few times now so obviously it's worth the patronage but the search for a real taco continues...\n",
      "OBSESSED with the green juice margarita -- a delicious contradiction for those health nuts at happy hour. Chili-salt rim is a must.  Lots of options/variety on the menu  including the salsas. (Coconut hazelnut was interesting...in a good way!) Ordered the lamb  mahi mahi and special pork belly tacos. We all agreed the fish tacos severely lacked flavor  and while the other two were better  we weren't blown away. (I'd give the edge to lamb.)  Decor was nice -- lots of natural light for my annoying foodie pics. A 20% tip was automatically included for our group of six  which explains why our server ignored us for loooong stretches of time even before we ordered. :-/\n",
      "How did I find this place ? My friend said he knew a local bowling joint  so we mistakenly went here. Whoops but the food and service did not disappoint. I went here again with another friend  better informed this time  and we got the nachos and trees leche for dessert. The price range was really good and my friend really enjoyed the \\cute\\\" decorations. The atmosphere was nice and cozy. It felt like an indoor picnic type environment.  The portions of the meals were a good portion. I can complain. The service was kind and welcoming to offer her opinion and recommendations. She really made our first time.   Overall  this place is nice. Bring your friends  co-workers  or a date here. It can get kinda crowded during their busier hours. They usually take reservations with parties roughly six or more.\"\n",
      "Love this place! The decor is amazing and I love how airy and fresh it looks. I've been here for lunch a few times and it has been a great crowd pleaser. I never get burritos but here I make an exception. Great ingredients ratio and so well seasoned. To top it off THEY GRILL IT so the tortilla is warm and toasted. I love it so much I want to go right now.   The tacos and corn elote are nice as well and the salsas are a great addition! I love dessert and their desserts do not disappoint get them all. As I wrote this review I made plans to go with a coworker tomorrow. The service was wonderful the staff was helpful and informed. They also put my picky eater coworkers mind at ease and were able to guide him through the menu  he ended up loving his sandwich!\n",
      "I love the way this restaurant looks  it's fun to be here and it's really modern and clean. There are really cool free taco temp tattoos at the hostess's desk so make sure to grab one on your way in or out.  There's a foosball table in the middle of the restaurant which is fun  and there's a bunch of places to sit  tables  the bar  booths  window seats  etc.  The nachos are a MUST get  with goat chili - who knew how amazing that would be. The tacos are ok I've had better but I've also had worse  the horchata is also hit or miss. I've been here 2 times so far and the first time the horchata was delicious and the second it was kind of gross. Not sure what's up with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice atmosphere and aesthetics. They have plants all around the place! A little more expensive that I would like to pay on a regular basis but good food  good service and good drinks!\n",

      "I went there for lunch.  Nice  bright space.  Nice selection of drinks.  However  my chicken burrito was disappointing  a lot of rice and not much chicken.\n",
      "This new Mexican spot re-imagines and maximizes the space once completely under-utilized by Nodding Head.  The bar is great  tile work on and behind the bar is impressive.  Drink selection is what you would expect  other CC bars have better tequila offerings  but this is acceptable.  The little atrium in the center is awesome  took me a few minutes to realize it was open air.    With that said  the food was so so.   I wouldn't want to sugar coat the food by any other classification.  The guac was what you would expect at a basic suburban party  no real defining flavor  and way too much citrus.  I had high expectation for the tacos  they just weren't good.  Tried the chorizo rojo  grilled skirt steak  and the mahi mahi...nothing I would go back for  mahi was by far the best  but even the flash frying was not done right.  With the right leadership in the kitchen  these could all be easily correctable  it's a shame to see such laziness accepted.  Even though the food was less than average  I'll be back  but only for drinks.\n",
      "by 3 stars  i really mean 3.5-  white brick walls  cool rustic furniture  seasoned  attractive employees. and the lighting is lovely.. nay  PERFECT. probably good for a blind date.  and service is good and timely.  but 3.5 could've been 4 if it wasn't so expensive for what i'm getting. and if the kitchen was more accommodating.  the first time i ever ate there  (around when it first opened)  i ordered ravioli and received 3 or 5 pieces for $11-13.  another time i visited  i tried substituting a salad for fries with my burger. and my server said  \\no  sorry  the kitchen won't do that.\\\"   are you $^%ER@# kidding me??? it wasn't a super modification. it's not as if i asked for a burger with only one bun  no tomato  half piece of lettuce  two onion rings  and love. it wasn't like i wanted to substitute lobster for fries!!! needless to say  this is the first time i've been unable to substitute. i'm usually really easy to please  but this is the first time i've ever felt difficult. at least in my head. is this in my head?  unforgivable.\"\n",

      "It pains me to write this  but I fear I must...  I used to really enjoy P&K as a lively neighborhood spot with elevated pub food. But yesterday in the early evening  the place was overrun with drunken frat boys dropping f-bombs at top volume and shouting about their exploits as rapists. After multiple parties complained  asked to be moved  or left altogether  what did the management do? NOTHING! Just kept serving them more beer.  It's hard to justify $25-$30 dishes when the atmosphere is that of no-class dive bar. And skip the octopus. It's overcooked and rubbery.  To be fair  the oysters were excellent  hence the second star.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right around the corner from our house - this is our (my husband and I) go to for everything! Brunch  a cocktail  a late night snack  a date night!   We love pub and kitchen so much - such a cool vibe and such great people  the food is the best too :)  Love it!\n",
      "This place has a very unique feel. We nearly missed it on our walk to dinner  there's no real label on the corner restaurant.    They have an eccentric mix of IPA's and Pale Ales. The menu is very interesting as well  their buffalo wings and the cavetelli appetizer were both amazing..the cavetelli was served al dente with amazing flavor. I had the skate for my dinner  which was probably the most delicious fish I've had in as long as I can remember.   They are known for their burgers  which were very good as well. They are often compared to Village Whiskey's burger  and sadly I don't think they are quite on par  but still very good.  This place is on the pricier side  but the ambiance on a Saturday night is a mixed crowd  noisy and full of energy. Nicely done!\n",
      "There was a time when all i wanted to do was have an old fashioned at pub and kitchen  eat some meatloaf and take in my ipod playlist on the speakers.  It's changed considerably.  i don't know if the food quality dropped with the economy  but even their burgers are failing.  The only thing i recently had there with which i was impressed was sauteed swiss char with almonds and cranberries.  (It was really well cooked with no bitter and all the flavor  just like char is supposed to taste).  Their oysters are good if you're lucky enough to get there on a west coast day  but even then  they seem to get the small batches.   A real regret is that whatever bartender made me fall in love with the old fashioned has since wandered into a place of cheap watered down bourbon and cloying bitters.  A real shame for a bourbon cherry to go bad in a drink like that.   Oh  and who took the doughnuts?  Really?  Of all the dessert items  you took the homemade doughnuts with chocolate dipping sauce?  For shame! I'm hoping that as the winter rolls closer  we'll see the meatloaf again  with mushy peas  and mashed potatoes like a good simple urban hipster bar should class up.  For now  meh on all fronts except the neat interior and pretty awesome wait staff.\n",
      "Really like this place..Food isn't always the star of the show  but doesnt mean its not good..It really is. Good selection of beer  wine list is simple and good. But sets a great vibe that you can tell makes it everyones neighborhood joint. Always a fun time.\n",
      "This is my go-to neighborhood bar. The ambiance is awesome (I love all the cool retro lighting they have) the staff is friendly  and the food is solid. We typically like to go on the later side of the evening  around 10 or 11. At that hour  I don't see how you could have any issues with servers or food. What I really like about his place is that the menu is really seasonal. They always have something new and interesting to try. I particularly remember a really great  Arugula and Watermelon salad I had over the summer. Go and enjoy!\n",

      "i was looking forward to a new coffee spot  but this won't be it for me.  they dont have a menu first off  and im not a coffee connoisseur  so i was a little thrown off.  i kept it simple  asked for an iced tea  but they did give me hot tea w a cup of ice.  v. artsy crowd here  great for people watching  but not for studying.  its a little loud  my headphones were not enough to block out the noise  so i was stuck listening to watever they chose  which wasn't my preference.  the servers were all really nice  and they kept cleaning the tables quite often.  all in all it wasnt a bad experience  but not one to keep me coming back either...\n",
      "Yo this draft latte is BS good.   Also the guy at the register complimented my tie. 10 10\n",
      "Probably the best coffee shop I've ever been to. Everything they make is great. Their pure black and draft latte are the best iced coffee drinks I've ever had  full stop. Their drip and espresso are also very tasty and strong. If you are in the area and love coffee you need to stop by this spot.   Only complaint: the line can get absurdly long. However  the staff here is some of the best around and the line moves very quickly. On that note  service here is also very friendly.\n",

      "There's lots of contention about the Euro-snooty attitude of La Colombe's baristas.  They may have a point.  However  since I lived in Philly and now in DC  La Colombe's Niza roast has been about the only roast that takes me back to my childhood.  Whenever I come back to Philly to visit my BF  which is quite often  I end up buying a 5-lb bag of Niza roast  in beans  to use with my trusty Gaggia. I do my own grinding and the coffee is absolutely delicious.  Having said that  the baristas should attend the Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People  as well as read the old I'm OK You're OK trusty book.  Their attitude does need improvement fersure.\n",
      "Yes it a great place and great coffee. But none of these coffee places know how to serve a decent cup of black tea. I should say start with the tea leaves but I'll leave that alone. 1. The cup of tea is scalding hot 2. The tea has a burnt taste  So you need to lower the temperature  Then get to back to other things like tea leaves.\n",
      "$2 for a drip coffee. I had the Corsica blend  which is delicious. 50¢ refills  which is a nice deal if you plan on staying a bit to read or work. My first time here  and I'll definitely be back. Great prices in Rittenhouse for a good cup of Joe. Staff was friendly  line moved very fast. Highly recommended.\n",
      "My husband and I LOVE pure black from La Colombe  the best stuff on earth. After we had a problem with our online order we contacted them and they refunded our money and sent us free coffee! Great service  we will be customers for life.\n",
      "Staff was friendly  drinks were delicious  orders were fast and efficient  and prices are reasonable. Great place to grab a coffee!\n",
      "Delicious coffee and espresso drinks and a cute little cafe. If you come during the morning rush hour  be prepared to wait a while for your drink. There are a decent number of seats here  but again  if you come in the morning  you might feel a little uncomfortable with the people in line crowding your space. I am a big coffee drinker  so I like that their refills are 75 cents  if I remember correctly. The baristas are also very friendly.  My major problem with La Columbe is their lack of wifi. It's the 21st century  guys! It's a good place to hang out for a few hours with a friend or do some non-computer-requiring work  but the lack of wifi is seriously limiting.\n",
      "The staff's customer service was amazing. I don't don't think my water glass ever made it below half way filled. They were always right there and very attentive. My food was great  but my boyfriend said his side dish seemed to have been sitting under the hot lamp for awhile. They also wrote my name on my dessert for my birthday which was nice. I'd go back!\n",

      "Went there on a Friday night for our daughters 21st Birthday.  Well this is certainly a special occasion place but really could go there for a happy hour as well.  Wine and beer under 5 dollars to start at the bar which has nice seating area where you can relax.  The restaurant is beautiful classic downtown Philadelphia  high ceilings and columns bring out the old American charm.  Service was impeccable  when a plate was finished it wasn't more than a minute before it was whisked away by the staff.  Waitor was extremely friendly.  Menu is extensive.  Everything from homemade pasta to prime steaks.  The popovers that made up the bread basket were a delicious touch.  The crispy chicken livers were delicious  there was enough for a meal or two people.  This is a place I would strongly recommend and not just for a special occasion  but also when you just need to be served well in old Philadelphia style.\n",
      "Davios is the place I come to when I need to have the a true solid meal. Period. This is a place to feel at home and become relaxed after a long day.  When I come to the bar for a glass of wine I am greeted by IMO the best bartender in Philadelphia. He greets me with a smile that makes me wake up from the coma of life on a dreary winter day. His hello can make a monk come alive. Chuck will make you feel like this bar is yours .   I'm not getting into this appetizer or that entree because Davios is just a really nice place to take your date  friend  mom or dad for a meal that isn't going to dissapoint. They have terrific steaks and their pastas are very good  especially the angel hair  nice sauce slightly spicy and not too sweet like so many others.  They have a happy hour as so many do now with terrific pizza and eggrolls filled with steak and cheese .  And as far as service  well I've read the reviews and as far as I'm concerned the service has always been very good. If I need something I simply ask for it. It's not that big a deal to ask once. Twice is another story. This place has been on spot with service.  Never had to ask twice.  Food- 4stars- very good food-solid Ambiance-4.5stars- high ceilings  soft lights  golden walls-very lovely Service-4 stars-they're warm and friendly and not too stuffy\n",
      "Beautiful  elegant room with high ceilings and large windows. Good special occasion place.  Extensive menu with something for everyone. You can have a small meal or a long  multiple course meal.   The bread popovers were addictive. We had the fresh burrata salad and wished we'd ordered two!   All pastas are fresh and taste it. We had the 1/2 order of Truffle Mushroom Gnocchi and Three meat Carbonara. Both were outstanding. Incredible favor and light  fresh pasta.  Great wine list and knowledge servers but seemed understaffed or too many tables.  But don't get in a hurry. Plan on about 2 1/2 hours. We had a movie and didn't allow enough time.  Would recommend and return.  A man named AJ  was a real treat! He was so helpful and joyous. We enjoyed him very much.\n",
      "Ambiance is amazing  service impecable  kitchen sloppy.  Found an avocado stem in my tuna tartar and my creme brûlée was watery  bucatini amatriciana is average  lobster a tad over cooked.  Not going back. There's better food in Philadelphia.\n",
      "HORRIBLE. Where do I begin? We sat down and it took at least 5 minutes for someone to greet us. The staff was inattentive  rude and had no knowledge of the menu. The cocktail that I received was sugary that I might as well have ordered a soda because there was no taste of liquor whatsoever. The bread was not hot and the dips were watery. I ordered the filet mignon  thinking it would make up for the beginning of the dinner experience. It was overcooked  so the kitchen made me a new one. The manager who came over to our table with my new filet was plain rude. He had a British accent with no sincerity towards my guest and I. For dessert  I got the creme burlee  it was the only decent part of my experience at Davio's. If you want to go to a REAL Italian restaurant with a respectable staff and management  DON'T go there.\n",
      "Weather outside was extremely cold (no surprise this time of year) and was told the food in Davio's was good. It's located inside the Club Quarters hotel. I ordered the Fusilli w/ shrimp  pesto and pine nuts from room service.  It came quickly and was delivered by this delightfully quirky young man. He was in the hallway waiting while I was signing the check. While waiting he asked questions about my length of stay  where I was from  etc however when I answered he paced the hallway and would disappear when I was answering. Then he'd reappear in the doorway again. This happened a couple times. I think he was so full of energy he couldn't stay still. Funny thing is my co-worker got room service also and asked if it was delivered by the same man.  My pasta dish was just what I needed for the day! The pesto was more of a pesto cream sauce  fusilli done al dente (perfect). What can I say  can't go wrong with succulent shrimp...I was in comfort food heaven!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "This either is or isn't your kinda of place. Mostly I would say that depends on who is picking up the check   Service is impeccable  must have had 9 different people doing something at our table.  If you found it too troubling to scratch you own nose  I suspect they would have staff to do this for you.  The AMBIENCE is OPULENT.....that could be my whole review.  But on to the food.  (Spoiler alert: it's in you mouth for about 30 seconds and you're shitting it out about 24 hours later) It's very good...but worth this price??? Not to me.  The assorted spring roll app tasted like most other places. The fried calamari was again deep fried like every other place.  I had the veal( $38) it was good not memorable. The WINE list is EXTENSIVE and EXPENSIVE....that could be the rest of my review.  If ya wanna impress someone with a really swanky place and expensive food  yes this place is good. If ya got a little more game and you're savvy  you can do just as well elsewhere for a lot less.\n",

      "Bon Chon has decent food but it takes forever to come to your table. Each time we try to go  even when the restaurant is empty  it takes almost an hour to bring out our food (which is usually the Bon Chon Chicken and those are basically chicken fingers with a Korean flare). It is very frustrating so I suggest if you want any food here order it ahead and take out. I have a feeling that's why it takes so long when you're in the restaurant  they prioritize for the take out customers.   As for the food  I do recommend the Bon Chon Chicken Strips. They are flavorful and not over breaded. They have a great spicy kimchi mayo for dipping the chicken so ask for that. BEWARE: the \\spicy\\\" flavor is obnoxiously spicy. I don't mind but many of my friends decided not to eat it after a poor choice in flavor bc it was too intense for them.\"\n",
      "I lived in Korea for 2 hours and feel pretty confident in the accuracy of the following statements.   - It's atmosphere is authentic.  - The fried chicken is good but not 'addictive-good' as they claim.  - They have Korean beers and soju cocktails. Which is enough to keep me coming back.  - The bull dak is similar to one of my favorite Korean foods  dak galbi  but has made my butt sick both times after eating it.   I hope they fix whatever cheap ingredients are effecting the bull dak because the taste is there it should just come with a warning sign.\n",
      "The food is great. The service is extremely slow. Every time we go here  it takes average 55min to get food out. Sometimes one hour. No joke. If they tell you beforehand  at least you put enough coins for parking. Go to Cafe Soho to get almost same quality chicken and much quicker serve.\n",
      "Chicken was good  some pieces were over cooked  but the annoying thing was that they charged $2 for extra raddish. Yes it's just an additional $2  but if I spend that much on XL chicken  and additional dish and appetizers for 2 people  you would think they would just give me extra raddish. Maybe I'm spoiled by Korean restaurants where they freely refill side dishes  but it just detracted from the experience.\n",
      "I friggin love this place! Their chicken wings are great  fried light and crispy each and every time! You get your choice of soy garlic  spicy or half and half.  Aside from wings you could also get drums or strips served the same way...aside from great Korean fried chicken they also serve other great Korean appetizers and main dishes.  Another favorite of mine are the potstickers and the shrimp shumai.  They have a fully stocked bar and also offer Korean beers and they also keep yamakazi 12 yr Japanese whisky in stock too.  They close at 2 am and also offer a late night menu and drink specials as well.  The look and feel of the restaurant is very modern  they have huge flat screen tv's all over that play different ball games as well as tons of K-pop music videos. The place is small so when it's crowded they fill up quickly  great place to hangout with friends and the staff are all friendly and pretty attractive too\n",
      "My girlfriends and I decided to come here as we were craving KFC. We all live in the city so insead of the usual Cafe Soho  we decided to come here for convenience. We were greeted and there was no wait for a Sunday evening. The place has two floors with a bar  modern/hip space. Happy Hour menu was definitely tempting but we missed it and decided to just order from the regular menu.  We got a carafe of lychee soju - disappointed that we mostly just tasted juice. Takoyaki were good but nothing special. We ordered half & half of the spicy and soy wings. Although the wings were not greasy  crispy and meatier than Cafe Soho's  they were less flavorful. The food didn't take long to come out  unlike Cafe Soho. I would come back for convenience and speedy service but most definitely prefer the flavors of the wings at Soho.\n",
      "Came here around 11pm on a Saturday night and got seated pretty quickly. Staff was really nice and quick. We ordered the medium combo of drums and wings  salmon ball  and kimchi. All were spectacular! We did a spicy  honey garlic on the wings...the spicy was definitely spicy! Be careful! Would totally recommend this place. I love that they're open until 2am as well  the perfect place to end the night!\n",

      "Rangoon is a pretty good Burmese restaurant in Chinatown that I go to for lunch a lot because it is near work. When people ask me what \\Burmese\\\" cuisine is like  I say it's kind  of like a mix between Chinese and Thai. They have a great lunch special menu for around $7 that includes an soup or a salad  steamed or fried rice  and a main dish. I usually go for the Coconut Chicken Curry because it is creamy and has a yummy taste - very comforting - but today I switched it up and got the Chicken Basil which was also quite good and had a nice little kick to it. The service is usually pretty speedy  too  which helps when you need to be in and out in an hour. Overall  a solid little place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I just tried Rangoon for the first time ever - and all I can say is  why have I not been here before?  My partner and I shared the Burmese crispy tofu  which was no ordinary tofu triangle. A thin  crispy crust with tons of flavor revealed an almost creamy tofu inside - and the sauce was no generic \\orange fried appetizer sauce.\\\" It was full of flavor and delicious.  For entree  I got the spicy green beans with tofu - so good!!! Tons of fresh garlic and watch out for the sliced green and orange chili peppers  because they're in there. The sauce was super flavorful  and the green beans were sauted just right. The bowl of rice on the side was generous  and the rice was fluffy.  My partner got the curry chicken with coconut rice. After being initially surprised that the chicken wasn't in the uniformish cuts that it is in many run of the mill restaurants  she let me know that it was super tender and the flavors in the sauce were perfect. I don't eat meat so couldn't try it  but I did try her coconut rice and it was yummy.  I got a cup of jasmine tea for a dollar and loved it. Not bitter but warming and perfect on a cold day.  I definitely have a new favorite restaurant. The portions were great - we both cleaned our plates (though left rice behind). Not too much  not too little. Everything had tons of flavor  nothing tasted diluted by sugary sauces. Everyone was kind and I can't wait to go back!\"\n",
      "I love their grilled fish with red pepper  it tastes like Chinese food to some extent. The dessert is also good. A nice experience to have Burmese food which I was always curious about before!\n",
      "Had really nice flavors .But took way too long for the food to come.Terrible service.  Loved the calamari salad. Ordered seconds and they had forgotten the lemon. No one to ask as they were terribly understaffed.\n",
      "This place has some of the best food in the city- A MUST if you are in Chinatown... The service is great- the restuarant is very clean and well-taken care of  and they serve beer.  It's the food  however  that will keep you coming back for more.  My favorites are the thousand layer bread with vatana dip  the chili chicken  and the shan rice noodles.  They also do killer curries that I highly recommend.  We eat here (or get takeout) at least weekly.\n",
      "My dad and I came to Rangoon for dinner before an Eagles game. It hit a lot of things on my checklist - a varied menu appealing to meat eaters and vegans alike  close to public transport for the game  and a type of cuisine my dad would be unable to try otherwise.   The place was pretty crowded on a Sunday evening  and it took a little while for someone to take our order. However  once the food came  it was phenomenal. We started with the spring rolls  which were crispy and light  filled with veggies and tofu. There are a ton of vegan entree options  and I decided on the monsoon vegetables  which were really flavorful and well-cooked. However  I would have liked it to be a little spicier - the menu noted that this was a spicy dish  but even my sometimes sensitive tongue found this to be 100% mild.   My only complaint about the food is that the portions could be bigger for the price (especially a dish that is entirely vegetables)  but you leave the restaurant feeling satisfied.   I'd definitely come back to Rangoon  or recommend it to friends.\n",
      "It's been over a week since I went to Rangoon and I find myself still savoring the memories of the deliciousness we had on that Saturday afternoon.    This is my 1st time trying Burmese food and I wasn't sure what to expect  so we ordered the classic dishes: Asian tea leaf salad  thousand layer bread  festival fish soup  and jungle beef. The flavors are similar to Malaysian / Thai / Vietnamese.  There was a nutty  crunchy goodness to the Asian tea leaf salad that I couldn't quite pin point and it was uniquely Burmese though you must be okay with the idea of chewing a bit of tea leaf to enjoy this (it also contains peanuts and sesame).  None of the other dishes were overwhelming  everything was nicely balanced.    The staff were pleasant and efficient.  It's a big restaurant capable of handling large parties and they also had several tables for 2 (which is a plus).  We went before the dinner rush and had a very good meal.  I would definitely stop by again when I'm in Philly.\n",
      "I stopped by Rangoon on a recent work trip. I was dull and ordered the tea leaf salad and thousand layer bread based on reviews. The thousand layer bread is basically the Burmese version of roti canai  but made with coconut milk.  It was good  though a tad pricey compared to what I'm used to with roti canai.  The tea salad was a tad bland (though not bitter) and a few of the split peas were as hard as rocks. They seem a bit stingy on the tea leaves in contrast to some of the Bay Area restaurants. If I end up in this area again I would try some other dishes given the less interesting options in the neighborhood.\n",
      "JUNGLE CHICKEN  1000 LAYER BREAD AND A BEER. Very little to compare to  bread was good and food was filling  but I have never had Burmese food before... someone had to show me on Google Maps where Burma was.  Overall the food was great  but at $30 for one dinner (appetizer  dish and beer) - yikes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ice tea is excellent!  I was really disappointed with the service that I received. I had an hour wait for my appetizer. In addition my entre was incorrect but I coundnt find my waiter to make the correction never was I ask I was everything.... It's a shame because they have a lot of potential but with the service and lack of professionalism eventually if they don't take action they will lose out on a lot of revenue\n",

      "An ode* to Miss Tootsie's:  M - Macaroni and cheese is yummy and good!  So very cheesey! I -  It makes no sense how good that tea is! S - Super cool and attentive waitress (Alexis) - ask for her when you go! S -  Small space  so I wouldn't go on a weekend.  Week nights are good though.  T - The atmosphere is nice.  There are black and white photos of local Philly artists (Musiq  Kindred  Jaguar Wright  Jazmine Sullivan  etc.) on the walls. O - Oh my goodness  that tea is GOOD! O - Our orders came out piping hot...I even burned my tongue.  Totally my fault  though. T-  The waitress and I had a discussion about hot sauce.  In case you're interested  they use Crystal. S - Super cute take-home bags. I - I tried my friend's ribs  they were yummy! E - Everything was tasty! S - So yeah  I'll definitely go back - but not on a weekend.  Seriously though  I'd been wanting to go to Miss Tootsie's for a while  but I just hadn't gotten around to going.    I'm not gonna lie  this place is tiny  but now that you know it's small  you shouldn't be surprised.  The food was tasty  but not quite seasoned enough for my taste.  To be fair though  it is the week after Thanksgiving  and I've been eating my Mom's cooking for the past week.  Regardless of where you go  no soul food restaurant is gonna match Grandma's or Mom's cooking  but this place is good  and I'll definitely go back.  * So technically this isn't an ode....so what...shut up!  -)\n",
      "Southern Sangria is stronger than any European Sangria you've ever had. It's also more fruity  more flavorful and more maroon than any of that flimsy Spanish drink.  Prior to your meal  Ms. Tootsie serves up a giant cornbread muffin as big as your fist. Slather some strawberry honey butter on around the brown top and take a giant bite. The cornbread is as gold as the ripest corn and exudes a flavor akin to midwest state fair corn dunked in butter. It's moist  bountiful and hearty...just the way cornbread was intended to be...  The Chicken and Waffles is simply amazing. Usually not one for any sort of chicken  the buttermilk fry on these strips was too crispy  too clean  too golden not to gobble up. The waffles were fat and golden  and much like their tender counterparts  were smooth and moist on the inside. Served with pure syrup and any other requested condiments  this appetizer is enough for a meal.\n",
      "This place was amazing! Ms Reni made the most amazing drinks and had such an amazing personality and our waitress  Jiamond was fantastic. Her personality and attentiveness was out of this world. I will be back tomorrow for brunch!\n",
      "I really wanted to love this place  I really did. The staff was friendly  the decor and atmosphere was great. The food? Not so much. The corn bread which contained too much sugar as it is came with cinnamon butter I believe. I love sugar but I dont want to drown in it. Secondly  everything contained salt  I mean my goodness why? Really? why? The lobster mac and cheese even had obey seasoning on it. I felt like calling my doctor for a prescription of high blood pressure meds right then and there.   The cook had the nerve to come out and ask if I felt the love or could taste the love in the meal? If the love is salt  then yes I taste a whole lot of it.\n",
      "The food is wonderful but comes in small portions considering the bloated prices.    I had the okra and collard green sides  both of which tasted really good.  The fried chicken was very good as well but for $20 I got a tiny drum stick and smaller than average thigh piece.    The chicken pieces were so small they were more like quail pieces or perhaps hummingbird pieces.  The drum stick was more like a dwarf stick.  I'm exaggerating but you get the idea.  That is my gripe  give me more chicken in my main entrée.    The service was okay albeit a little disorganized.  My food took forever to arrive.    Very modern and well appointed interior.  The restaurant is clearly going for a cutting edge hip hop ambiance and succeeds to that end.    Ms. Tootsie's serves up tasty food but much sure you bring a full wallet if you want a full stomach.\n",
      "One of my favorite soul food restaurants. I had my 40th birthday party here last year and everything went perfectly from the arrangement and meetings with Mr. Parker to the night of my party. It was one that I'll never forget! I came here most recently with my coworker on a Friday evening and I'd had the Caesar salad with shrimp which was delicious. Tbh  I am usually sick of salads because I end up having to get one since I don't eat any real meats  but when I tell you this salad is the BOMB.com. It is sooooo tasty and filling. It's better than any Caesar salad that I've ever had. I had to cut each shrimp into three parts because hey were so big. My coworker had the buffalo shrimp and they looked delicious. We were both extremely satisfied and to top it off the chef came out to check on us and she was so pleasant. This was just another reason to come back  the ambiance  the food and the service was perfect!\n",
      "I went with high expectations.  They don't take reservations unless you're a party of 8 or more.  I had no idea that on a Wednesday at 6:15 there would be a 45- 55 min. wait.  Besides the bar area  which was full  there was nowhere to sit.  The upstairs waiting area only had a few spots- all taken.  Maybe it was an off night  but the food was just OK.  It was problematic that I don't eat meat.  Since all the green vegetables were cooked with turkey  I decided to order the caesar salad with grilled salmon.  Dressing was unremarkable and served on the side.  The crouton coverage was too heavy.  Might have been different if they were special in some way  but they tasted like they came out of a box.  The salmon portion was sizable- maybe 3/4 of a lb  but it was pretty tasteless.  Cornbread muffins were fresh and hot- decent tasting  though I would have ratcheted back the sugar.   I tried some of my friend's sweet potatoes.  They were OK.  She had shrimp and grits.  I also tried the grits.  Very bland  sprinkled with shredded cheese.    I rate them 3 stars because our waiter was very nice as was the hostess and other staff.  Speed of service was OK.  Atmosphere was nice.  My friend wanted dessert to go and asked after the check had already been prepared.  He brought the cake and didn't charge us.\n",
      "Good drinks  good vibe  nice view.  Been there a bunch of times -- yeah  I'm a fan. Great place for a romantic dinner or simply to start the night with friends. I can't really rate the food 'cause I haven't had an official meal there yet (only small bites)  but the service and the drinks are good -- some days better than others  but still acceptable. I like to sit on the balcony when it's warm out. It's a fun experience.  Definitely a fan of their restroom  too. It is clean and elegant  I like that! :)  Going there with a large crowd can be a pain though because the sitting is so...awkward. That's what I don't like about XIX. That  and that usually the people who go there are such snubs. Yikes.   But overall  it is a good place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been here a few times  once for dinner  once for Sunday brunch and another time just hanging out at the bar. I've enjoyed myself everytime! I've gotten the steak both times (dinner and brunch)...D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S. I also ate several slices of cheescake at brunch until I was completely stuffed. The service is alway great...I love this place.\n",
      "The decor and  view from this restaurant is absolutely gorgeous... A definite hot spot for a romantic dinner.  Food was cooked to perfection  service was exceptional - very courteous and prompt. I'll definitely be coming back!\n",
      "Excellent food  lovely ambiance  light and airy  not too noisy  with pleasant and attentive servers. But that's not all. The 3-course prix fixe lunch is my favorite. The first course is a buffet of salads  meats  and cheeses. Then you get a choice of entrees made to order. The arctic char with broccolini and couscous was delicious! Finally  a dessert buffet with a nice variety of small portion cakes  cookies  and mousses. I have been there for lunch many times and will return and recommend it to friends.\n",
      "I've ended up here twice within the last week with friends  and I have to say I'd forgotten how much I love it. For some reason I never remember to go to XIX - maybe because it's on the 19th floor of a hotel  or because it's in the middle of Broad St.  but regardless I have resolved to start going there more often.  The ambiance is spectacular - one of the most physically beautiful bar spaces in Philly I'd say  with that old hotel bar glamour that is harder and harder to find these days. High ceilings and windows  low light  a fireplace in the winter (which is reason to go there in and of itself) and gorgeous balcony seating in the summer...if you need a romantic and lavish date spot  this is your place.   There is a fairly good selection of wines  although they're categorized in a slightly odd way (e.g. full bodied  medium bodies  etc.)  that are not exorbitantly priced for a hotel bar. The calamari is also wonderful  although the cheese plate is a bit sparse for the price tag. It's also not too overcrowded or loud on Fri and Sat nights  which is a welcome respite from the midtown/Sansom St. craziness.\n",
      "Mice!!!!! Just left happy hour and saw a mouse running around the bar. Definitely not returning!!!\n",
      "I took my bf to celebrate his bday.  I opted to book via OpenTable-- seamless process.   We were running late (per usual) I called to inform the hostess and they were accommodating. The ambiance is to DIE for. The pearl chandelier is simply breathtaking.  After checking-in and admiring the architecture  we were seated. Our waitress (I forgot her name) was an ANGEL. She was very well versed on the menu and made meal and wine pairing suggestions. I opted for seafood and the beau ordered a steak-- heavenly! We had the last seating and not one did we feel rushed! Our waitress went over and beyond  she was very friendly and personable and helped in adding special touches (like lighting a candle when dessert came out). I also asked if we could take pictures on the balcony-- she said it was closed but she could see what she can do. Sure enough  at the end of dinner she opened the door for us to take pictures. The view was AMAZING. Our waitress was soooooooooooooo gracious.   I definitely recommend this place for a romantic dinner  wedding  rendez-vous--- whatever.   After dinner  we went to the lounge to order more drinks. You could honestly make a night out of just the lounge area.\n",
      "This is my first review on Yelp and sadly I have to give what used to be one of my very favorite happy hour spots one star. I have been coming to XIX for happy hour for years and I have always loved it. It has a relaxed vibe  its beautiful  and has great bar food. I went today to celebrate a friends birthday with a few drinks before venturing out into the city's nightlife and was greeted by a mouse in the lounge area! Totally unacceptable for a place of its caliber and reputation. Get an exterminator please!!!\n",
      "Good fries! Sit at the bar  comfy chairs and you can see the view of the city a little higher up than in the lounge. Happy hour is pretty good  the staff was attentive and the atmosphere is great!\n",

      "wm mulherins did not disappoint! Weve been wanting to come here for a while  and it was definitely worth the wait. From the intimate seating to the awesome music   we were happy from the beginning. Then we tried the food   and it was all delicious.  We started with the veal tar tar toast  ceviche   and octopus.  The tar tar was very unique and delicious. The ceviche was accompanied by grapefruit which we loved. Then I had a pasta dish and my husband had the halibut. We were given the option to add truffles to any of the pasta dishes for an extra 10 dollars  it was totally worth it and I highly recommend you do so! Everything was served as soon as it was ready  so all the food came out hot and fresh. The cocktails were great  but also had delicious wine. There is a log bar area with a few tables  where we actually sat and ate. There is outside seating with heat lamps. The vibe is really chill  yet the food is on another level. The experience is definitely worth the overall cost. We were not rushed either   everything was paced nicely. Will definitely be going back soon!\n",
      "Enjoyed a superb meal! Every dish was amazing. The food was always good here  but the new chef has taken it to another level. Especially good were the corn pizza  artichokes  corn ravioli  zucchini salad  and seafood mixto! The octopus was almost inedible the first time we ate here  overcooked and oversalted  this time it was fabulous! Terrific wines by the glass too. Even the bread is better than most. Excellent service as always. Will not hesitate to return or recommend this restaurant to friends and visitors!\n",
      "This place is a one and done' Had they printed the prices on their website  may have been a none and done. Hate to be the \\debbie downer\\\" but someone has to provide a dose of reality. Showed up without a reservation  and  having now experienced the place  am surprised we needed a reservation. Regardless  there were only tables out on the sidewalk (where the El passed overhead- nice touch every 10 minutes). This was fine as I did not call ahead. When we arrived there were a couple tables outside so figured out we could get seated quickly. Not so. \\\"They were not ready yet  why don't you have a drink at the bar\\\". After ordering a mixed drink and beer at $25 including tip  all of a sudden the tables were ready. I fell for this again  my bad. Lets cut to the chase  in addition to the bar tab  the \\\"dinner\\\" consisting of 1 beer  small plate of seafood mix  ribs ( at $9)  suckling pig  pasta and dessert with 1 coffee...$110 w tip. The \\\"suckling pig\\\" was a piece of pork  the volumetric size of a deck of cards (with good portion of fat) over beans  the mix was about 2 tablespoons full of seafood  the ribs were 3 small ones. The pork was $31. NOTE_ They tout this as a \\\"sharing:\\\" restaurant..How do you share 3 small ribs between 2 people? Don't go by the photos. If you get the camera close enough and use a small plate  it does look like you get a good portion. This place is for the \\\"uber generation\\\" who need to be seen. Personally  there a many places in the area offering better value to be \\\"seen in\\\". There are no drinks or food worth that money  $135 for 2 people. And if you want to spend a fortune just to \\\"be seen\\\" or name drop. spend it at Capital Grill or Ruth's Chris  at least you won't walk out hungry.\"\n",
      "Best dining experience I've had in Philadelphia  Loved the interior  food and staff was extremely friendly in a genuine way. Can't wait to go back.\n",

      "Great new place. Full house on Thursday night. All food was made perfect and service was on the spot Thanks stuff and chef Chris for a great experience\n",
      "Really great service and beautiful restaurant. Cocktails were also very good.   However  the food we ordered was lackluster in comparison. Very small portions for the raw plate and pasta. Hanger steak was tasteless. Pizza was worth getting.\n",
      "I was taken here for my birthday after wanting to go for a long time.  Everything was perfect  including the waitress  who explained everything  knew a lot about the menu and wine and had a voice that carried above the din in the room.  Standouts were the octopus  mouth watering  perfectly seasoned  and the dates  which I wouldn't have thought to order if not for reading about them beforehand.  They were off the charts  perhaps the highlight of the night.  WE had a pasta special and the duck  both superb.  I will be back soon.  I will be dreaming about that meal for a long time.\n",
      "I went for brunch on Saturday and it was so great I went back on Sunday! We had the asparagus salad seafood Mixto  mushroom pizza salmon toast volcano eggs pasta. Quite literally everything was delicious and perfectly executed. The asparagus salad was something I've never seen on any other menu. My favorite was the truffle pizza  rich and perfect. I can't wait to go back for dinner.\n",
      "Thoroughly disappointed that Barcelona Wine Bar \\lost\\\" the reservation my mom made (party of 4) for 7PM yesterday evening. When we arrived the place was absolutely mobbed  and we were barely able to walk in the door which instantly gave me a bad feeling.   The hostess was nice enough  at first  but as time passed it was obvious she was stressed/frazzled and couldn't handle the pressure/volume. Part of me felt bad for her the other part was so irritated. My mom and I tried helping the hostess look on the reservation sheet for our name however the penciled in writing was so haphazard and some even faded it was nearly impossible to read the names. The hostess offered to add us to the wait list which appeared to have several names already waiting  unfortunately she was \\\"unable to quote us a wait time\\\" which was insanely frustrating. I  previously worked in the food/beverage for quite some time  first as a hostess  as well as a server and bartender. Not once have I heard of not being able to quote your guests a wait time! Needless to say we left to eat elsewhere.  First they lose our reservation and the best they can do is put us on the wait list - without an estimated time? Totally bummed out  hopefully our next trip there (whenever that may be) will fare better. I advise calling at least a day or two in advance to confirm your reservation as they seem a bit unorganized.\"\n",
      "Nice fare - really enjoyed the cheese board  calamari  & bacon wrapped dates. Hanger steak was cooked perfectly. Portions were generous for tapas plating. The very reasonably priced full-bodied red blend we had was awesome & the dessert sherry our server suggested was excellent. Would recommend to anyone in town or visiting as a great experience all around.\n",
      "I went with friends here for dinner and we had a great time! The food was great  the wine was fantastic and the ambience was beautiful! Our waitress was friendly and took care of us on a super busy night! We were a group of six and ordered 5 different tapas which were portioned well. The ham croquettes were fantastic as was the butternut squash! We also did the chorizo with fig  the potatoes  and roasted carrots! They were all really good. We all had a hard time picking our favorite. We then shared the seafood paella which was flavorful!  We got there early enough to get one drink on the happy hour menu which I got the white sangria which I was very happy with. Everyone else enjoyed their drinks as well. We also shared a bottle of wine which our waitress helped us pick and it was perfect for our meal!   I most definitely will be returning when I'm home for visits!\n",
      "Had a 7:15 reservation  but when we arrived the host told us that the reservation got lost in their system. Waited at the bar for a half hr before checking back in with the host (who forgot who I was). Finally  45min later we were able to get a table. Would've been better without the wait or if they had offered to comp something  since the error was on their end. Two stars because the swordfish was delicious!\n",
      "We went before dinner for cocktails and some appetizers. We will absolutely be coming back. A+ service  cocktails  and tapas! We had a cheese plate (with drunken goat & blue cheese)  the swordfish  and the gnocchi with duck. Absolutely incredible!\n",
      "\n",
      "Loved this spot. After just visiting Barcelona in Spain and coming into this restaurant  I felt like I had returned with the atmosphere and all tapas. I recommend getting the pitcher of sangria about 3-4 glasses for a table of 3 couldn't get any better. We got the mussels  patatas bravas  pane con tomate all very delicious. This is definitely a must eat in Philly.\n",
      "This place is to Catalonian cuisine what the Olive Garden is to Tuscan cuisine (okay  it's not quite THAT bad  but it is a chain and with that comes some baggage).  We had heard a lot of great comments about this place  so we decided to check it out.  Our reservation was at 8:15 and when we arrived we were told that our table was not ready and that we should have a drink at the (extremely overcrowded) bar.  Because they have seating around the entirety of said (extremely overcrowded) bar  it was difficult to find a spot to actually order a drink  but after a few minutes I found an opening.  I ordered the Barcelona Gintonic and got the wife the Guns and Rosès.  Having had gintonics in Barcelona (the city) I had wrongfully assumed that they were going to serve me a similar style gintonic - a massive red wine glass of ice  gin  some tonic  and the remainder of the bottle of tonic served along side.  Instead it was a Barcelona the restaurant gintonic  which was served in a white wine glass about half full with a sprig of rosemary. Fine  not quite what I was hoping  but still a decent gin and tonic.  The wife's drink was much better.  It was lite and refreshing without being overly sweet.  We ended up having to wait an hour for our table  which i view as inexcusable if you have a reservation.  We ordered the croquettes  bacon wrapped dates  chorizo & figs  and pulpo tapas and the paella mariscos (which the waitress informed us would take 30 minutes). Croquettes - again  I was expecting something more like the Spanish croquetas you get in Barcelona the city  but these were Barcelona the restaurant's version.  They were balls instead of the slightly more cylindrical shape I was expecting and the balance of the ham and cheese was off (needed more ham). They weren't great  but they were pretty good. Chorizo and figs- interesting mix.  Again the balance seemed a bit off.  They could have scaled back a little on the figs and balsamic reduction.  Again  pretty good  but not great. Bacon wrapped dates - it's hard to screw up bacon wrapped dates.  They were good  but I have had better. In Philly. Pulpo - in Barcelona the city  this means \\octopus\\\".  In Barcelona the restaurant  this apparently means \\\"potatoes\\\".  This dish was a HUGE disappointment.  On the entire plate there were only a few tiny pieces of actual octopus compared to the remaining 95% which was potatoes.  Maybe in Barcelona the restaurant if you actually want octopus  you need to order the patatas bravas.  The table next to us had the same experience and I believe the ended up commenting to the waiter. Paella- we ended up waiting an hour for the paella  not 30 minutes.  The seafood was plentiful  but it tasted sandy and did not seem particularly fresh.  In Barcelona the city if there are prawns in paella they are cooked to perfection and the shell practically falls off.  At Barcelona the restaurant the prawns are cooked in a clever manner that seems to fuse the shell to the prawn  ensuring that you get your hands good and messy trying to clean them. My overall summary of Barcelona the restaurant is that if you are looking for a cool looking spot to hang out  socialize  and be seen  it is a great choice and probably the only place in this neighborhood fit for that purpose.  If you are looking for a place where you can get a table for 8 and try a bunch of different dishes  again  this is probably a good option.  If you want really good food  look elsewhere.  If you are looking for something on par with the restaurants in Barcelona the city  Barcelona the restaurant is NOT the place for you.\"\n",

      "Amazing lively ambience ..excellent service. Parking off the street (very difficult). Great food- veg paella needed some more veggies spicy eggplant delicious but not spicy at all and cocktails  ..loved the different tapas plates. Has few taverns  shooping stores and other restaurants around it.\n",
      "I'm very happy with the food  and most of all the service.  I ordered biscuits and gravy and was not happy with what came to the table  the server quickly fixed it and even the manager came out to apologize.  You can tell everyone cares.\n",
      "Great food  excellent surface. Many options  so try everything. I highly highly recommend the oysters!\n",
      "Love this spot! I've been here twice now  trying different dishes each time  and the food is consistently very good.   Food: get the fried chicken. Also  get the Mac and cheese. You can feel guilty about it later.   Atmosphere: cute and cozy with I've music. Just be warned that sitting near the musician means you won't be able to hear much of anything else.   Service: always prompt and courteous!\n",
      "I live in the area and am thrilled ot have live music 5 nights week.  We have eaten here for both brunch and dinner--both were very good  not standard bar fare at all.  They are reaching for gastropub and some of the menu hits it squarely .  The Onion Tart and Vegetarian Shephard's Pie  for instance.  Wonderful vibe inside.  And did we mention the live music...a juke joint on Headhouse Square...c'mon people  you gotta love THAT.\n",
      "We made reservations  and were seated upstairs about a foot from the band at a table that seemed more like a bar table. After sitting for 45 min with NO SERVICE  just empty glasses and silverware  we left. While leaving the host kindly insisted to grab the manager after we told her what happened. (The hosts were wonderful!)   The manager did nothing besides essentially say that this wasn't typical and to come back.\n",
      "Came here on Friday night for happy hour...great prices on drinks but the food was subpar this time. The fried green tomato Blt was very tasty...I will come back for brunch.   During winter months sit in the room on the opposite side of the door... Be prepared to wear your coat most of the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great music  AMAZING  most comprehensive bourbon list anywhere in the city  with the nicest  most knowledgable bar tenders ever.  I did not have a chance to eat there - we can later at night for drinks and the music (honky tonk   rockabilly amazingness).  I love the interior  total retro cowgirl.\n",
      "This place has the best wings ever and the fries totally rock.  We frequent this place and the food is consistently good and the servers couldn't be more friendly or helpful.  We highly recommend it for a fun casual atmosphere with great food.  Sherri and Steve Philadelphia\n",

      "Dope looking space inside!! Much cooler than expected. Especially on the 3rd floor with the ceiling windows  light fixtures and exposed brick walls.   We made a reservation (funny to me because it reminds me of a pizza shop... and like a reservation??... lol) But yeah  so we got seated on the third floor in the back and it was perfect. It was enough privacy although it got pretty packed pretty quickly after arriving.   Our waiter  Alex  was a mellow guy who'd crack a funny comment every so often.   Our starters were Mac and cheese and some bread stuff (I forget the name) lol. The Mac and cheese was much bigger than expected. We got two and we could have shared one. I was excited for it but honestly  it was blend and too creamy.   You also get complimentary tomato soup in these little cups and it was DELICIOUS. The tomato soup here is amazing. I'd highly suggest getting the meal. Cheers.   I got one of the burgers. It was good  not great but solid.   The staff seemed to sort of not look your way if you weren't their table. It was too noticeable for me. The staff could be friendlier.    Oh  they do valet parking if you call ahead. On Main Street  that's a MAJOR plus to take advantage of. We didn't lol and got caught in the pouring rain.   Would I come again? Yes. Maybe just on a cold rainy day for that amazing tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich. And also because the space is so cool and in the cut off Main Street.\n",
      "For my wife and I we are fans. I have noted some inconsistent pizza's as others have mentioned but nothing so awful that I would say they are bad. I have tried multiple pizza places in manayunk and I say they are about the same inconsistency. We both are pescetarian so we don't eat meat so I can't sing to that. I did take a star off because they have to improve in delivery and maybe lower the cost of the pizza. As for salads I think they do a perfect job  but again i think they can low price by .50 - 1 for most items. I do get the extra cost it seems to be a trendy place so you pay extra for that and happier and nicer staff.\n",
      "Really great to grab a bite for lunch (buffet style) when in a rush with work. Everyone gets to make their own plate of pizza  pasta  or salad. It really couldn't be an easier or more pleasant fast casual experience. Service is great--really friendly and attentive. I highly recommend this for a quick pizza group lunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A great place to stop in for an awesome meal! They pizza and salads are delicious  and you've got to try a Maddy bar for dessert. Don't pass up the tomato basil soup  it's to die for!\n",
      "The Couch Tomato is one of my favorite eateries in Manayunk  always good. Tonight I was disappointed in service. It's seems silly but I didn't like that I was dismissed by the hostess  cashier. I asked for my favorite salad of all time- Where's Waldorf. It always comes with poppyseed dressing. I got my salad and it came to me with a ranch style dressing on the side. I went to the girl and told her I got this other dressing and I'd like the poppyseed. She went to get it and said \\you have the poppyseed\\\"I told her no. I didn't have the poppyseed because is wasn't sweet and it was a totally different consistency then the other times I've gotten it ( about 100) and that I thought it was ranch or something like it. She then asked me if it had black specks in it. Yes  it did. Hands me the same flipping dressing I already had!! At this point I gave up. \\\" That's the poppyseed you have. Sometimes it's sweet sometimes it's not.\\\" No. Young lady you are wrong. So I didn't eat my salad. I took it home to eat with my poppyseed dressing AT HOME. Oh. And those black specks in the RANCH DRESSING you gave me? They are called herbs. Not poppyseeds. I just didn't appreciate it or her. And my salad was yummy. At home. With my own sweet  poppyseed dressing.\"\n",

      "after hearing all the rave reviews  i was looking forward to trying this place. im originally from ny so of course hearing that it had ny stylish pizzas and that their salads were great I decided to try it out. the first time i got a make your own salad and it wasnt bad at all. but it was nothing amazingly wonderful.  i thought maybe it was the fact taht id decided to make my own salad. so then i decided to order a pizza and salad again. i got the its not easy being green pizza on wheat crust and a salad. however  i was very disappointed with the pizza. i had it delivered and it was very soggy and chewy by the time i got it. the salad seemed ok. nothing amazing either.  and it also wasnt cheap so it was a bit disappointing. however  i know a lot of ppl love the place so i am willing to try it again. but i think i'll probably wait a while until i do again. im just skeptical since twice it didnt work out so great. hopefully as they say third times a charm.\n",
      "Mad Mex is the most casual restaurant of the Pittsburgh-based Big Burrito Restaurant Group. I first became familiar with the company and their stable of fine restaurants (Eleven  Kaya  Casbah  Soba  Umi  and  yes   Mad Mex)  when I took a job at Eleven while living in Pittsburgh. It was also my first experience with an abusive and plate-throwing chef  Executive Chef Derek Stevens.  My first Mad Mex experience came about five years ago in the University of Pittsburgh suburb of Oakland. Since then  I've dined at about half of their ten locations in State College  Pittsburgh and Columbus  Ohio.  For this review  I'm going to focus on Philadelphia's University City location  since that's where the majority of my visits have taken place in the last year.  Sandwiched between Drexel and UPenn.. Mad Mex clearly targets the college crowd not only with affordable and delicious \\Cali-Mex\\\" cuisine  but with an atmosphere that differs from your typical chain. There's no looped top 40 crap here.. they place a decent mix of alternative music. They expand beyond the usual Anheuser-Busch and Miller brewing company draft beers  and have an impressive array of craft and specialty brews on tap. They take the food here pretty serious as well  as the expansive eight page menu proves. While ambitious  everything I've ever had here has been excellent and quite affordable  too.   The big draw  though  what brings me back  are their put-you-on-your-ass Margaritas. Once you get past the music  the graffiti on the walls  and the young  boisterous crowd  the next thing to strike you may be their menu. Eight pages of every type of Cali-Mex food you can think of.. and then some. Don't get it twisted and think this place is a stuck up  high end pillar to fine dining. They certainly don't take themselves too seriously.. their lighthearted menu is full of corny little puns and funny names for entrees such as the \\\"Overtly Masculine Grilled Portabello with Foo-Foo Tofu Fajita\\\" which quips  \\\"Don't worry  ordering this won't make you straight\\\" and even a few risqué jokes if you look hard enough.  You HAVE to make an effort to make it here for Happy Hour  especially if you like Margaritas..  this is your spot. You have Raspberry  Mango  Peach  Lime  Watermelon  Strawberry  Kiwi  etc. During Happy Hour  you can have a gigantic 22oz \\\"Big Azz Margarita\\\" for $7.00 - instead of the usual price of $10.00. Margaritas aside  they have a killer selection of beer and tequila.. don't overlook the tequila tastings! Their selection may be the best in all of University City. For penny-pinching college students.. Mad Mex is hard to beat. Monday through Thursday from 2pm-4pm  there are several half price options for students  not to mention TWO happy hours every day of the week - the first from 4:30-6:30pm and the second is from 10pm-12am. As a little \\\"insider\\\" tip.. get the \\\"Little Butt Margarita\\\" during Happy Hour and get the \\\"Big Azz Margarita\\\" during non-happy hour times. That's the way to get the most bang for your buck  trust me.  As I said earlier  they have a thoroughly extensive menu and I've never had a bad dish here. They have five types of salsa and three types of freshly made dips  my favorites being the fire roasted tomato-chipotle and pineapple-habanero (HOT!) which are always served with locally made tortilla chips. A huge assortment of appetizers  soups/chillis  wings  salads  17 types of burritos  7 different enchiladas  chimichangas  quesadillas  fajitas  taco platters  and multiple desserts fill the 8 page menu . I've had the wings  chilli  4 or 5 different burritos  and my girlfriend loves the fajita platters here as well. I don't think you can make a bad choice if you tried.   As much as I love Mad Mex though  the staff can be surly  sometimes a bit rude when it's busy and service tends to be a bit slow (perhaps deliberately to generate more liquor sales..) and the later you go  the more raucous the crowd  but I guess that's par for the course. However  the fact that I can get silly drunk on 3 \\\"Big Azz Margaritas\\\" during Happy Hour for a really decent price  and enjoy some pretty good and unique Cal-Mex food is enough to bring me back time and again.. and I live two hours away!  Mad Mex has food that far exceeds the atmosphere and it's a don't-miss location for Happy Hour for myself and many other University City area locals. If you're in the area  and perhaps even if you're not  definitely check it out. It's inexpensive  inventive  and original. Thank me later.. I'll have a Strawberry-Kiwi Margarita  if you don't mind.\"\n",
      "Head over to Mad4Mex and get a Big-Azz marg during happy hour!   I never once went on a date at this place. But- I went there. A lot. I did research at UPenn/CHOP for 4 years and at the time Big-Azz Margs were served like 64 ounce slushies at Mad4Mex . That is how one takes the edge off at the end (or in the middle of) the day.   Now that I think of it- those happy hour \\Big-Azz\\\" margaritas were a powerful elixir. I've seen them transform people  places and things.   I do have a novel event to share from this venue: I recall a weekday evening when I went out for happy hour with a couple coworkers. We took advantage of the Big-Azz Margaritas and settled in for some laughs. Those margs can unlock secrets that no one would expect: after 2 drinks  one coworker ended up spilling the T about having been an escort back in the 90's and described unbelievable experiences and scenarios at length. Basically none of it involved illegal acts  just random requests- like sword fighting in lingerie with a Rittenhouse octogenarian.   Best Happy Hour Ever.   So head over to Mad4Mex and get a Big-Azz marg!\"\n",
      "A vile chain restaurant that I never want to come back to.  The fact that this place is so popular (and so packed) is something I find really depressing.  I feel like it's a sad statement on people's tastes--although admittedly most of the people who post good reviews are talking about the drink specials and not the food.  It seems there's more of a consensus that that this is more of a place to drink than eat  and I see complaints of poor service are also common.  I think the food here is pretty bad  and overpriced relative to the low quality.  I ordered a burrito and the meat seemed low quality  and the burrito itself was enormous but it was mostly stuffed with rice and beans  more rice than beans.  There was a sad excuse for \\pico de gallo\\\" which was cooked  and mostly tomato  a far fry from the fresh chunky salsa that any legit mexican restaurant would serve.  I seriously would have appreciated about half as much food  but higher quality ingredients.  The food was far too salty  yet too bland  and while it wasn't super dry  the meat (chicken) and burrito as a whole were a little dry.  I didn't finish my burrito and didn't take it home.  My girlfriend ordered a side of guacamole with her meal--mistake!!!  They charged $1.50 extra for it  and she said it wasn't any good and didn't touch it.  We're both guacamole lovers so in order for this to happen  it has to be pretty freaking bad.  Service was poor  and it wasn't just the waiter  although I think he could have been more attentive.  Our waiter came out once at the beginning  we ordered drinks (happy hour specials on beer--not bad specials)  then returned for us to order our food  and that was pretty much his involvement until he showed up with the check.  There was a miscommunication about the price (and size) of one of the beer specials  our server botched it.  At the end when we got the check  he eventually took it back and got it worked out with a small credit to our check.  So good job for fixing that one.  But other than that...my water ran out and the waiter never came back to refill it...he never came back to check on us and ask how our food was.  Oh  and when we first came in here the restaurant was out of glasses for water (of course  they weren't out of glasses for beer--why didn't they just use beer glasses?)  so it was a little while into our meal when they actually came out with water.  The atmosphere in here is very loud.  There was noise from conversation but also the music was turned way up.  I wasn't really crazy about the music.  The atmosphere was also dark  with a sort of cozy feel  but it didn't really do it for me.  It didn't feel homey.  Some bars feel lively  this one just felt noisy.  I think a difference for me is a lack of community feel...in this bar everyone is segregated off into their own tables and groups  so instead of like having a communal sociable atmosphere it's just a bunch of private groups whose noise is interfering on my space.  So I feel like I'm getting the bad aspects of the place being crowded without the benefits of it.  Something about the setup screams \\\"corporate bar\\\"  like the experience is being carefully manufactured by a business with the sole intention of making money.  I wouldn't come back here.  It's absolutely not my scene...not the sort of atmosphere I like  not the sort of food I like.  Like I said  I find it depressing how popular this place is...like it just screams that there are hordes and hordes of people out there who have really different taste from me.  I guess that's how life is  but...frankly I'd be happy to see this place taken off the map and replaced by something completely different.  2 stars and not one because they had some decent beers on tap  and because the food was edible and under $10  and I didn't get food poisoning or something...also because the waiter did correct the error.  But a part of me wants to give one star.  Either way  I'm never coming back  and I'll be praying that this place goes out of business.\"\n",
      "This place is a little hidden away  and took me and my friend a minute to find. However  Mad Mex has definitely lived up to all the expectations my friends set. The portions are gigantic  and their drinks are strong. I tried one of their burritos  which by the way are so big that I had to eat them with a fork and knife. The waffle fries are also delicious. I ordered a sangria which was pretty strong and delicious as well. Their food is so good  you will be thinking about it for a good while after you leave. I think I only ended up spending about $20 all together. However  it does tend to get loud  but I would expect that from a place in university city.\n",
      "I've been here many of times and I've never been disappointed. The food is good  the atmosphere is cool and the drinks are phenomenal. The service is exceptional as well\n",
      "The food is always fresh. Their waitresses are some of the best around. The one time I wasn't happy with my order  they fixed it so fast and were so sweet about it. Great place to go with friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-so-good: Service is slow and unresponsive What Mexican restaurant doesn't offer free chips and salsa??? Can't take people under 21 after 7 pm  Good: Portions are plentiful Tons of vegetarian vegan options!\n",
      "\n",
      "I like this place a lot. They just keep adding more and more vegan options! Everything I have had was amazing and the food is priced affordably. The only down side is picking the right time to come to avoid the college douchey-ness that ensues. If you don't mind being around a bunch of immature college kids  it probably won't bother you. I find that coming early on a weeknight is typically the best bet. Again  the vegan food choices are really great!\n",
      "\n",
      "With all the brick oven pizza places popping up in the city  you really have to have your A game on. The pizza here is OK. I wouldn't go out of my way for it. Toppings are generous and fresh. The crust just doesn't have enough bite for a brick oven pie. They are listed as \\personal sized\\\" but can feed two not really starving people.  Service was a delight and I enjoyed staring into the fiery pit. Dinner and a show!\"\n",
      "Best pizza in town  hands down. I'm from Italy and this is the kind of pizza you find in Naples.\n",
      "Stick with the pizza.  Craig Laban's review said that their pastas and calzone were extraordinary. They weren't.   But the pizza was very  very good and we would definitely come back for that.  Otherwise  great location  clean and spacious  and friendly staff.\n",
      "Delicious! Had the calamari and margarita pie  would definitely recommend giving Stella's a try!\n",
      "Service was great.  The food was so so.  I ordered Arancini(risotto balls) which had no flavor at all. The only redeeming grace was the tomato sauce.  Also ordered broccoli rabe appetizer  which I thought was cooked properly.  The pizza was AWFUL!!   Although the ingredients were fresh  the dough was very Undercooked.  It was burnt in some areas  and raw in others.  The bottom of the pizza was raw.  I looked around at other patrons  and the pizzas all looked the same.  This is Philadelphia.  There are better pizza places than this.\n",
      "I don't remember where I read it  but this was on one of those Top 10 lists for 2009  so we decided to check it out.  We got there at 5:10 pm and were told that there was a 45 minute wait.    There isn't really a bar area or waiting area  but they did take down our cell phone number and offered to call us when a table was free.  We walked the 1 block to South Street and we found a bar - Bridget Foys at 200 South Street - in which to have beers.  Had the restaurant had a bar  that is money we would have spent there.    We went to check in and found that our \\seats\\\" were at a bar-like area  where all three of us basically faced the kitchen and pizza oven.  Not the best way for people to have a conversation.  We waited 45 minutes for this?  We were told it would be another 20 minutes for a table.  So we took the counter.    We ordered a Sausage and a San Daniele pizza to split between the three of us.  It was more than enough  even though we were told that each pizza was a \\\"personal\\\" pizza.  We still had a few slices to take back.    The pizzas were very tasty...just the right spice of the sauce...and the Sausage had just the right kick.  The crust was fabulous  nicely thin and chewy outer crust.  The smokey flavor from the wood oven made these pizzas among the better pizzas I have ever had.    One great thing about our table  was the vantage point and watching the \\\"conveyor belt\\\" in which the pizza crew made the pizzas.  They were terribly efficient  each with their own task and passing it down to the next station to make each individual pie.    There was a lot of attention to detail and it appeared clear that they worked as a well oiled machine.  Definitely this place has a great system in place and a good pizza to share.  Definitely  this was worth checking out.\"\n",
      "Found it by accident. Gotta quote Bob Ross  \\We don't have mistakes  just happy little accidents\\\"   Planned on eating some where else  they were booked. Look at that  a pizzeria  with wine. Not what I planned on  but that sounds (and smells) pretty good. I am not obsessed with pizza like my wife is  but this was some of the best pizza I have ever had. It was just me  my wife  and my daughter  and we ordered 4 pizzas. They all come personal size so that's not too much food if I don't tell you that we also got two apps  and some pasta. Margherita(you know what that is right?)  Pepperoni  Mushroom(with ham and garlic crème)  & San Danielle ( prosciutto and arugula)  all delicious.    We sat at the bar  not what I usually do but  It's a pizzeria  not really a big difference at the table two feet from me. Service was good. Wine was surprisingly good. This place was a little more casual than I planned on dinning that night  but the cocktails and wines were top notch for sure. I read another review that said it was loud but  It's a pizza joint  not a library. Anyway I wasn't bothered by the noise.   The guys making the pizza are amazing. I timed them. One guy starts the dough  and by the time its ready to go to your table  only like four minutes later. I told the guy  you shouldn't get paid by the hour  you should ask for $1 a pizza  you'll be rich. But they're not just fast  they have like a dozen pizzas on the menu  and I feel like I have to go back for at least four of them.(Tartufo is at the top of my list)  Half the menu is white pizza  the other half is red  and the flavor combinations are excellent. Nothing too boring  nothing with an unnecessary overload of conflicting flavors  a few you already know  a few you are surprised to see but you know you have to try it  everything paired nicely.    And then gelato  I don't even remember the flavors. Something with salted caramel  something with coffee and chocolate  does it really matter? The drinks were awesome  The food was delicious  and the gelato that was so good I forgot what I even ordered.   I am defintely going back (I have like eight more pizzas I have to eat)  I only wish I'd found them sooner so that I could eat outside.\"\n",
      "Went here for the first time with 4 other people around 9PM on a Saturday.  The pizza menu was extensive and the crust was fantastic.  Our party as a whole preferred the white pizzas to the pizzas with red sauce. The special happened to be our favorite  which was a pizza with ground sausage and roasted eggplant and mozzarella.  Top that off with a couple of $12 carafes of house wine and it makes for a great evening.  The only negative of the night was the slow service  despite the restaurant being only half full.\n",
      "I wouldn't say there's something outstandingly special about Stella's. The vibe and location are great. The pizza was great BUT their gelato ice cream (I had Blackberry and Pistachio) was the best I have had in Philadelphia hands down. I'm a huge fan of gelato so this earns them 5 stars.\n",
      "Never been disappointed here  great brunch and dinner. Huevos Rancheros  and spicy Bloody Mary are great. Calamari is decent  honey chipotle wings amazing  crab cake sandwich among others are all good choices! Only wish they had a few more craft beer selections. Oh and of course the fresh baked breads are top notch :) One of the best spots in manayunk for sure.\n",
      "This is a great casual dining restaurant. If you want to be wowed and amazed then another restaurant my be for you  but if you want a sold casual dining restaurant then Winnie's is the place. The service is always great  and I like their food.  The menu doesn't change that much  but I have liked everything I have had on it.\n",
      "Just finished a horrible meal that started out great.  There were three of us and only one meal was edible.  The turkey burger looked like a meatloaf and while I like meatloaf not what I ordered.  When I questioned what was brought to me I was simply told it was made in-house.  Maybe something like \\We used dark meat turkey to make our turkey burgers\\\" would've helped.  But who knows maybe it was meatloaf.  No explanation either on the menu to say our turkey burgers look like hamburgers.  Secondly the hamburger ordered came out rare and not medium as asked.  Never really asked how is everything.  The Colorado chicken sandwich came out okay.  After the server started out attentive she then disappeared. The place was not busy so no excuse there.  When finished never asked how it was  if we wanted anything boxed up  the answer would've been no obviously.   All she wanted was payment on her IPad.  Really  really disappointing meal and service.  Expected better.\"\n",
      "Cane here for lunch and really enjoyed the food. I tried the lobster Mac and cheese and it was great. The waiter did an awesome job at making suggestions (he suggested the Mac and cheese) and I never had to wait for him to refill my drink. The place was nice and quiet with quality food  I'll definitely be visiting again.\n",
      "Somebody else already said it: you're not going to be impressed with this place. I'll just list some words that describe it below.  1) Mundane 2) Bad service 3) Lame menu  The food just isn't good. I recommend avoiding this place. You'll be disappointed  or at best full  but not pleased.\n",
      "Some friends recently took us here for breakfast during our visit to Philly.  It was really lovely!  We were seated at a shady table on the sidewalk outside where our friends could sit with their dog.  The cafe staff even brought out a bowl of water for her--very thoughtful.    Service was fast and friendly  and the food was tasty.  I had an omelet  which came with roasted potatoes and fruit on the side  and a mimosa.  The omelet was cooked just to my taste.  The mimosa was crisp and refreshing.  This was a great place to spend a relaxing weekend morning.\n",
      "Le Bus was always considered \\fancy\\\" when I lived in Manayunk in my 20s. The food was so good  but the prices were a little too high for our working girl budgets. My husband and I met our sister in law and brother in law there yesterday with two babies and two strollers in tow. We were seated outside  which was amazing and the food was just as good as I remembered. Actually  I think it was better! I had the brown nut salad and my husband had the turkey club. He is a turkey club junkie and loved this one. My salad was SO GOOD. Hummus  feta  quinoa  walnuts  olives and pita adorned my plate. I also loved the bread basket they started us with. Everyone at the table was very happy with their meals. I just loved that we could sit outside with strollers. Our (almost) four month old son was perfectly behaved. I think he loved the vibe of Le Bus  too  and could tell his parents were enjoying themselves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Great little place. Awesome sandwiches  a good drink selection  and some seriously-excellent fries. They're also dog-friendly and were happy to get my pup a bowl of water after our long day outside.\n",
      "this place was great! the food was yummy! the prices were fair. and yeah  the bread is top o the line. speaking of line - ull wait an hr for brunch. worth it.\n",
      "I love pizza. So much that I've tried most spots in the city of Philadelphia.  With that being said  this isn't the best pizza in America.  But i'm glad i tried it.\n",
      "Pizza is incredible! The low rating is due to the inconvience of this business not having a phone.  I really hated waiting around for my pizza to be made.    Also cash only.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decent  but nothing spectacular. Given the long wait  lack of phone  no comfortable seating  AND lack of credit card payment options  I'm tempted to give it two stars  but given all the five star ratings want this review to at least seem credible.   I am happy to see an attempt at quality being made. It is great to see quirky businesses in the fishtown area. That said. There are much better pizza places already here. Pizza brain is just one of them.   For those of you who do not believe me  go ahead  spend your whopping $20 plus dollars on a mini pie. Wait forever  and then consume something that makes you go  meh...   This place seems more hype than hip. More cold than cool  and more effort than it is worth. Just my two cents.\n",
      "This is an absolutely great pizza. It's hard to say anything else other than  wow. This is what pizza should be  and the atmosphere makes for a part of that  just a great place to go pick up a pizza and eat it anywhere. The fresh mozzarella is maybe the best that I've ever had  by far the best in Philly. The drizzled olive oil and gouda cheese on top are insane. My only  and I mean only concern is the price. No doubt that you need to pay up for serious pizza  but I think they could lower the price by just one or two dollars. You may say one or two dollars  that's not a big deal  but when buying a pizza it is. With that said  I def recommend at least giving this place a try because it is really good pizza.\n",
      "Meh.  Gimmicky.  Pretentious.  Overpriced.  Hipsters.  Pizza is good.  Not a value.  Poor service.  He creates his own demand.  In Philly  people are too smart.  Similar quality elsewhere at 2/3 the cost.  The staff are just weird.  And  despite what they think  they aren't cooler than me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The perfect rating for Pizzeria Beddia comes purely based on taste and quality. In order to understand the place  you must accept their unorthodox hours and long wait times. The pizza is in high demand  which is warranted  and that's why you must wait. I also respect the \\no delivery\\\" and \\\" no call in orders\\\" aspect of how they operate. It reflects on what you get in return...  You may find better traditional  Italian style pizza at a restaurant downtown  but in terms of American style pizza joints  this blows everything I've ever had away. Beddia offers a wide variety of toppings not seen in other corner pizzerias and gives an option of the arrabiata pizza  spicy but delicious.   If you don't live close by  probably not an ideal place to get pizza  but an absolute must try for Philadelphians and those visiting.\"\n",
      "3 Stars  A-OK  that sums it up pretty well. The pizza is without a doubt delicious  and probably deserves 5 stars  but this is a review of the entire experience. Best pizza in Philadelphia? Maybe  but debatable. I would advise that it's not worth breaking your back over  so if the stars align and you get the opportunity to snag one of these pies then definitely go for it. But don't book a hotel and a train ticket just for this particular Za.   I get the impression that most of these reviewers read the Bon Appetite article and are simply rehashing that message. It's a good article  so you might want to check that out.   At the end of the day you really can't fault the guys for running their restaurant their way  and whether their intentions were to create a marketing buzz or simply create great pizza  they've succeeded. However I think it's the marketing buzz that's driving that long line out front. There are plenty of other quality pizza shops in the region and most of them have a phone  deliver  and are always willing to sell you a pizza.\n",
      "One of the best pizzas  quite literally  in the world. Every pizza hand made by the owner from the very best ingredients possible. It simply doesn't get any better.   However  be prepared for the unique experience.  It's takeout only  and the wait can be 1-2 hours during rush. No phones. No delivery.   Whatever.   The fact that this place sells out every night is a testament to how good it is despite these limitations.   The people -- there are only two  a counter person and the owner -- are always very nice. I can only imagine the negative reviews are coming from divas and trolls who were expecting a traditional pizza joint. To you: Dominos is up the street.\n",
      "Good for a fast  reasonable and fresh meal. Kudos to using paper only recycled materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very nice and disappointing. Tried this new trendy place where a magnificent Restaraunt use to be. The decor is now for a younger more modern customer. Tasteful and sorta comfortable. Caesar salads were fresh  crisp and ok. Sides of Mac and cheese was terrific as were the Brussels sprouts. My friend told me his wild caught stripped bas was great. My experience with my main course was a disaster. The menu says \\pork chop bone in\\\". Great I love a pork chop if it's prepared the way I request it. I ask the waiter for his review of the \\\"pork chop\\\"  he tells me it's a crowd favorite. So I order it saying that I want it cooked so that there is no pink in the meat  not well done but no pink!  It arrives and I'm disappointed before I try it. It's not a chop but pork short ribs. I have never seen pork served this way before. As I cut  the fat is overpowering the meat  the flesh is undercooked and I almost gag on this hunk of meat. I request that it be cooked more to a medium level. In ten minutes it returns and the next bite is the same as the last. I'm now nauseated and have lost my appetite. The rest of the sprouts were great. We were comped a great chocolate desert and left. I'd return if a friend wanted to go but not my first  second or even my fifth choice.\"\n",
      "Please come for brunch!! We ordered the farmers egg and the French toast... sooo good! They have a homemade English muffin and it really taste good with the jam. The muffin reminds me of the Pizza Hut dough. So good. The French toast -- very delicious and fluffy  enough to split between two people. We are definitely going to come back for brunch again! We actually came here for Valentine's Day for dinner. Amazingggg the wagyu beef was phenomenal. Great place for date night and with kids. Very nice staff and great ambiance\n",
      "Was in town for business and Urban Farmer was recommended.  Not a typical red leatherette white tablecloth steakhouse  rather open modern restaurant.  Service was attentive  however the star here is the beef  particularly the dry aged steaks.  My steak was ordered medium rare and unfortunately was delivered medium to medium well.  However  due to the quality of the meat  it still delivered outstanding flavor.  To the restaurant's credit they did offer a replacement steak  but I was enjoying it as it was.  I can say that I will definitely be back on my next visit to the wonderful town of Philadelphia\n",
      "Amazing food and service. We stayed at The Logan Hotel and had breakfast at Urban Farmer since they had outdoor seating and we had our puppy with us  although they were technically not open outside they accommodated us and were extremely nice with our children and puppy. The food was beyond fresh and delicious  my daughter had waffles  and my husband and two boys had the farmer eggs everything was superb. Would definitely go there again.\n",
      "The food was absolutely amazing. I came for Saturday brunch  ordered the bone marrow  which is on their dinner menu  and they still let me order it. It was so delicious. The bones were full of meat and the bread was made perfect. They added a sauce to it  that made the flavor so enhanced. The fresh rosemary added a great touch.  Next I ordered the vegetable frittata. I was absolutely blown away. The mushrooms were delightful. They were large and flavored so well. Everything about this dish was so great. The homemade English muffins were like nothing I've ever had before.  I highly recommend this place. The staff was very attentive and made my experience here great! Keep it up Urban Farmer!\n",
      "The food was good and beautifully plated. My steak was overcooked  but I didn't want to wait for a new steak. Especially since they never brought out the salad I ordered and the drinks were super slow in coming out (beer on tap). Seemed like the majority of staff had never worked at a restaurant before  much less a high end one. Don't think I'll come back again anytime soon.\n",
      "Amazing service and staff. We were lucky enough to get a full tour of the kitchen  which by the way is incredible. The way they kept the meat fresh was perfect. Everything is so freshly kept and it's spotless. The cocktails were great along with the cheese plate. That guy knew his stuff!  Our waitress was so sweet. Very attentive but not overbearing. I love the atmosphere. It's warm and welcoming. Plenty of different areas to sit. The long wood table in the front is my favorite! So awesome.   I will definitely spread the word and go back!  Overall  amazing food  amazing drinks and amazing staff!\n",
      "Great food  service and facility.  Had gone for brunch with my husband and servings were generous and delicious. Burgers  French roasts d eggs were good.\n",
      "Honest Tom's is one of my fav places for Mexican food around Penn campus.  I am a vegetarian and I have tried their rice and bean  sweet potato burritos and tacos! I love the sweet potato tacos - the sweet potato pieces were fried n crispy  together with other veggies plus sauces the tacos were delightful! I would recommend splashing a little lime over the tacos because it was missing during my recent take-out. I like hot and spicy food and Honest Tom's has a good set of sauces to go with their food. I really like their spicy taco sauce and jalapeño sauces. Food's a little pricey  $6.50 for 2 tacos and ~$8 burritos..however the portion sizes are a little bigger than those in food trucks. I just have one complaint: they don't deliver anymore....sad because I would love to get their food delivered for meetings at work  oh well!\n",
      "Good tacos. The fish tacos are amazeballs but they aren't always on the menu. I wish they were. The burritos are also good and fairly priced. And the setting was great  very welcoming and comfortable. That staff was very friendly as well.\n",
      "5 stars just for the sweet potato burrito. It is definitely 2 meals in one  stuffed with flavorful ingredients. I especially appreciate the hefty portion of guac included. I want to try other things on the menu  but I can't help ordering the sweet potato burrito over and over because it is so good.\n",
      "Honest Tom's breakfast tacos are my FAVORITE breakfast. The prices are incredible for the amount of food you get. 2 tacos and a cup of coffee is the perfect amount for a good breakfast. Whenever family or friends come to visit us  we always make sure we take them to Tom's. When moving to Philadelphia this summer  I made sure my apartment would be walking distance!\n",
      "We live nearby and it's a little gem in our area. Been here a few times and the place is quaint and the staff is very friendly. Tacos are fabulous!  We have been to El Rey and I like Honest Tom's tacos just as much and for a slightly better price. They have the best fish tacos I've ever had. We usually get most if not all the tacos on the menu. We can easily walk or bike here but parking has not been an issue.  If you like tacos  you must come to this charming place!\n",
      "Tom's is fast and delicious! And they only have a few choices  which makes the decision-making easier.  I eat here regularly!\n",
      "I stopped in here for a burrito last month and it was excellent. Great ingredients  well spiced  and quick service too. The seating is a little cramped  but that's what I would expect for a small taco shop in university city.\n",
      "Absolutely no frills. Just some solid food  didn't really think the prices were bad. Got two steak tacos  were on fluffy corn tortillas which were pretty good sized. Nice amount of guac and pico de gallo. Also got a side of chips and guac. The guacamole is pretty solid  and they give a good amount of it. Like their chips. This isn't authentic Mexican food in taste  but I think they general spirit of the place feels like an authentic Mexican taqueria. Just put out some good simple food in a nice simple setting. Like that they have valentina salsa  maybe I missed it  but wish there were some cut up lemons.  Really like this place  wish I lived closer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I know what all the accolades  long lines in Clark Park is all about! Yup  I FINALLY got to try Honest Tom's. We would be walking in Clark Park and see the long line as we strolled through the Farmer's Market. I also recall reading a nice article a year or so ago in the City paper. So  when i read another article in City Paper that they opened up a store front  I definitely made it a goal on my new restaurant \\to do\\\" list! So  on this beautiful  spring evening  my friend suggested we try Honest Tom's.....  I ordered the Chicken tacos. my friend ordered beef Burrito. 1. Taco - the chicken was tender   moist and flavorful. I loved getting Guacamole on a meat taco. Yum! Tacos were very good and a good deal for $6. They use chicken breast and the pieces were big pieces not shredded  which is my preference.   2.  My friend liked her burrito  although she said the meat was a little bit greasy. The burrito was HUGE and was $8.00  The service was quick and friendly. They even sent my receipt to my email address.  FYI -  Tom said the truck will be be in action late March. Saturdays in Clark Park and M - F in the usual spot near Drexel.  We will be back again!!\"\n",
      "Thank you so much to Frank. After checking this place out on here i figured why not try them out. When my husband & I arrived we thought it was going to be a circus clearly you could tell the rush was over. We sat a the bar and that was by far the best decision  because we met Frank. Wow he is funny and ever  he popped my cherry with my first long island! Being a whisky girl i can honestly say this is the only place i will drink long island at. We order the Mac & Cheese which can usally be a bust depending on who makes it. We really enjoyed it  we order our with Crab on top. At must try if you like seafood. Everyone should stop here while in Philly\n",
      "\n",
      "After an absolutely awful experience at Continental Midtown earlier in the day  Varga Bar was a welcoming contrast in terms of service - quick  attentive  polite. Even though it is mostly a bar  mid-day meal there did not disappoint! My husband and I had a veggie plate  avocado salad with chicken and their famous delicious french fries. Easy  tasty break while touring Philadelphia. I definitely wouldn't mind eating there again!\n",
      "This may seem like only a partial review  but that's because we only had a partial meal. Nevertheless  our meal of appetizers and beer felt wholly satisfying thanks to the friendly and helpful staff at Varga. (Philly actors make the best waiters- they know how to act friendly and keep you entertained)  Our \\meal\\\" consisted of the following- Sliders  duck confit chicken wings  and lump crab cheese fries. The winner? The lump crab cheese fries. Even just typing it makes me hungry for them again.  A fine beer selection  I might add- a nice variety of styles and a staff that seems  to know their stuff.  We unfortunately couldn't try any of the actual meals or specials (though out waiter did a great job of selling them)  but they sounded great. A trip back to Varga is inevitable at this point.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I love a Varga pin-up girl  and a restaurant who dedicates their decor to them will always pique my interest. I stopped by one sunny summer afternoon on a bit of a solo date and parked myself at a nice street table for some prime people watching. The pickles fern fronds were firm and perfect  the bloody mary was extra spicy as directed  and the veggie burger was a very decent attempt at a house made burger - messy but tasty. I'll be back someday to try the famous mac & cheese!\n",
      "This place is SO over-hyped. Points for the fun  vintage  yuppie-posing-as-hipster vibe  but the food and drink were just okay.  To begin with  the wine list is severely lacking. Only one Riesling which was not my style but I never-the-less drank it because I didn't want to be difficult. I ordered the crab cake sandwich which was so salty it made my lips hurt! I'm also pretty sure it had been microwaved.... it had all the tale-tell signs: uneven heating and burn-your-mouth hot patches. Fun!  The crab cakes came with Old Bay fries. They were good (but added unneeded salt to an already saturated dish.) I was beside myself when they brought out their BBQ-sauce-posing-as-ketchup!! Thank goodness they had good old fashioned Heinz in the back! mmmmmm... anyway...  my boyfriend said his burger was just okay too. Lastly  the service was frustrating. Apparently some drama took our waitress away for quite a while... I had to flag down other waitresses several times.  Not a horrible experience  but this is Philly  people! Their are fantastic options galore! Unfortunately  this isn't one of them.\n",
      "Being a lover of both interesting beers and interesting food  Varga was right up my alley.  I had been to Varga once for drinks a few months ago and  after perusing the dinner menu then  knew I wanted to go back for dinner.  Fast forward a couple of months to this past weekend when some friends from D.C. came up to visit  we wanted a low key dinner before heading out on the town  so I suggested Varga.    The first thing I loved about this place  which I discovered when I was there a few months ago  is the beer selection.  There are multiple selections on tap for any type of beer lover  IPAs  stoudts  wheats  lagers.  Each beer is described to a tee on the beer menu so  say you're like me and love hoppy  piney IPAs but are sometimes disappointed when you order one that tastes like too much alcohol or wheat  you can choose a beer based on the flavors you like.  These guys know their beer and that alone makes it worth stopping by.  After we moved on to the dinner menu  we settled on the Truffled Mac & Cheese as our appetizer (I would've ordered some more apps  because they all sounded delicious  but we were going out afterward and didn't want to be too full).  What I loved most about this dish was how subtle the truffle and bacon flavors were.  Truffle and bacon can too often overpower the dish they are being used in  but that was not the case here.  The truffle flavor was nicely integrated into the cheese sauce (which was nice and light as well) and the bacon was limited to crispy pieces crumbled all over the top of the dish.  It was a great spin on your traditional mac & cheese.    For dinner  I ordered the Kobe Burger.  I'm not sure if the beef was actual Japanese Kobe or American kobe (I'm guessing the latter since it would've been more expensive otherwise)  but  regardless  it was a perfectly cooked (I ordered it medium)  melt in your mouth burger.  I did not find the cheese (cheddar I believe) or bacon to be too much.  My one minor complaint about the burger is that the roll was so soft and the burger was so juicy (that is not part of the complaint) that the roll got so mushy  I had to finish the burger with a knife and fork.  Also  I wasn't really a fan of the homemade ketchup  it tasted like a fruit that I couldn't quite place...and it was just too sweet for me.  The friends that I was with loved it though.    I can't really comment on any other entrees  one of my friends also got the burger (and had the same mushy roll problem)... my other friend got the hand made rigatoni  which I didn't taste.  He seemed to like it though.    The other thing I love about Varga is that it is very reasonably priced... between 3 of us we had one appetizer  3 entrees and 6 drinks (5 cocktails and one beer) and the bill was $100 (not including tip).  When I can walk out of a place with a full stomach and a good buzz for $40  I am happy.  Without drinks  it probably would've been half that.    I would highly recommend Varga to anyone who loves trying different beer and/or enjoys great food with a unique twist.   I am really looking forward to going back so I can try some other things from the menu (like the breakfast cereal ice cream and the ribs).  The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because I personally can't give any place 5 stars if I've only eaten there once.  If it's as good next time as it was this time  I'll be updating my rating to 5.  One last thing...we went around 9pm on a Friday night and there was about a half an hour wait.  However  you can also choose to sit at the communal table (a long table which seats about 8 or 10) in the front window if you don't want to wait.  We did that and had the whole table to ourselves for the 1.5 hours that we were there.  So  if you don't feel like waiting to be seated  it's not a bad choice.\n",
      "It took me a while to get to this place (an unfortunate naming issue with one of my ex-coworkers which I shan't get into)  It looks cool enough and I like all the outdoor seating.  A couple friends went the other day and enjoyed it so I tried it out as soon as a nice outdoor eating day came along.  Well - it was good. Not great.  And some things were just irksome.   First pickles - I love pickles.  We ordered the mixed pickle app.  I was super excited  but soon somewhat let down.  Don't serve mushy pickles!  that is not OK.  Some of the veggies were slightly unidentifiable  and the baby carrots were downright gross.  I ordered a watermelon margarita - it was just OK.  The one I made myself at home a day earlier tasted the same and didn't cost 8 dollars.  My GF ordered the hotdog - that was pretty tasty.  But the coleslaw  although it looked tasty  was not.  The mussels and clams were tasty  but why no spoon to eat the broth and really  just ONE piece of garlic bread?  That is just weird and cheap.  I had to ask for some more bread  which I finally got. But seriously the most annoying thing here is that they charge you for refills on soda.  Seriously - that cup of diet coke cost you like 3 cents  why charge us 2.50?!  For all you know you are screwing over someone's DD and that is just rude.   in all honesty I probably won't be back here.\n",
      "Varga is fine for a night when you want to sit outside. It happens to be close to my apartment which is why I go so often. The food is solid  outdoor seating with my dog is always available which is something I look for. The  service isn't spectacular depending on who you get..but all in all its OK in my book \n",
      "Every time I go to Beau Monde it's either raining or snowing or about to do one or the other  which is perfect because I like to pretend I'm dining in Paris instead of South Street and it makes the charade that much easier.  That said  my daughter and I sat in the lovely nook the day of the first snowfall of the season and dined on a ham & cheese crepe as well as one filled with strawberries and toasted coconut. The savory choice was good  but the sweet one was simply amazing. It was topped with whipped creme and was warm and gooey.   In addition to the extensive choices (I love to have it my way) they were also playing The Shins and Wilco  which earns an extra star. Yeah Beau Monde!\n",

      "Breakfast  lunch  dinner or dessert crepe - I have loved them all.  Love their Brittany style  square crepe made crispy with buckwheat flour.  The service is always friendly and being there in the winter with the fireplace roaring makes for a lovely date night.  I wish I could quit the bananas foster dessert crepe  but I can't or won't.\n",
      "Best crepes I've ever had. The a la carte menu is great  so many good options for making your own.  The House Suggestions are nice when you simply can't decide on your own.  Service was pleasant and fast.  Atmosphere is cute  romantic and french.  The best part is that you can either be very frugal by choosing veggies  or go all out and order the expensive stuff. Lots of variety.\n",
      "I have only been living in the area since September  but as of now this is by far my favorite restaurant. Have only been for dinner  and each time has been incredibly delicious. Ambiance is pretty cool  but if you don't get a window seat then you might be pressed for luck in the seating department.  This is a very minor issue  and the food more than makes up for it. Menu can be confusing to first timers. The top is a list of appetizers  which I always ignore. The middle is divided into two sections: dinner/savory crepes (yes  it's a crepery  but they do have a few regular entrees) and dessert/sweet crepes. They list ingredients (e.g. mushrooms  eggplant  chicken  mixed berries  nutella  ice cream)  of which you can make any combination. The bottom of the menu offers suggested combos (if you're overwhelmed by the options and are afraid to do the math involved  stick to the combos).If you're feeling creative  mix and match to make your own delicious crepe invention.  My recommendations: savory - chicken  mushroom  broccoli  goat cheese  scallops or shrimp  mushroom  broccoli  tomatoes (ask for mushroom sauce instead of seafood sauce) / sweet - nutella  mixed berries  vanilla ice cream  Service is fine  nothing extraordinary but doesn't detract. Can be pricey with drinks and multiple ingredients. Dinner for two (and dessert) is usually at least $50  and that's probably on the conservative side.  Enjoy!\n",
      "My sister and I went for dinner yesterday  it was very quiet. I guess this place is only popular for breakfast and brunch  dinner crepes are not as appealing. I got the ratatouille because of the Disney movie  it was kind of bland. The portions were not filling  we were still hungry afterwards. I would like to give this place another try  perhaps for brunch or something.\n",
      "Great decor and ambiance. I came here with a group  but definitely recommend it for a romantic night out. THe cheese plate appetizer was beautifully set up  Tried the chocolate crepe with coconut and coffee ice cream and it was flavorful without being too sweet. Next time I'd love to try one of their savory options!\n",
      "\n",
      "There's no doubt about it - the crepes here are delicious! The menu contains a wide variety of both sweet and savory crepes to match any taste  or you can pick from a full list of fresh ingredients and make your own. I tend toward sweet  so I ordered one with apples  almonds and honey - delicious!  My only caution is that  because it's so popular  the restaurant itself gets pretty loud. I was there with a group of 10  but I could only hear the people directly next to me. The service is also noticeably slow  again most likely due to the sheer number of other tables the staff attend to at this busy spot. I would have preferred a place where I could at least converse with the other members of my own party  but what can you do. Just prepare for a leisurely meal with a small group if you go!\n",
      "I spent a semester in Paris and got street crepes at least once a week  these do not even begin to compare. But we're in Philly so let's be reasonable.  I started going to this place in 2004 and it's been a go-to restaurant when I want something a little fancy and have the cash to splurge. Unfortunately  the prices have been substantially jacked up since 2004  so I don't go as often.  My usual is the mushrooms  swiss and toasted almonds crepe. Girlfriend gets the creamed spinach  chicken  tomato and swiss (chicken doesn't add much to the flavor so she gets it without when we're trying to be thrifty).  Both are tried and true and very delicious. The french onion soup is also very good.  If we have money and room in our bellies to spare  we usually split a sweet crepe. All the sweet crepes I've tried have been excellent  though my favorite is the classic Nutella Banana.  I've also had some bad crepes here. I thought the Shrimp  Spinach  Roasted Leeks & Seafood Sauce was much too fishy (and I like fish). Also be careful when you create your own - it's sometimes best to ask the waitress for a suggestion (they're usually very helpful).  I had the scallops  tomato and herb butter crepe last time. The scallops were overcooked and rubbery  I ate the rest but picked over what I paid $20 for. Luckily  when the waitress took my plate and saw that I clearly did not care for them  she said that she also thinks they're too well-done  and took the crepe off the bill completely.   All in all  Beau Monde is really nice for a date  the food is pretty reliably good (presentation is beautiful)  and the service is excellent.\n",
      "What can I say that others have not said? Not much but I can tell you this  This hotel was an excellent value for the $125 a night I paid to stay here. I am a native of Philadelphia however I was visiting the city for a wedding and did not want to stay with family.  I remember when this hotel was built but had no idea what it was really like until I stayed here. As soon as you pull in you have staff greeting you. The doormen  the bellman etc. I saw the check in desk was fairly large and just knew I was going to have to wait a long time to check in. That was not the case. I was called to the counter very fast. The agent asked for my name and id. She pulled up my reservation very quickly and gave me the information I needed for my room. She was polite  courteous and had a genuine smile the entire time.   My room was on the 15th floor. I had to actually travel through this large lobby to a set of elevators around the corner. Before I got to my room I noticed they had ice cream in a small freezer for guest at check in. How cute.  I eventually got to my room and was impressed. The pics speak for themselves. The room was a good size  super clean because I checked and saw nothing out of line and it smelled good. I was already in heaven. I had no time to sit down but I did enjoy that bed when I came back to my room that night. It was plush and I sure wished I had it at home.  I have nothing negative to share about this hotel. It was A-ok with me.\n",
      "One thing this hotel needs- updated food. Room service is mediocre and has been the same far too long. There really aren't any options for people trying to watch what they eat  or options to substitute.  And when I say update- I don't mean that awful Fresh Bites thing Marriott thinks is a good idea. It's wasteful and anything but fresh.  The food in the concierge lounge is usually decent  but at times it seems like they just throw out whatever they can find.  Again  keeping in mind that everyone doesn't want to eat pastries and pasta in heavy sauce everyday- salad and veggies are always a nice option.  Especially at breakfast.  I'm so tired of pastries and breads I can't eat and under-ripe fruit I won't eat. Recently was at a RI which had salad fixings on the breakfast bar  and surprise- it was the most popular item!  The staff here are always friendly and helpful.  Rooms could use a refresh. They are fine  but dated and a bit dark.  The restaurant is ok  but again  could use a refresh on the menu.   The doormen are always helpful and friendly. I just wish they didn't let people smoke right outside the door- it's kind of gross waiting for a cab with all that smoke.  However  when there are large groups in the hotel- particularly groups of young people in town for some sort of competition nearby  don't place your regular guests in the same area. We spent a horrible weekend among a bunch of rowdy kids running up and down the halls  screaming and yelling. When we complained the response was \\they have their own security.\\\"  That's not how you treat customers.\"\n",
      "LOCATION: Very central to the Reading Terminal Market  Hard Rock  Macy's and shopping.  LOBBY: Spacious area with a raised platform in the center with lounge seats & tables  and a restaurant off to one side.   ROOM: Nice and spacious. The bed was very comfy and the pillows were firm. I hate those normally soft ones where your head is pretty much level with the bed.  Cable was out for the entire night and next day.  The bathroom is spacious with 1 sink and a shower/tub with okay water pressure and a quick drain.   There was no parking in their garage  even for hotel guests.  There are several lots nearby which are priced a little less but the walk is farther.  SERVICE: Check in & out was fast and friendly. We didn't utilize any other hotel services.\n",
      "Beware  Bedbugs.  I'm covered in over 140 bed bug bites.  Stayed 5 nights.  Hotel sent a security guard to my room to write my name down upon my complaint to the manager and that is it.  A colleague at the same conference said wrong place to stay known to have bedbugs.  Long time Marriott customer with elite status and highly disappointed.  Reported to Health Department.  Similar complaints posted on trip advisor and bed bug registry.  Miserable experience.. know how to check your room or avoid location.\n",
      "Rating - 3.5 stars  I stayed at the Philadelphia Marriott Downtown while attending a conference at the convention center.  It's in a really convenient location (near restaurants  shopping  across from the Reading Terminal Market  walking distance to historical sites  etc.)  and there's an indoor walkway that connects directly to the convention center.  The lobby area is also really big and a good place to hang out with work colleagues.  The concierge is really big and well stocked.  Given all these plusses  I would rate the hotel a solid 4 stars.  However  I didn't have a 4-star stay because of the really  really loud construction noise on the street nearby that sounded like someone revving a motorcycle  dropping huge metal containers  and jackhammering throughout the whole night.  It was impossible to get a good night's sleep.  This was one of those times when I wished Philadelphia had a noise curfew.  The walls were also pretty thin  as I could hear the person in the room next door engaging in \\late night activities\\\".  Too bad an otherwise pleasant stay was tainted by such severe noise issues.\"\n",
      "Love this hotel. I just checked into Philadelphia today and I'm having a blast. I came on this trip alone knowing it was be a good one. I'm doing the tourist adventure thing. This hotel is huge from I see. Check in was simple and o did everything from my marriot app. I simply walked to the front desk and they asked for ID. By the way  they let me check in at 1:00pm. I didn't have to tote a suitcase around the city until 4pm. I also have a pretty awesome view from my room. Look at City Hall.\n",
      "Great location & very centrally located to everything in Philadelphia. Room was clean and quiet  and only $119 with the AAA rate!   Wifi is free if you are a member of Marriott rewards  which I joined immediately prior to staying here.\n",
      "Hotel is super conveniently located for everything you might want to do in Philly - a close walk to the museums  historical stuff  south street  etc. You really can't get a better location.   Room was affordable  parking wasn't too bad (considering it was valet and everything else in the area is similarly priced).  Room was super clean and the housekeeping staff was SUPER friendly.  The bed was really comfortable  the temperature control was spot on  and it was a great stay.\n",
      "The hotel itself looks nice  but once you head over to the rooms it looks pretty outdated. I wasn't very happy with the check in process  the guy who checked me in didn't explain that there are two towers  I was there for the auto show and would have liked to know that there was one tower closer to the convention center. I also have status and I'm usually offered water bottles when I check in  I had to ask him for water after seeing other people get them and he came back with just one because he ran out.   I had great service from the waitress at the bar  however  the food I ordered was mediocre. I ordered their seafood tater tots  which looked amazing on paper  but were lacking flavor.   The highlight of staying here was that I got to catch the Superbowl while I was there and they had tv projectors in the lobby  they also had free food/drinks at the concierge lounge  which was pretty great.   The location is great  near many restaurants and easy access to landmarks.\n",
      "As conference venues go  I have to say the Marriott Philadelphia Downtown is pretty crappy.  All the meeting rooms are too small  if you combine them together  you get a very long and narrow room that makes the people in the back feel like they're not even participating.  The ballroom is a pretty decent size  as is the exhibit hall  but the congregation areas on the 4th and 5th floors (outside those rooms) are ridiculously long and the escalators are inconvenient.  The main lobby has lots of great chairs - I even took a nap on one  since I'm staying with friends while attending this conference - but needs more outlets.  The restaurant (13) and bar (Circ) are jaw-droppingly overpriced.  $9.50 for a vodka diet? $6 for a tiny bit of hummus?  Seriously?  And the wifi...I didn't even bother.  $13 PER DAY for non-hotel guests.  I've heard rumors that the parking is $45/day but I've been using public lots and garages instead  there are a million around.  The Starbucks in the lobby is priced normally and has lots of seating.  The official conference center is convenient to get to from inside.  Reading Terminal Market is right across the street for lunch  but you'll have to go elsewhere for dinner because it closes at 6pm.  I'll be back next year for another conference and I'll be staying in a room that time  so I'll definitely update my review then.\n",
      "I recently had the pre fixe meal for $22 and I enjoyed the combination of tastes on my plate. The chicken was moist my veggies were tasty but a little too greasy....overall is was a great meal.   I also use them for take out/delivery. I have always enjoyed the way the package their food  in plastic containers that I use over and over again until they look too worn out and I recycle them. I hate take out places that use so much boxes and cups and card board - it's extremely eco-unfriendly.   The food here is never spectacular but is a good standby you will always come away enjoying. The prices seem a little steep but the restaurant atmosphere is contemporary  the service has always been splendid and the food is dependable.\n",
      "Great atmosphere  service was very friendly and prices were very reasonable however I found the food a bit bland  not bad just bland. My husband and I were starving after a long drive to Philly and this filled the spot but it wasn't overly enjoyable and we most likely won't be back.\n",
      "Really disappointed. I've been to the Marathon at 18/Spruce and had excellent service  drinks and food. Thought that would transfer to this location - not at all.  To sum it up  our server was extremely energetic  but not in a good way. More like a frantic energy. I was there to enjoy a few drinks and dinner with a friend who was visiting (AKA looking to spend money AKA you will get a larger tip if you let us stay longer) and we were rushed out. Server brought boxes for food we were still eating  without asking if we wanted them. A few minutes later he physically put the food in the boxes at the tableside while mumbling something like \\I don't like food sitting on the table.\\\" .....we didn't even want to take it home. Next  when we said we were having another friend join for another round or two of drinks he told us we couldn't stay at the booth we were at and we needed to go to the bar. What? I point blank asked him if he was kicking us out of the booth and he said \\\"yes!\\\" energetically. There was no one waiting for tables and there were numerous open tables/booths around the restaurant. I felt extremely uncomfortable and wanted to leave immediately. Our friend joined after all this happened  and when the server came over to ask if they wanted a drink  he seemed surprised when we told him we were just going to leave. YOU LITERALLY just told us we couldn't sit at this table any longer!! We then left.  I worked in restaurants for a long time and I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to restaurant service. I was not pleased at all during this visit.  On another note  the food was not that great.\"\n",
      "I like their salads  tea  and french fries! The servers were great...I've been here a few times and I'd come back!\n",
      "Sandwiches are great here!  They have a decent menu with a variety of food types. Lunch time gets crowded  but that's downtown Philly.  The jambalaya was tasty and just the right amount of kick.  I'd definitely go back.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember when this was the place - many moons ago. Now  though the portions are large  the menu is dated. Not a bad place to grab a quick bite  but I'm uncertain whether I'd linger.\n",
      "Straight to the point: the service  the one dish I ordered and the inside was very inviting  my hamburger was made perfectly like I like it. The restaurant is really nice and they have good drinks.. No complaints\n",
      "We consider Marathon to be Philly's diner. Yummy comfort food at a good price. Tonight  sweetheart loved the matzo ball soup  which is 5-star. I really enjoyed the turkey plate with mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce.  Sweetheart's salmon salad had a lot of yummy ingredients  but the salmon was a bit dry. Marathon is a perfect go-to spot for basic foods that I could make at home  if I cared to cook!\n",
      "All over good food. Not super fancy  but I have never had something there that I did not like.   Recommended items:   Marathon Burger Basil Lemonade (alcoholic) Dark and Stormy (alcoholic) Vegetarian Chili (awesome!!) Fire-roasted salsa Crispy Buffalo Chicken Sandwich Southwest Salad  Great place to get a decently priced meal and is easy to get into any day of the week.\n",

      "Love  love  love this little spot!! I came here not knowing what to expect. First  once you enter  you'll need to walk over to the back to make your order. And then  once you make your order  they make the tacos in front of you while you wait. I'm not the most knowledgable in regards to Mexican tacos  but I felt like the folks over there were very patient and hospitable. They explained everything to me. Once I got my food  I was asked to sit down. From there  they asked me for my drink order and asked if I wanted some soup. I got the shredded pork taco  and the shredded lamb taco. Those were the options for the day. I also had the fresh honeydew drink and some soup. Wow!!!  The food was fresh and amazing!!!!  I never had a taco that fresh!!!! But the star was actually the soup!!!!  The soup was a work of art!!!!  So tasty!!!!!\n",
      "Amazing tacos and tortas! Even the bread for the tortas is homemade. The owners were very welcoming and offered us samples all of their homemade agua frescas. I think we ended up having one of everything on the menu  including a delicious rice pudding for dessert. You can't beat the quality of food and the quality of service  this really is one of the best restaurants in Philadelphia.   I do believe they have early hours  so save your appetite for a big lunch or early dinner.\n",
      "Omg. Just come. The menu is not expansive. Hope you like lamb carnitas today because that's what they have. But you do like carnitas. Trust me on this. Some of the best I have EVER had - and I've had plenty. They sell them for $60/kilo  or $4 for a taco's worth  and I'm watching order after order of both sizes  walk out the door.  I don't do 5 stars lightly. I'm stuck at wow!\n",
      "\n",
      "The reviews and hype is real.  I don't need to explain to you any further  please go and try for yourself it will be a life changing experience.\n",
      "the lamb was incredibly gamey  my wife nearly puked. I felt the same getting a whiff as i was eating but not so averse. However  receiving a very bland cafe de olla was very disappointing. It was like a watered down Maxwell house with a hint of orange  sugar  and spice. Nothing like I had had elsewhere  or even here once before. If your out  your out...plain and simple don't slap together a monstrosity  I'll come back as long as what I get is good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't let the weekend-only hours deter you from one of the best eating experiences in the city.   The mosaic-ed facade  of what appears to be a 'home turned restaurant'  will let you know you have arrived.   Walk in the door  and a man with a cleaver is waving you to come sample his tacos. No hostess  no menu  just an excited man with goat oils all over his hands.   Walk to the back  almost into the kitchen. Trust him. Trust everything he tells you. He will guide you to the land of meat and tortilla.   He may force feed you a sample of the glistening meat on the chopping block. You can't even attempt to say no.   After you are impressed with his flavors  he will ask you if you'd like more tacos. When you inevitably say yes  he will chop off more hunks of meat  ball the meat in his well lubricated hands  place them in a tortilla  and serve them to you with a proud smile. There is a \\register\\\" by the chopping block  where you will eventually pay. This is also where you get your fresh OJ or horchata (there's no booze). He will insist on eating right away and worrying about paying later.   The tacos are wonderful- maybe the best I've had in Philly- but the attitude of the place is what makes this a spot to definitely check out. It's laid back  everyone's happy and proud of the product  and it feels like everyone is welcome. Families and old people  young people  visitors from Norway  locals  everyone just sits and eats at the colorful tables.   Very pleased  I will be back.\"\n",

      "I can eat A LOT  as in: \\try-to-hide-the-piles-of-food-in-front-of-me\\\" a lot. And these platters make me look like I have a modicum of restraint. I don't recall ever running out of anything on the plate before I ran out of falafel. There were so many falafels they had to bring the rest out on a separate plate. Everything was scrumptious (I had the Mama's Platter)  made better by the pickle bar to add some zest and spicy goodness to my food pile. Bonus moment: taking some leftovers home...all for $10.\"\n",
      "I went there for the \\best sandwich\\\" today  but the whole experience was a disappointment. There was a ridiculously amount of hot sauce and was very unevenly spread  almost cried when I ate at the end. And honestly  the sandwich tasted very fair in general in regardless of the excessive hot sauce. I probably won't go there again  I've had better falafel sandwiches in Philly... Overrated place.  btw... It's cash only.   日妈老子遭辣惨了\"\n",
      "Great place with fantastic  traditional Mediterranean for a ridiculously low price. Bring cash and stop in on several occasions if you can. I already plan on it being my lunch spot again tomorrow!\n",

      "I'm surprised i haven't reviewed this place yet! I'm here for lunch at minimum once a week! I usually get the half (or whole) falafel sandwich and carrot juice. Their falafel is some of the best in the city-crispy on the outside and soft mushy on the inside. Sooo good!\n",
      "dead man walking on the island... a last meal... granny's sweet potato pie  diet mt dew and falafel from mama's. there's no doubt that it's the best in the city of philadelphia. reviews aren't necessary for mama's.\n",
      "I love Mama's so much.  The half falafel sandwich is my go to lunch at a mere $3.50  and the whole is only $6.  The eggplant is necessary when a whole sandwhich is in order.  And they have amazing soups during the winter  like lentil  mushroom & barley  white bean  & spleat pea.  A cup of soup and a pita is only $3.50.  Then the guys behind the counter are the greatest.  My non-vegetarian husband loves this place as well and is a stop in our regular eating places.  When you're extra hungry  the fries are remarkably good.    Overall  this place is crucial.  If you haven't been yet  order a \\half on whole wheat  spicy.\\\"  You won't be disappointed.   Don't forget it is cash only!\"\n",
      "I arrived at 20th and Ludlow intending to try to Octopus Falafel Truck but wound up at Mama's Vegetarian instead - talk about a fortuitous turn of events! I used a friend and fellow yelper's review to decide on what to order. The Mama is really the perfect sandwich - whole wheat pita lined with hummus and stuffed to the brim with 5 falafels  tomato  cucumber  cabbage  hot sauce and tahini. The pita is soft and doughy (the best I've had)  the falafel crispy on the outside but still super moist and flavorful  and the cucumber and tomatoes fresh and simple - the perfect complement. I'm a meat fiend so I consider it a real feat when I don't miss or even notice its absence in a meal  and Mama's delivered. I also ordered the grapeleaves and fries. I've had better grapeleaves  but the fries were legit - steaming hot  glistening with oil  and that fresh potato taste (clearly just out of the fryer). The service is fast and all the individual components of the food are done really well here. I'll definitely be back  just needs that extra WOW factor for the fifth star.  Tip: CASH ONLY!\n",
      "If Mama's could open up inside of an Ikea-cum-Target-cum-consignment store  I'd never have to leave home again!    The hummus is top notch. The falafel is cooked perfectly  it snaps in your mouth as you bite into it. The pickled veggies have just enough taste so as not to overwhelm your tastebuds.   And the Jew in me feels like it was a \\mitzvah\\\" to eat quality  kosher food.   If someone could prepare food like this for me everyday  I'd give up the cow in a heartbeat\"\n",
      "Oh Chickie's and Pete's  you are the perfect place to watch some sports and indulge.   No doubt this is not the best food I've ever had but  if you can get a seat  grab some beer with mussels red and crab fries  there's no way not to thoroughly enjoy this place during a game or any time you're down by the stadiums.   My favs are the crab fries  mussels red (white is overloaded with garlic that I can't always take it)  the spicy pull and peel shrimp  steamers  and if the mood is right the blue crabs (it's a lot of work but tasty). This place also makes getting down and dirty with your food easy. There are sinks all over so you can rinse the mess off your hands once you're done....good touch.  To sum it up  Chickie's and Pete's is a Philadelphia institution and always a good time. I strongly suggest going at least once to enjoy the experience.   Please note: Make sure to remember two things before coming during major sporting events. 1. You'll never get a table and 2. You'll deal with a ton of drunk people. I've absolutely been one of these people before and we can get annoying unless you're in the right frame of mind. :)\n",
      "3.5 stars.  Chickie's and Pete's is a friendly sports bar  particularly for women  and it has lots of seating for Sunday games. I appreciate the sound booth in the sky  as it means that (admittedly bad) music is played during the commercials  along with special themes for Eagles fans. And  the place seems to be smoke free.  But  I am not impressed by the famous crab fries  which are crinkled  lightly fried  and seasoned with garlic  chili pepper  and salt. Something about the congealed cheese sauce detracts from the entire experience  and I also prefer my fries to be piping hot. However  there are towers of beer available (complete with taps)  which is pleasantly tacky.   With loads of space  booming sound  cute servers  and rowdy fans  Chickie's and Pete's is a perfect place to catch a game.\n",
      "So far a two  its been a while since Ive been here went to a Phillies game with my nephew had to feed the kid  aitting waiting on fries and the smell from the carpet is turning my stomach currently 10:37\n",
      "I've been wanting to hit this place for quite some time. Today seemed perfect for lunch. I had the classic cheese steak with crab fries. The cheese steak was quite good  tender tasty slices of steak and a warm cheesy sauce on a delicious roll. The crab fries came out hot and crispy and perfectly seasoned. The service was prompt and attentive which I liked. Very clean and a very nice sports atmosphere. I will be back.\n",
      "I've gone back and forth with giving this place 4 or 5 stars  I am settling with 4 only because of the pain in the tail service we had when we first arrived.  I was told by all my Philly friends that I had to go here for crab fries when I was town.  Friday night during the Phillies game we went to Chickie's and Pete's  we were immediately seated at a two top table.  While delivering our beers and crab fries  the server asked us if we were ready to order.  We explained that we would be there for the game and we were pacing ourselves and her response was \\the whole game  well you better be constantly ordering if you are going to take up my table.\\\"  I totally understand her concern  and we assured her that we would in fact be ordering beers and food throughout the game.  A few moments later she walked through her section complaining and cussing about the $1.00 tip she received from her table  again  I understand her concern  but there is a time and a place.  She then cleared a table and came to take the order of the people next to us  and placed the dirty plate of shrimp peels on the table  gross.  While our beers sat empty she sat down a few tables near us and had a 10 minute conversation with her friends that were dining there.  Another table sat down and again we heard the same speech about not talking up her tables and that they had to order all night (glad it wasn't just us).  At this point  our beers had been empty for 20 minutes.    My friend went over to the bar  found 2 empty chairs and I asked her for our check.  She knew we had planned to stay all night and asked why we were leaving  and I was happy to tell her that we were not going to take up her table.  Our check was $14.00 and I left $24.00 hoping that she would take that act of kindness and extend it to the poor patrons who had to deal with her next.  Now.... Onto the experience at the bar... TOTALLY AMAZING.  The bar staff that was working on Friday 4/19/13 made our night.  They were friendly  informative  suggested what yumminess to order on the menu!  Over all  those 4 gentlemen negated the unfortunate experience on the other side of the restaurant.    The food by the way... the crab fries... yum'tastic!  My friend ordered the \\\"red\\\" mussels and I had the \\\"bleu\\\" mussels.  I feel like we ate all night long and never put a dent in them.  Absolutely amazing.  If I am ever back in Philly... I will 100% be visiting the bar at Chickie's and Pete's!!\"\n",
      "5 stars  as far as sports bars go. Awesome atmosphere with tons of TVs  high ceilings which allows for huge projectors to show games  great service  prices and food. For my gluten free eaters  the tortilla chips and fries are both gluten free. They also use a separate fryer from their breaded goods  so no cross contamination! Try the Buffalo Chicken nachos... the chicken is grilled  so no worries there. It is covered in cheese sauce and bleu cheese  too. I opted for extra buffalo sauce for more balance between hot and cheesy. I got the bacon cheeseburger with no bun  which was made from high quality sirloin. It was incredibly good! Their mixed drinks didn't skimp on the alcohol either. High recommended. Can't wait to go back!\n",
      "Been here a couple of times and it's never bad. Crab fries are always a good choice  but I think they might want to try to remake the cheese so that it doesn't harden so quickly for dipping. Awesome sports bar for the guys and the place is always packed. I love the atmosphere.   Can't ever go wrong with their huge portions of mussels for such a good price! Got the chickie's riverboat clams before  not really worth the money and they were okay. chicken parm sandwich is alright. The magooby sounds weird (contains shrimp  pickles  fries  onions  cheese)  but it was actually a very interesting combo and i liked it. the lobster cheesesteak is alright (lol doesn't really taste different from the regular cheeseteaks though)  will be back from time to time!\n",
      "After a 4 year hiatus from Philly  I returned last night for a business trip  Chickie's & Pete's was a perfect place for a welcome back dinner.  Living in Seattle  we eat plenty of crab and seafood  so I immediately went for things we can't  get in the Pacific Northwest  which included 4 pints of Yuengling's  crab fries (fries with a wicked cheese crab sauce)  a cheesesteak  and lots of sports (witness the Sonics move to Oklahoma).  OK  this doesn't have quite the neighborhood charms of some of the classic Philly joints  but it sure is spacious  clean  efficient  and tasty.\n",
      "A favorite!!!  Always a good time and always enjoy great food from  the crab fries to wings to mussels to pizza.....all outstanding!   Personal favorites of mine are the buffalo wings  mussels white   crab legs  and of course the crab fries!\n",
      "Fun place. The game room has for different groups  golf  boxing  rock n roll  etc.. Pick your game and enjoy with family & friends. Great seafood  awesome drinks  can't go wrong coming here.\n",
      "Sooooo great!  I would have ranked it 5 stars but my husband said his was only ok  but he might have been expecting more from the hype  including the Prez Obama photo posted.   Back to me  I loved it.  I recommend the Franklin  it has Philadelphia cream cheese and regular cheese.  I'll ask for extra onions and mushrooms next time because I like my food loaded.  Note of caution  the line gets long and as every sandwich is made to order  it takes a long time.    The guy who took the order was very funny and made me smile after a 40+ min wait.  One day left in philly  pretty sure I'm going back here.\n",
      "I generally prefer the hoagies here  but decided to try the Philly Cheesesteak this weekend.  The stand in the Reading Terminal has the working class Philadelphia vibe.I wish they would serve fries or something else with the sandwich.  I had the Classic Cheesesteak  and they offered all kinds of toppings.  The sandwich was very good  but certainly not in the class of Pat's or the big name places that Philadelphia is known for.  Still if you visit Carmen's you will not be disappointed.\n",
      "Not impressed.  I just paid $20 for two smaller sized sandwiches.  There is definitely not enough filling in these to make it worthwhile.  I ordered a turkey hoagie with NO lettuce and extra mayo.  I got NO onion and barely any mayo.  Not a big deal  but when you have your mouth set on something and you pay $10+ for it  you want what you ordered.  There are definitely better places to get a hoagie.\n",
      "I first heard about Carmen's is located in Reading Terminal Market because it had been voted as having one of the best Italian hoagies in the city so I had to try it. I went here after lunch hours in the early afternoon and it was still crowded. The guy who took my order was really nice and made good suggestions to my sandwich. The Italian hoagie was really good  maybe not the best in Philly but still good. Meat was tender and a good portion and the bread was pretty soft too. I look forward to trying the cheesesteaks here.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had jury duty in the area and decided to kill some time in Reading Terminal for lunch. I did several loops of indecision until I decided to follow in the steps of President Obama and order a cheesesteak at Carmen's.  I waited in line for almost an hour and thanked God every time someone gave up and exited the line. I'll admit there were moments I almost exited myself because my lunch break was concluding and I was worried I wouldn't even have a chance to eat the sandwich once paid for. However truth be told  I consumed that sandwich in under 5 minutes because it was THAT good.  I don't care that I was sitting in a room full of civilians with steak juices running down my arms when they called out my juror number - I was in heaven.\n",
      "Carmen's is a Philly staple and a top recommendation for any out of towners looking for a great hoagie or cheesesteak.  When working in Reading Terminal Market I was able to make friends with two of the workers who also were direct descendants of the owners. I love that Carmen's is still a family owned business in the city.  The hoagies at Carmen's are truly some of the best I've ever had in the city. It's no wonder why one of the most popular food tours in the city samples their Italian hoagie and Cheese hoagie. My personal favorite is the Italian hoagie (and I'm usually not even a fan of Italian meats)! The bread is delicious and they really pile on the meat and cheeses.   The cheesesteaks are absolutely delicious and are mountains above some of the other Philly \\staples\\\" like Pats  Geno's and Jims. My favorite is the chicken cheesesteak with grilled sweet peppers  mayo and sharp provolone. It's worth the 5 pounds you'll gain afterwards.  The staff is friendly and their trademark is giving a playing card matched to your order. If you're visiting the Philly or a local in the area  I'd definitely stop by and treat yourself to a one-of-a-kind hoagie.\"\n",
      "The line was pretty long even on a saturday around 5ish. It was like half hour before closing time. The price of the cheese steak was expensive. Like 11 bucks for a cheese steak. But if you ask me if it is worth it  Nope.  I'll prob wont be a repeat visitor. There are so many different cheese steak places that have better quality and more reasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know about the food  but the service is terrible. I was running late for my bus back home  and rushed to this place for a taste of hoagies. I pleaded the lady there to speed up  but was declined out of \\other people are also rushing up for their trains etc\\\" too. She definitely showed no sympathy for her customers. What's more  it appeared that she did not speed up  or even slowed down  by put three tomato slices over a hoagie for more than one and a half minute. My trip to Philly had been perfect  but this event made my last memory of the city aweful.\"\n",
      "Very authentic and prices are reasonable. Naomi tofu is made with silken tofu and extra spicy. Soup dumplings are fresh and delicious. Don't be fooled by the location next to the Chinatown bus station  it's amazing food. We get it here every time we visits\n",
      "Fried pork soup dumpling is the best  and the pork pocket is also delicious. Good rendition of mapo tofu and pork with sauce noodles. Bok choy is also really good. Not as refined as some other dim sum gardens but really who cares. The taste is what counts.\n",
      "fast and efficient. the hot and sour soup was spicy and flavorful but too loaded with bamboo shoots (I don't know  maybe that's the authentic version). the Shanghai pork steamed dumplings were incredibly tasty. when you bite into one it literally explodes with juicy flavor in your mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't like to write negative reviews but Philadelphia Magazine recently named Tom's soup dumplings Best of Philly  and I think a retort is needed. These XLB are different from the ones previously served at this location   and have a thin  biteless broth that cannot rival the savory pouches at Dim Sum Garden. The dumpling sauce does nothing to improve the taste  and probably makes it worse. I eat soup dumplings at least once weekly  and cannot in good conscience eat here when DSG is around the corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was ok.  Its right next to the Wawa and Greyhound bus station.  They had a variety of juicy buns and they had bubble tea.  It actually wasn't cheap.  Each dish was $5-7 for the dim sum.  And they didn't have shumai or beef noodles.  They noted that they were Shanghai style only  no Cantonese.\n",
      "Was in the mood for some Ramen in Philly but i could not find anything. I walked by this place and was like hey let me try. I can say food was excellent. I had the for appertizer shrimp dumpling...perfect. The food came out quick  shrimp fried rice and scallion pancakes. I recommend trying.  The staff was great.\n",
      "Wow - when you first get in there is a huge line  but it moves very quickly. The food was AMAZING though the resturant is load and crowded. Was such a fun night out. I would recomend bringing friends to share the food with. Reminder: this place does not have carts - you do arder of the menu. Best items: bok choy  soup dumplings  moon cakes\n",
      "We ordered takeout dim sum this week. It's great! The prices were very reasonable and the dim sum was pretty good for those prices. It's not the most flavorful we've had  but definitely better than your average chinese food  and the prices/selection put it as a must try.  I recommend any noodle or noodle soup dish with their handmade noodles (so good) and the scallion pancakes as must gets.\n",
      "I moved from Chicago to Philadelphia over a year ago.  Everybody here raves about the restaurants  but I have yet to find many that deserve five stars  or even four.  This is the best restaurant I have eaten in in Philadelphia.    Tahini and bread  arrived at the table  and I thought  hum  plain but I'm hungry.  They must put crack in that Tahini.  I wanted to lap it out of the bowl like an uncouth dog.  The bread is excellent too.  I love a menu with many organic meat choices.  How often can you order an organic beef shishkabob?  It was superb.  The meat done perfectly  the onions nearly caramelized but not quite so they still had some substantive crunch.  The purslane salad tasted like I was eating a plant in the middle of a garden.  It is not often that I dream about a salad but I do dream about this one  My husband had a chicken dish with black eyed peas and green peas and fantastic rice.  I won't begin to describe the flavoring  it is beyond my culinary vocabulary.  We asked what spices they use  and in addition to traditional zatar  they use their own blend of spices.  I don't even need to know what is in it just so long as we can keep coming back and ordering it again and again.  I was so full but ate dessert none the less  which I usually don't do.  But when a diner is this good  I had a feeling the desserts would be too and I just needed to find out.  Pistachio creme brulee.  It could have come out over the top  but no indeed.  It was pure pistachio heaven in s super light yet rich custard.  Heaven. Heaven.  Our service was superb.  The squeezed us into a last minute Friday night reservation with the caveat that we would need to get through our dinner in an hour and 15 minutes in order to accommodate a reservation made prior to us.  Given the time constraints they never made us feel rushed and timed the meal perfectly.  Then my husband left to go to the restroom  the waiter picked up his napkin and refolded it nicely on the table.  Do I care about the napkin placement in the middle of a meal?  Not really  but it is a sign that the waitstaff is incredibly attentive and extremely well trained.    My eating out plan for Philly might just be to skip eating most everywhere most of the time so I can frequent this expensive  though appropriately priced restaurant.  Kudos to the chef.\n",
      "I normally wouldn't think Greek food for brunch or lunch  I'm way more of a traditional American-style brunch kind of guy.  But when my friends suggested to meet them here for brunch this past weekend  I trusted their better judgement.  In the end  I'm glad I did.  This cozy Center City spot not only serves an amazing (and dare I say  a contender for the best) brunch in Philly  the staff really make you feel at home.  They really know how to wow their patrons: fresh food  delightful presentation  and so many delicious sounding choices it's hard to choose which dish you want from their one page menu for mains.  Their specialty  and they're not shy to tell you  is the Cyprus Breakfast.  It's a mediterranean twist on the classic combination of eggs  meat  and starch.  The plate comes out with two sunny-side up eggs  fried in olive oil and garnished with fresh parsely.  It's served alongside a grilled slice of lounza (Greek ham)  two pieces of salty  crisp fried halloumi  warm bread  and tomato  cucumber  and onion salad.  The menu also features a spread of other traditional Greek  Mediterranean  and Middle Eastern specialities: Avgolemono  Moussaka  Pastitsio  Shaksouka  and Malohwa to name a few.  They even serve Greek Coffee and Frappes!  The service may be a little over-attentive in an attempt to make you feel more than welcome  but it's much appreciated  especially when other restaurants fail to put as much effort into the service as they do the food.  One other tip: reservations are highly recommended  if not required.  Because of Kanella's small space  getting a table at brunch is nearly impossible if you're not on the list.  But if you can score seats here for brunch  then expect nothing less than a stellar way to start your weekend morning (or recover from last night's activities).  Can't wait to come back and try out the dinner menu.\n",
      "I'm dying to try the Sunday night 14 course \\meze\\\" for $35 sometime soon! The food is fantastic and it's BYOB so you can bring a fantastic bottle of wine you can actually afford. Specials are always inventive and delicious! The atmosphere is bustling yet cozy. You can't go wrong with the Cyprus breakfast--eggs  halloumi  and ham! I had amazing duck egg with a spicy yogurt and merguez sausage for my birthday brunch a few years ago which I still crave. The grilled octopus is awesome  but my favorite may be the \\\"manti\\\" which are spicy lamb dumplings! If the dips of the day include the pumpkin-feta dip definitely order it! It's amazing. Their baklava and cardamom ice cream are heavenly. Whenever I walk by and see people on the street enjoying their meals and wine  the corner is so inviting! I also love to inspect the quirky decor and handwritten signs. These are just the things that make Kanella uniquely special.\"\n",
      "I haven't had too much Greek food in my life (other than your typical gyros). I have been to Athens though...and had pretty good food there (really good lambs  street-gyros  and a lot of mythos beer).  Eating at this restaurant on a hot  humid summer day brought me back to my trip to Athens  except that I didn't have the view of greek ruins lit up at night  those narrow winding streets  or bottles of mythos on my table (it's a BYOB).  But the food did bring me back to my memories in Greece. We had the dips  moussaka  rabbit  and lamb. I can't say anything bad about them. However  the meal wasn't spectacular...it just didn't have that extra flare for me to give that last star (then again  I'm a big food snob). I would recommend the place to anyone looking for Greek cuisine  and I would definitely recommend coming here during summer and getting a seat outdoor.\n",
      "Great for lunch! Our meals were hearty  tasty  and affordable (most entrees priced around $10).  I had the Hummus Plate which came with 4 falafels  pita bread  and greek salad. But the real star was the Greek Chicken Soup that my husband ordered. The broth reminded me of a creamy Thai soup because it's infused with lemon flavor. Half the customers in the restaurant ordered this and I would definitely go back for seconds!  Can't wait to try dinner at Kanella  especially since Kelly W. says the fish is out of this world.\n",
      "This tiny Mediterranean spot on the corner of 10th and Spruce may not look like too much from the outside  but once you step inside  the experience is sure to blow you away. I've been here twice but both were absolutely incredible dining experiences. Both times I visited were during brunch hours so my reviews will be based on that menu.   My first bit of advice is  if you haven't been before and want to know what to order  the answer is the Cyprus Breakfast. This meal  and it is quite filling  has everything you could want for a brunch. Two extra crispy fried eggs  a big slab of ham  two pieces of a fried Mediterranean cheese  some delicious bread and a salad  all together on one glorious plate. My fiancé and I both ordered each time we went because it is that good!  This past trip  I also ordered the lamb sandwich  which was also amazing. Large chunks of lamb and lots of fresh herbs on a soft roll.  Another menu item I'm dying to try is the rabbit soup that was on special. The way it looked on the table next to me had me wishing there was room left in my stomach. For dessert the answer is the galaktoboureko. I know this is a complicated word but if you just the gala they'll know what you mean. It's a warm rich custard with a layer of crispy phyllo dough on the top and bottom  drizzled in orange infused syrup. It's outstanding.   Kanella is special because of more than just the food. They have an amazing staff. We had the same young waiter both times we went. He was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Usually you don't remember the waiter and if you do  it's never for good reasons. The service here actually enhances the experience. On top of that  there was a family with an elderly man in a wheel chair coming to dine here while we were eating. I saw the chef (who I believe is also the owner) leave the kitchen  go outside and help the man in through a back entrance and actually wheel him all the way up to his seat at the table. Honestly  this was really touching to see.   I couldn't recommend Kanella more highly. I will be back again soon!\n",
      "\n",
      "Kanella had excellent appetizers!  i would recommend the watermelon salad  the rabbit and duck sausage  the three dips and the boureki!   The decor is nice and it feels truly greek  but the noise levels are pretty high.\n",
      "Dined there a bit ago and can only remember truly delicious things about this restaurant. Everything that I tried and ordered was beyond my expectations and blew me away.  BYOB  perfect atmosphere  and the chef  Konstantinos came out and introduced himself. Very personable man.  Overall  I'd definitely recommend this restaurant for making you feel at home in a Greek/Cypriot house when you are eating.\n",
      "Absolutely charming breakfast  brunch  and dinner spot. Happened it while in Philly for a conference and actually considered extending my stay just to explore their menu fully.  Food is elegant but has a warm  home cooked feel  coffee is strong  and the ambiance is great.  Gotta love a spot whose servers shout \\Opa\\\" when a guest breaks a glass!\"\n",
      "I haven't eaten here yet  but love the beer selection and the drink called the pain killer with OJ  pineapple  rum and rum chatta.  YUM!\n",
      "Best place in all of Manayunk. Great food  great beer  and a friendly staff. Burgers and Dogs are the best in all of philly  and they have a great brunch menu as well. If you haven't tried this place  do yourself a favor and visit their Manayunk or Queen Village locations.\n",
      "Been living around here for two years now. This place is easily one of my favorites bars in the whole city. Staff  food  and beer is great.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not as bad as I feared it would be. It takes a lot for me to venture into a manayunk bar on a Saturday night. Imagine my surprise that the bartenders were actually cool. The patrons were ehh -- I later found out st joes kids returned to school the same night I was at lucky's.  The first floor was a bit narrow leading me to feel a bump each time someone moved past  but eventually I was able to sit at a two top and relax  people watch  whatever.  I look forward to returning on a low key evening -- non weekend night  and maybe trying some grub.\n",
      "My boyfriend  roommate and I checked this place out the first week it opened. Since then  there hasn't been a week we haven't stopped multiple times. The staff and management are welcoming and friendly. They all get to know you. The best part is they eventually are able to suggest new beers based on your specific taste (like I said  we go here a lot haha). I really love that they have been partnering up with other great businesses in manayunk like Volo and Sweet Elizabeth's. By far the best spot to go to to get around the typical \\manayunk crowd\\\".\"\n",
      "Great for a Sunday funday.  I hate saying that word but it's true.  The mac and cheese burger is definitely something you've got to try  trust me!\n",
      "Went last night and only had a hot dog with Mac n cheese. I've been sick all night with no end in sight. I'm sure the beer drinks are fine but I will not be eating there again.\n",
      "great food and service  good beer selection\n",
      "Spread is my go-to lazy weekend breakfast spot. Strong coffee with free refills  bagels fresh from the wood-burning oven served with some classic R&B tunes  and only a block from Rittenhouse Square (ideal for picnicking). The line is often long but it moves quickly  and the local ingredients are worth the extra dollar or two. True  Montreal bagels are not the same as New York bagels  but can't I make room in my belly for both?\n",
      "Man what can I say.  These place has all three ambiance  great taste and great customer service.\n",
      "I'm a New Yorker at heart.   We take our bagels seriously.   We can't stand the mass produced wads of bread that masquerade for bagels at the pseudo-bagel chains.   Spread is serious bagels. Craft made. Matched with in store made spreads.  The real deal.\n",
      "Being from NJ  it's been so hard to find an acceptable bagel place in Philadelphia. I don't know what it is but the bagels in this city stink! Spread  however  is the exception to this rule!  The bagels here are just so yummy. I'm a huge fan of the toasted everything bagel with cream cheese and a fresh squeezed juice.   To avoid the outrageous line wrapped outside on the weekends  try calling ahead to pick up an order to go! Or... Go in around 2 PM :)  My only gripe is that a bagel is like $5. Really? Meh.\n",
      "Expect a wait  especially on the weekends. When I arrived  around 11AM on a Sunday morning  the line was out the door. I got an everything bagel with smoked salmon cream cheese  and it was delicious. I really enjoyed the montreal style  brick-oven toasted  bagels. It maintained the appropriate combination of crispiness and fluffiness. The smoked salmon spread  while a little light on the smoked salmon  was fine. Bagels were completed only a minute after ordering. I'm assuming the breakfast sandwiches take significantly longer to make.   My only relevant complaints regard the size and price of the bagels. Bagels definitely aren't NYC-style behemoths  but they definitely include a price premium. I bought two bagels with cream cheeses and two OJs  and the total was $17 bucks... definitely not your typical neighborhood price point.\n",
      "Insanely overpriced. My sausage  egg  and cheese sandwich cost over $7!!! If I'm paying $7 for a breakfast sandwich  it better knock my socks off. I thought the sandwich was very underwhelming. The eggs lacked flavor and the bagel was hard and tasted too much like burnt garlic. You can get a much better breakfast sandwich (for $4 cheaper) down the street at Palm Tree Gourmet.  In college I worked right next door to a deli that (in my opinion) served the greatest bagels/breakfast sandwiches ever  so I may be holding this place to unfairly high standards. Regardless  I can't justify paying that much money for a mediocre sandwich. Not to mention this place is tiny and always so crowded.  I probably won't return.\n",
      "Love the bagels  but always take mine plain (they do not have non-dairy spreads). The coffee is meh. I'm not a fan of La Colombe (worst coffee ever) so I wish they'd offer another option. Either way  4 our of 5 stars.\n",
      "I'm a huge bagel snob. The bagels I had every Sunday growing up are simply nowhere to be found in Philly  and I've come to terms with that. But when I heard that Spread was serving Montreal-style  which apparently are like the deep-dish of the pizza world (similar  yet not comparable to the traditional choice)  I figured I'd give it a try.  Listen - the food was good. I found the bagel to be a little strange  but it certainly was tasty. The spread (I got the lox cream cheese) was delicious  and the egg was perfectly cooked.   So why 3 stars? Well  the service was a 5 star experience. I ordered to go  and the speed was beyond fast. And they take LevelUp  which gave them some points in my book. But the price is insane. I can't believe I spent $12 on a bagel with cream cheese (not actual lox!) and an iced coffee. Cannot believe it.  I'd say the food is 3.5 stars  the service is 5  the tiny checkout space is a 2 and the prices are a 1. If you're not concerned about price than definitely stop by and try these Canadian bagel things. But if you're trying to save your money I'd head somewhere else.\n",
      "Spread is a great bagel place in an area lacking any other bagel places. Their bagels are very unique and doughier than normal. They also bake them in house in a huge fire burning oven  which gives the bagels a bit of a smoky taste.  It's a great lunch place. Bagel melts are cheap and pretty good once re-toasted. Their bagels and sandwiches are definitely on the pricey side  but very good  with many fresh  house made ingredients.  I can't speak for the line on Saturday and Sunday mornings  but I've heard it can get pretty long. Call ahead to order before picking up. I've picked up a couple bagels on Saturday for Sunday morning  and they just don't retain their great Spread-y quality.  Overall  good neighborhood bagel spot.\n",
      "I wanted a bagel place close to home so we decided to go here. The everything bagel was okay  it tasted too much like sesame seeds and less of everything else. The bagel was big but It was too \\flat\\\" (even more deflated than other montreal bagels) so I didn't get much of the bagel texture.  If you do decide to visit this place  definitely get the cream cheese with the smoked salmon inside  the smoked salmon was pretty good but honestly  its hard to mess up on smoked salmon. I would go here to buy their spreads  but I personally didn't enjoy their bagels as much\"\n",
      "Excellent place  the owner greets you and is very friendly. They give you so much food its incredible. The service was spot on. I recommend making a reservation because you might not get a table\n",
      "wonderful atmosphere!!! comfortable  and BYOB fresh food  amazing service....after the boyfriend and i  brought a bottle of red wine  and could get the cork open  a nice family traded bottles with us  so we could! love love love!!!!!\n",
      "Absolutely amazing. I came here last Friday with my boyfriend and we had a reservation for 8:45. We were seated within a few minutes. The staff is truly made up of some of the kindest people you will ever meet. They brought us bread and roasted carrots  and also an appetizer on the house. All of these were delicious. It is also a BYOB which is great. The food and atmosphere were both amazing. We had the gnocchi with pesto  chicken parm  and nutella soufflé. Our waiter was always friendly and we were never left waiting for something.\n",
      "Amazing  beautiful and the staff was so nice and helpful. Love the family feel of this restaurant makes you feel like your at your grandmothers house for Sunday dinner! Can't wait to go back\n",
      "This is EASILY the best italian food in Philadelphia. It is a wonderful experience eating here. The staff is AMAZING! Our server  Eric was so nice and accommodating. The special eggplant appetizer in the Rosa sauce was heavenly. I ordered the chicken piccata  and I ALWAYS get chicken piccata out.. this was the best I have ever had. The cheesecake and cappuccino was outstanding. I have never had such an enjoyable eating experience! Seriously wonderful. I will be back again!!!!!\n",
      "One of the best Italian restaurants I've been to period. Not only is the food absolutely delicious  but the service is just as good. The owner introduced herself and told us about the local favs. Being from NY I was a bit skeptical but truly impressed with the apps  entrees and dessert. Definitely would repeat any day of the week. Drinks were good as well. Will be stopping here any and every time I visit Philly!!!\n",
      "I was looking for authentic \\South Philly Italian\\\" food and I found it here!  I had this seafood pasta dish and unlike some places where they scrimp  these guys poured it on.  Plenty of seafood  very tasty and very friendly service.  I would return again.\"\n",
      "Absolutely amazing  I walked into this restaurant and was greeted by the owner. What an unbelievable experience! From the presentation to the food to the service everything was amazing. Made me feel at home\n",
      "My husband and I had dinner here last night (Tuesday).  Food was great  service friendly and prompt. Nice atmosphere.  They have bar service but you are allowed to bring your own wine  (which we did).  I had a special that was a Homemade fettuccini with seafood that was awesome.  Great find!\n",
      "One of the best meals we have had in a long Time. Will definitely be back soon. Even my 8 year old loved it!\n",
      "With a pizza museum  little baby's ice cream next door  and some pretty creative pizza names this place is in a league of it's own.  The FORBES WAGGENSENSEN is probably my favorite with the GRANNY DIVJACK coming in at a close second. The pepperoni they use on the FORBES WAGGENSENSEN is awesome. I have been back for more already and will continue to make some trips up to Fishtown to visit Pizza Brain.  If you are a Philadelphian and you haven't been here  you need to get there soon.\n",
      "This is easily my latest favorite pizza in the entire city and I hope it stays that way. I've had slices of their Jane (plain) and Forbes Waggensense (pepperoni) several times plus a few others.  Each and every single time I've been in there  I've been greeted by enthusiastic and happy silly pizza people. One time I brought a group up on a walk up from Barcade that was completely underestimated. We ended up walking in right before closing and were happily greeted. They fired up the oven and were way too accommodating especially with how so many of us rolled up so late in their evening.  I crave their pizza constantly and always look forward to when I can make it up there. I'm also not a huge ice cream person but the fact that Little Baby's is next door is definitely changing that. I only wish that between the two of them they had more seating because it definitely gets crowded in there some nights. Here's to hoping for a second location.\n",
      "Pizza Brain is a fun spot to stop in for a slice. The staff is friendly  the pizza is very good  the decor is entertaining with all its memorabilia and fun facts. I enjoyed the BBQ chicken slices  and am looking forward to trying some of the other offerings.\n",
      "As a first time customer I was really impressed with the food  service  and ambience. Loved all the little details in the decor and was thrilled with the menu choices! Amazing pizza and so great that there are vegan options. And loved that it was connected to an ice cream shop!\n",
      "Pizza Brain never disappoints  that's why they deserve every star in this rating. Since I don't live in the neighborhood  I use any excuse to be above Spring Garden to visit this place. The classic options (plain  pepperoni  etc.) are so flavorful and great but you can also feel comfortable trying something completely different.   I have had the General Tso's which is pretty self-explanatory and a full meal on your pizza and recently tried the Bob Shieldsmoose. I was pretty nervous about this one - I thought the blue cheese  house roasted beef brisket  garlic  horseradish  black pepper  mozzarella  fresh rosemary might be a bit much - but it was so so so good. It's pies like that that convince you these people are serious about food.  The pizza alone would warrant a great review  but it would be wrong not to mention the staff and atmosphere. People are really friendly and actually seem like they're having a good time behind the counter. That attitude is infectious.\n",
      "Besides being one of the coolest  most low-key places I've been to in Philly  the pizza is superb! I had the Lucy Waggle and it was flawless. I took it home and they put the arugula in a separate container so it didn't wilt  which I really appreciated. I had the pizza a while after getting it and it was still delicious and super fresh. I cannot wait to go back and try some more pies!\n",
      "Much has been said about Pizza Brain  but go and try it already.  Good crust and ingredients make for some tasty pies.  The prices are on the high side  but like everything in life  you get what you pay for.\n",
      "There is a lot to like about Pizza Brain.  Based on the earlier comments I considered giving a lower score just to see if I too would get a response from the owner.  I understand the impact of social media but you have to take the good with the bad.  Without negative reviews  yelp would be of no use to people like me.  I doubt the owners were complaining when philly mag was singing their praises orpromoting them on foobooz.  If  after this review anyone would like more insight from me  just ask.  If you don't care what I think  no hard feelings.  Anyways  on to the food which is the important part.  We came  in part  because we need dairy free options and heard they do a vegan pizza.  I therefore cannot speak to their cheese pizzas.  We ordered a red pizza with arugula and pepperoni.  It was very satisfying and we found the crust tasty.  Sauce was excellent and actually tasted better the next day cold coming out of the fridge (who doesn't love cold pizza).  The arugula was fresh and awesome and I would recommend it to anyone who wants something slightly different.  On the otherhand the pepperoni was nothing special and got lost in the mix.  As others have said this appears to be a hipster haunt but we are far from hipsters and found it quite friendly.  Plenty of other families present.  In fact one other family in the courtyard offered to share their table.  I love that type of community.    My one complaint would be the beverage options but now I know (and I'm telling you) to byob.  Also remember to bring your cash as it is cash only.  Frankly.it would be better if they took levelup like the icecream shop next door.  The icecream is great too  but worthy of separate thought.  We'll be back and look forward to trying more options.\n",
      "This pizza is fabulous. Today  the owner was at the door  and oriented us to the joint. We have kids and entirely fail in the hipster department. We don't care  and neither does anybody at Pizza Brain. It's a bit of a drive for us  so I doubt we'll be able to make it often. Too bad.  If I lived anywhere nearby  I'd order pizza from this place every time. Not sure why all the negativity. The crust is superb  the char is a thing of beauty. The sauce has exquisite flavor and the cheeses were really good quality. The pepperoni is to die for. There really isn't anything bad to say about it.\n",
      "Aside from all the gimmicks: the crap on the walls  the supercilious toppings which are all a touch too salty  and the prices  Pizza Brain has down properly the one thing all other take out pizzas (including NYC) don't.  It is the right chew in the crust.  When you bite into the crust  the crackling exterior gives way to a soft  doughy middle  which should yield to your bite but keep a firm grip as you pull away.  It should feel like the center of the pizza is in a brief tug of war with your teeth.  That's pizza and Pizza Brain does it.\n",

      "Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kitten may tickle Julie Andrew's fancy  but bargains and sushi are two of MY favorite things.   And I have found it all here  not in the beautiful hills of Austria  on the filthy streets of Philadelphia.   All you can eat sushi: $25 3 rolls (24 pieces!) : $12  It's good sushi. The fish is fresh and the newish decor is funky nuvo asian. The service is always efficient and the bathrooms are clean (something I find fairly indicative of the quality in a sushi restaurant).  Anyway  the next time the Von Trapps are in town  take them when they are sick of wienerschnitzel and want something cheap  fast  and fresh.\n",
      "I'm not your typical sushi lover  but when I get a craving- I NEED a lobster mazy roll from AKI. If you can put sushi down like nobody's business  do the all-you-can-eat- menu bc the regular rolls are pretty good (usually get the shrimp tempura- best ones in the city- and the yellowtail and scallion) and for an extra 5 bucks each you can add specialty rolls like the lobster mazy (to die for). If you're doing a light meal  make sure you get the avocado salad with ginger dressing. I'm almost positive there's crack in the dressing- yes its that good. This place is also great for date night (red comfy couch type booths) or group outings (dark wood tables). The place has a nice ambience with dim lights. Overall  a great sushi spot. Only things that sucks is there's never any parking  but there is a lot across the street.\n",
      "Best all you can eat I've ever done. There is such a wide selection of nigiri and sashmi- and you can still get your specialty roll fix! Plus  appetizers are up for grabs  so you actually leave feeling like you got a deal (and paid less than going a la carte).  Definitely not inexpensive  so come HUNGRY. But the quality is great. I'm STILL drooling over the white tuna nigiri.\n",
      "I had a horrible experience at Aki today. They had 3 servers covering the entire restaurant. I sat at the bar and could only get attention in 15 min increments. In addition  I was only going to do 2 rolls and a soup so I knew I wouldnt need the All you can eat menu. Anyway  the server comes over  doesnt ask me what I want to drink. I ordered and he brings the food out with no utensils. I asked him for a plate  he forgets chopsticks  I ask for chopsticks  he doesnt bring soy sauce with the sushi. I did not realize I would have to ask for each of these things specifically in order to receive them. The soup was good and I ordered shrimp shumai. It came out with 3 little pieces of shumai  which I know is not a $6 order of shumai. Perhaps he was giving me the All you can eat portion size. Anyway  after I ate and asked for check  it took about 15 minutes for the check to come and he brought it out and charged me $30 (the all you can eat price). I said no  adding up everything I got  it does not exceed $21. He said he entered it into the system and this price came out cheaper. I said once again that I had seen the prices and there's no way it was more than $21. He said \\no  this is cheaper  your order comes to $32 otherwise\\\" I did not want to argue anymore even thought I know he was clearly miscalculating because 2 $6 rolls is 12 plus $6 for the bitty shumai is $18 plus $2.50 for the miso soup is $21.50. Anyway  I paid and I left but I feel ripped off!! And to think my coworkers rave about this place. Wait till they hear this...\"\n",
      "Ate here while we were at a conference. We got sushi and fried rice. The fried rice was just salty  not other taste than salt. Sushi was less than average  rice was way too cooked and was mushy. Rolls with tempura inside were cold. Two stars because staff is very friendly and tries to be accommodating\n",
      "Holy Hell. Aki  how many ways did I loathe my experience with you? Let me count the ways.   1. Your watered down soy sauce. Let's start at the most illustrative and representative point. You couldn't even get your soy sauce right. Never in my life have I complained about the soy sauce. I mean  I feel silly writing this  but in a blind taste test  your soy sauce could not be differentiated between lukewarm sea water with a little bit of regurgitated wasabi in it. If you can't get soy sauce right  you know you are probably in for a wild ride. And boy were we ever.   2. For the first time ever  I found multiple bones and gristle (for lack of a better word) in my fish. Having to pull bones and gristle out of my mouth mid-chew didn't jive with my date night feel I was going for.   3. Your fish was curiously warm and the texture was concerning. Enough said  this is not high quality or fresh fish by any stretch of the imagination.   4. You did not serve me sushi. You served me lukewarm and overaged fished limply draped over a soggy pile of rice. It was like a sad  dying golden retriever putting his head on your knee for the last time before you take him to the vet to be put down. Nothing sadder. On top of that  they don't put wasabi between the fish and the rice. You shouldn't have some yelp reviewer with clearly too much time on his hands teaching you the fundamentals of sushi.   5. The service was barely existent. I saw my server 4 times throughout the night  but she was busy  so I blame the same people who re-re-re-refridgerate the fish they serve and not the hard working servers who are understaffed.   6. We bought the Groupon  but still feel like I overpaid. I've gone to all you can eat buffets in florida who have sushi the same quality as this place. I saw they do all you can eat sushi  which indicates it's not financially viable to serve high quality fish with this offer  but then everyone suffers  regardless of whether or not we want to participate in this gluttonous act. It's basically failed socialism  with stinky fish.    Bottom line  there are SO SO SO MANY good sushi places in Philly. Most of them cheaper than this place and BYOB. Save yourself  the time  money  and fiery post consumption diarrhea and go somewhere else.\n",
      "I only eat veggie sushi  so my perspective might be a little different from other reviewers.   The lunch special is amazing! Three (huge) rolls  and soup or a salad for 11 bucks. If you order it right at or before 3pm  you get the special  so you can even order it and carry it home for dinner. The avocado is ripe  the rice doesn't fall off the sushi  and the (gluteney  soon to be discarded) soy sauce comes in a separate packet.  They deliver too.\n",
      "We came out for date night and let me tell you all this was such a great experience! We ordered the happy hour special for our first time. For appetizers we had fried chicken with this amazing yellow sauce  this great salad with ginger miso salad dressing -- the bomb! And the peas were our favorite appetizer wise! For our entree we had a choice of 5 meats. We enjoyed cooking our dinner with the spicy sauce to add some more flavor  even tho the meat by itself was just as great. Addition to our entree we enjoyed two rounds Bellinis ( strawberry  peach  mango  and lychee flavor) for dessert we had s'mores!!!! Delicious! We are excited to come back again for happy hour and enjoy a different selection. The staff are very welcoming and friendly. The atmosphere is really relaxing and you feel like you are in your own private space to enjoy it! Reservations are essential!!\n",
      "The food is fine and reasonably priced  but it should be  since you cook it yourself. The portion sizes were small  the menu does have pictures  but they lack perspective  so portion size is hard to judge.  Would be good and fun for a large group  and the novelty is neat but overall not worthy of 4 stars.\n",
      "A hand written 20% tip was added to our bill automatically. If a party over 4 are automatically charged a service fee it should be clearly written on the menu however we failed to find any notice about that. Lousy service from start to end. NEVER coming back again  NO.\n",
      "So  my recommendation is NOT to get the AYCE at this place. This is their gimmick to get you in but then they give you 90 minutes to eat with 2 items per person. And that's fine right? Yeah  what they fail to tell you is that they will literally space out each item 20 minutes apart. So you'll be able to get like 4 stuff!!! My husband priced out the food they had given us and it was $40. We paid $70.  Order the A la Carte. I was totally hating on my server but I'm sure it was management mandated.\n",
      "The food was mediocre to say the least...the service was HORRIBLE! It took over an hour and fifteen minutes for them to bring out the entire order. Not to mention they forgot one of our orders which we just ended up asking them to remove from the bill because we didn't want to risk having to wait another hour for that to come out. Even something as simple as clearing the table or making sure drinks were constantly filled seemed to be a difficult task.  To top it off  adjusting the bill took them forever and one of us ended up going up to the register for the check and bringing it back to the table. They might as well promote this place as a self service restaurant  \\clear your own table  get your own check\\\" next you'll have to get your own food! Never coming back here again!\"\n",
      "I went to Gyu Gaku the Thursday before the fourth of July to celebrate starting my own business. I had a party of six and we were all seated pretty much immediately. This place is a few blocks down from my apartment and  sadly  never seems to get much business.   I have to say that Gyu Gaku's food was amazing and the source of most its points here. My boyfriend and I split the Kobe style steak combo and had a ton to eat because it was all so delicious. I really can't say enough good things. Everything from the beginning salad  edamame  and Miso soup to the bibimbap were delectable  and the meat was no less so. It's really the best food I've had  at the best price  in a long time.   Our server was friendly enough  and everything came out in good order. I don't really have any complaints about the service  but it honestly wasn't stellar. I would be concerned about visiting on a busy night. A weird atmosphere note: the happy 60s pop music was really strange with the Japanese theme and decor  but not unpleasant.  Honestly  though  I loved our time there  and I hope to take advantage of their lunch specials and upcoming all you can eat event! So tasty.\n",
      "Great place  very slow at bringing food out  hosts keeps coming to table like they want you out.... we would have been done if food was brought out at a faster rate\n",
      "I have never had a waitress as energic  as wonderful  as attentive  nor as happy as Crystal. You could tell that she loved her job. I was in a low mood and she lifted me up. She has such a great soul and even watching her serve everyone else was like remarkable to me.   The food here is superb  the staff is great and Crystal just made my whole night. The hostess Montana when you enter was also super sweet. Mohamed was also super nice - he wasn't my waiter but he was great and also answered questions I had. This place as a whole made my entire night. Definitely coming here again and definitely bringing friends and family.\n",
      "I was very excited when I found out that Gyu-Kaku open a store in philly. They offered a good selection of meats/dishes and have some good special deals for lunch and happy hour.   It will be a great addition to the museum district. It's not so packed yet  so not much of waiting during our visits.\n",
      "I've been coming to Gyu-Kaku for a long time and I really enjoy this restaurant. It's fun to use the grills and the meat and vegetables are always fresh! They also have a great app where you can rack up points for free food!   The only negative things I have to say is that in the summer it can be a little hot with all the grills - so ventilation could be better. And at times service can be slow or things come in the wrong order.  Definitely would recommend trying this unique Japanese BBQ spot! It's so fun and easy and well-priced!\n",
      "Service was good. Calamari jalapeños carrots were good  but rather greasy. Lava sauce was good.\n",
      "Private party upstairs - terrific buffet: bbq pork sliders  hamburgers  salmon and rice  salad  biscuits  bbq thighs  fruit salad.  Bar area downstairs: welcoming wood paneling  super large sculling boat above bar  fun large brass fixtures. Staffing was good. Sincere efforts from wait staff to kitchen staff\n",
      "Awesome setting with a really unique interior and open air dining.   The menu describes the dishes a bit too well--they are not as good as you might think by reading the description. It is also pretty expensive for the food quality  but I guess that you are paying for the ambiance.    I had the calamari  described in another review  and found it to be pretty good. It had fried carrot strips I think  in addition to jalapenos and calamari. My spinach salad was pretty basic but not bad at all.\n",
      "Stopped in Sunday afternoon after a freezing visit to ESP  which is across the road. Was packed with (family) brunch/lunchers and peeps carbo-loading after the marathon. Great cosy  atmosphere in a re-purposed firehouse. Large plate with a Philly cheesesteak and fries later I was very satisfied. Cheesesteak was great but the (in-house produced) fries really impressed me. My partner had a salad with chicken. Large portion and the chicken had a lovely smoked flavour. Slightly pricey but the size of the portions made up for that. Glad we came...see u again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a great experience. We sat on the patio which was a nice touch on a beautiful day  however the food was not good. My pancakes were incredibly dense and the sausages were fried so long that they resembled taquitos. My partners breakfast quesadilla was not good either and left him feeling queasy. My mojito was also not very good and tasted mainly of club soda.   The one bright spot of the meal were the biscuits and sour cherries served prior to the arrival of the food. They were in fact very good. Overall I would not recommend this spot to a friend.\n",
      "Bad service and bad food. My boyfriend and I went here for a late lunch early dinner. We love food and to eat out. Not only was the food bad but so was the service. Our waitress was clearly not interested in what we ordered  got our drink orders wrong and didn't offer to exchange for what was actually ordered. On the menu they say they work with local ingredients. There's no way they're doing this and the product advertised on the menu is not what we received. The appetizers came and the soup was cold and clearly frozen not made with local ingredients. When our entree came my crab cake sandwich was so fishy and fell apart instantly. My boyfriend's fish was advertised as a pecan encrusted fish with basil aioli. Not only was the fish not cooked with pecans  but it came with no aioli. My boyfriend had to ask for it on the side. I've never had such a bad meal in Philadelphia.\n",
      "Great service. Interesting building. But the food is mediocre and SERIOUSLY overpriced. It's a tourist trap preying off people going to the E State Pen across the street. The ribs were good  but the pulled pork and other BBQ were subpar  the biscuits were dense and flavorless  and the veggie sides were overlooked and tasteless. $3 coke was an insult. There are many better options within walking distance. Don't waste your money.\n",
      "We went to Jacks on a date night with another couple. We went early evening after work and got a nice table outside. We ordered the BBQ Platter for the four of us. It was plenty of food and it was all very tasty! For $37.95 you get fries  chips  pulled pork  ribs  and I think there was some brisket in there. Very satisfying and hit the spot for all of us! Nice service and a nice atmosphere as well.\n",
      "Recent resident of Fairmount and couldn't ask for a friendlier local restaurant and bar. The bartenders are the friendliest  yet most professional I've met. They have excellent local beers  an endless supply of quality liquors all served in a classy yet rustic setting. The food is good and always served with a smile. The cookies can't be beat and only add to the care with which Jack's treats its customers.\n",
      "Red snapper is a great litmus test for any sushi connoisseur. The skin should be left on  but it should be flash boiled (skin only) leaving the flesh raw and delicious. Zama did get this right.  it is a technique that takes some care to achieve.   I was not able to really try the whole sushi experience   as I was with a large group of people ordering rolls.  What I did eat was good  and is worth another visit if I ever get back to Philly.\n",
      "All my friend we raving about this place  i had to go check it out.  Not bad      i ordered miso soup  a little salt  but good Kaiso seaweed salad  gotta have a seaweed salad  very nice.   Bronzizzle  ehhh... i was a little disappointed  it was a really messy roll  it kept falling apart and drenched in soy sauce  very salty. however  their sashimi was excellent  it very fresh. i liked.\n",
      "I went here for restaurant week for my anniversary. The service and ambience was great. Every course  from the salad to the sushi to the salmon  was fantastic. The location (Rittenhouse Square) is always nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "yum!!!! my favorite sushi joint in philly... im still salivating over the thought of the delicious and meticulously made sushi. i came for lunch  so i can only speak about my lunch experience.   my favorite roll was the shrimp and eel fiesta roll. it was such a powerful kick to add a little mexican twist to sushi. the lunch sushi and nigiri special was good. the hand rolls are really spectacular because they are wrapped in this non-seaweed wrapper. i want to say it is soy based but i am not sure. i think the roll and the hand rolls were the best.  one of the handrolls was alright  but the other two was very flavorful (one of the good ones was the spicy tuna).  and this place has low sodium soy sauce (yay!) i hear the cod is amazing  but ill have to try that next time!  the decor was beautiful! minimalist and clean  yet the place did not feel cold or uninviting.\n",
      "I had a major sushi craving this week and decided to indulge on payday. I got the maki combination lunch special with the salmon and avocado roll  spicy tuna roll  and the yellowtail  jalapeno  and mango roll.  While they were all very good  the yellowtail  jalapeno  and mango was a standout-- a great mix of flavors and the jalapeno lent some crunch and heat.  I also appreciated that the spicy tuna was a whole piece of fish  rather than the finely chopped fish combined with spicy mayo that you get at some other places.  Yes  it was more on the expensive side (especially for a lunch)  but I understood it for the quality of the fish.  I'd definitely come back.\n",
      "I brought my boyfriend to Zama for his birthday dinner and we were pleasantly surprised by not only the delicious food  but also by the service and fair pricing. We started with the pan seared pork dumplings  followed by an array of sushi rolls  and finished with their \\mini desserts\\\" which allows you to pick 3 options for $12. How awesome! We tried the salted caramel mochi which is imported from Japan  their tofu beignets with chocolate and caramel dipping sauce  and the salted dark chocolate mousse. We were stuffed before dessert came out but had to finish every bite. And the cocktails were to die for! I tried the Japanese 75 with sake  vodka  and St Germaine and drained every drop.   Our waitress  Fedra  was so sweet! Knowledgeable about the menu  quick service  suggested her favorites  and overall very pleasant and kind.   Will absolutely be back.\"\n",
      "Oh  Zama - you truly rock my sushi lovin' world. Tonight I dined alone but was still treated well (thank you!) as I sat at the 8 chair sushi bar and watched the chefs work their magic.  A single negi-chu-toro hand roll was buttery perfection. A $28 (7 piece nigiri) of market specials was delicious and 5 of the 7 fish I had never tried or never even heard of.  All delicious.  Perfectly marinated ikura (salmon roe) - although for $5.00 a piece - the portion was very tiny.  (Like 18 eggs or so.  Come on  guys!)  And for \\dessert\\\" 2 perfect slices of house-made tamago (none of that frozen garbage here!).  Domo! Domo!  I am infatuated (once again) with Zama.  Decor is Zen  sleek & lovely.  (Look up to see the giant Koi above you.)  $60 including tax 'n tip (no alcohol) is pretty steep though.  My husband may freak out on me.  It also underscores what a GREAT value Doma is and how high-priced Morimoto is.  (Zama is right in between.)\"\n",
      "Love their cod fish  very special and yummy. The sauce is sweet but good  the fish skin is crispy.  I m not crazy about Their dessert too little.\n",
      "This is by far one of my most favorite dining experiences. I've had sushi of all caliber  from $7 rolls in midtown Manhattan  to $200 prix fixe tasting menus. I was super surprised as the quality of the food and the exceptional service.   I really wish I got the waitress' name. She was blonde and I believe I overheard her saying she's been at the location for over a year. Well  she was probably one of the most exceptional servers I've ever had.  As for the food: The sushi was fresh  well prepared and delicious. I am not the sushi eater that drenches his food in soy sauce. I enjoy the subtle flavors of fish and the sauces as prepared by the chef. So  with that in mind  I have to admit that the balance in flavor profiles of the dishes that I had ordered was quite exquisite.. We had ordered the Branzizzle Roll  which had a nice citrusy flavor that really brings out the branzino used in the roll. The drinks were top-notch too.   Please  if you are ever in the city of Philadelphia  you have to come here and try this place.\n",
      "The stars are for food only.  I was in a party of 6 + a toddler who arrived on a Friday night with a reservation.  The upstairs was about half filled when we arrived.  Our waitress came to take our order and we asked about the size of the pizza.  She suggested that we order 1 app and 1 pizza per couple.  So my husband and I did just that.  She took the orders but did not write anything down.  While waiting for food  two members did not receive their ordered drinks and had to remind the waitress.  The waters were only refilled once  when we had to request after several of us had already finished the glass.  Then when dinner came a different server delivered the pizzas to us but our ordered pizza was not part of his delivery.  Turns out the waitress put the wrong order in. So we had to wait for another pizza to be made.  By the time it was delivered  not only were we starving but the rest of our group had already finished their dinners and the toddler was ready to leave.  The waitress delivered the bill and stated  since you're a party of 6 the tip is part of the bill.  That felt like insult to injury.  She messed things up and she still gets a pretty big tip for doing minimal work  poorly.  It's one thing to make an accident  but she made several missteps and still didn't write down the orders for the other tables.  I was really disappointed at the service... suggestion- don't arrive hungry and plan to repeat your order.\n",
      "Here's a gimmick that will win me over every time: drizzled honey on a hot  steaming pizza pie.  Nomad got the memo and our decision couldn't have been easier - the Spicy Soppressata. There's just something about mixing sausage grease and zesty garlic with sweet honey that speaks to me. I mean  the milky fresh mozzarella and soft  yet slightly charred dough certainly never hurt either  but that's to be expected on most pies of this caliber. Even though Nomad's pizza could be considered Neapolitan \\wet\\\"  ironically  the tomato sauce was noticeably still too thin and watery. Other than that  this Spicy Soppressata pick was excellent.   Our waitress assured us that their pizzas were single-serve  but I'm tellin' you  that's aggressive. Even the most ambitious of eaters at our group dinner reluctantly had leftovers. I split the pie with my wife  after ordering a special salad to share as well  and that seemed to be perfect for us. It was a Woodfired Roasted Corn Salad  employing oranges  avocado  cherry tomatoes  shallots  jalapeños  and fava beans - a nice  refreshing  summery teaser before our spicy  sausage-y main course.  Also refreshing and recommended  if available  is their special Spiked Shandy Beer Cocktail. Nomad's take on the ale and lemonade favorite uses St. Germaine  tequila  (you guessed it) honey  and (you probably didn't guess it) honey-flavored Shawnee Apiarius beer. Despite this onslaught of alcohols  it was decidedly smooth.  Now  I know it's summer and sometimes it's nice to keep all the doors open to catch a breeze  but Nomad was hot as balls inside - hotter than outside given how central the wood-burning store is to the dining room. I think you can see by my praise for everything we ate that we eventually got over it  but it's still something worth noting if you're prone to the meat sweats (or even the regular sweats). Again  as for hot honey on a hot sausage pie? Well  that's some heat I can handle.\"\n",
      "Hands-down my favorite pizza spot in Philly. The Margherita di Bufala is perfection. The basil is fresh  there is JUST the right amount of chewy mozzarella  and the sauce hits the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The last time I was here  I asked for garlic and they brought out fresh garlic in olive oil instead of the typical dried garlic powder  which impressed me even more. Every time I even walk by the intersection where Nomad is located  I develop a sudden craving for pizza and start salivating like Pavlov's dog. Mmm.\n",
      "Nomad Pizza - oh how I love your delicious crust (aged bread um hum)  gooey cheese  and savory toppings (can you say Portabello mushrooms)! I first discovered Nomad at the Pizza Olympics last year  and I can't keep myself from going back for more of their unbelievably wonderful pizza. The classic mozzarella and portabello mushroom are my favorites. Oh  yes - their pizza is so good. Must go there now\n",
      "Cozy lil spot  outdoor seating  wine on tap! All good things  in my book.   Arancini balls made a perfect bite to start  extra points for serving them with a small arugula side salad. #Greenz  Ended up spilling not one  but two beers (oops) during our stay  and our waiter swooped in to the rescue with a towel almost immediately both times.   Green dream  margherita di bufala and quattro formaggi were perfect to split between four people. Ordered a side of red sauce for kicks- that was a wise decision.  Lastly  the chocolate coins that come with the bill. The icing on the cake of this very good  very fine meal.\n",
      "The margherita di bufala is superb! The sause  the cheese... ummmm... Just the right taste! Alos had their special summer watermelon salad. Very summery!\n",
      "Amazing pizza! The crust was fantastic  recommend both the margarita and the four cheese. Can't wait to come back.\n",
      "Very good pie. I prefer my pies not only thin crust but more on the well done side  so i like the fact Nomad gets that slightly burnt (but not burnt) crust that holds up well when you lift a slice.   Definitely worth checking out  both the sausage and pepperoni pies are winners\n",
      "We were lucky enough to be invited to the fantastic Yelp party here this week and try all of the great pies.  The location is a little hidden  but the layout and decor is very nice.  I loved the idea of the upstairs bar/projector room/meeting space.  It's a great idea and a smart way to hold your customers in the building for much longer.    I was very impressed with the staff.  They were all very friendly and added to the atmosphere of the room.  The craft beer selection is good and the wine list is adequate.  I enjoyed the salads  but they weren't anything to write home about.  The star of the show is the pizza dough.  It is a perfect combination of taste and texture.  It's a little chewy  a little flaky  and has a great buttery (almost sweet) taste.  I really don't have a single complaint about any of the pizzas.  I'm definitely partial to the truffle  mushroom  egg concoction.  A really superb pizza.  I'm docking a full star for the menu prices.  These are pretty small pizzas (probably in the 10-12\\ range)  and $16 to $19 for one of them seems a bit much.  Going there for a two hour movie  pizza  and drinks could turn into a very pricey pizza night.\"\n",
      "MMMMMM Nomad. I should preface this by saying that my date and I were pretty drunk when we went here  but I really don't think that is influencing my review decision here.   We walked/stumbled in  were sat at the bar. The service was great and very patient with our slow-decision making.  We tried a salad and a pizza.. the one with homemade mozzarella. The salad was huge  fresh  tasted great.  The pizza was so good.  I wish I had been more sober to better enjoy it but I guess instead ill just have to go back again. The crust was yummy and perfect  the whole thing was delicious. it was cool to watch them making the pizzas too  from where we sat.\n",
      "I was disappointed by Time. I went on a Saturday night. There was a long line to get in and then a cover charge I was not aware of. Getting inside there is live music downstairs and recorded music upstairs. In theory  this sounds great  but it was more uncomfortable than anything. The music upstairs was hard to dance to  plus it was so crowded that I kept getting elbowed or beer spilled on me throughout the night. It was so packed I couldn't even try making it to the bar to get a drink. This place was more of a buzzkill than anything else.\n",
      "My family and i waited in a long line that moved fairly fast. Once we got it  it was a $5 cover charge. We paid and went upstairs. The music was decent but it was super crowded. The floors were so sticky they were disgusting. I had to leave.   My fiance  sister and I went downstairs to whiskey bar instead. This too was super crowded but at least it was more toned down and the floors weren't sticky. We got lucky and scored 3 seats at the bar. We sat there the rest of the night. The bartender was very good and nice. She took very good care of us making sure our drinks were filled and made just how we liked it.   Needless to say this was not our scene but our time in the whiskey bar wasn't horrible. The service was good and the people were very cool.\n",
      "this review is an ode to old Philadelphia and a spit in the face to the yuppie/hipster town that the city is trying to become.... although I fully appreciate a whiskey bar with real whiskey prices  I kind of miss the affordable diveness that was the pinnacle of gayborhood establishments... the food (please white people consult a person of color before you offer fried chicken tot he masses) was average at best.  the wings were tender large and in charge but the mussels lacked flavor of any kind.  the burger was basic at best and the fried chicken dinner entrée was depressing.  please is cutely perfect for that awkward first date and serves as a great watering hole to wash tears of ended relationships down but otherwise it is just another ode to the changing landscape of Philadelphia....\n",
      "The new incarnation of Ludwigs! I wonder if the waitresses gave their old uniforms to the new German beer hall on South Street...  The main floor offers two bars  one is a low key  cozy bar with tables to eat with space for musicians to play. The other bar has booths and is in a smaller room....and gets more rowdy. There's third floor bar that isn't usually open  but this spot offers something for everyone.  Oh! And it's one of the only spots in the city that offers \\absinthye\\\" or as I call it  abstinence. It's served in a cool glass vial with water and sugar cubes. They have an extensive scotch and whiskey selection as well.  Food's hit or miss. I had the mussels and they were awful  but the scallops and risotto balls were good! So  select your food wisely!  But you'll have a good TIME....wacka  wacka!\"\n",
      "3.5 is what I would really want to give this place  but I'll round up for the variety of things to do in the different rooms. I can't believe I am barely reviewing this place now--it was one of my favorite places to hang out on weekends  as long as you get there before 10pm because then you'll have to pay a cover  which  I would prefer not to do here.   The first floor usually has a live band with a couple booths available if you're lucky. The bar in this area is the second best place to get drinks. The atmosphere here is a little more romantic than the other rooms. On the other side is the more \\sports-bar\\\" feel. This is a pretty chill place to hang out  with seats lined up and available bartenders. If you're coming in a big group and want to talk  this is the best place to be. The top floor is ridiculous in so many ways! I like to call this area the \\\"sweat room\\\" since it's where everyone is dancing and getting down  which adds to the terrible air circulation up there.--it literally feels like it's a sauna up there.  There's also a bar up here  but I find this the most inconvenient of them all. Overall  if this is a fun place to be.\"\n",
      "TIME offers a great atmosphere and friendly service- heck even the bouncer is nice. However  it is very crowded and there is little space to enjoy they absinthe drink. Also I am not a fan of the cover charge  as the drinks are pricey.\n",
      "Upon walking in there are two sides  a whiskey bar and a jazz bar. The whiskey bar is is very nice and rustic. Great selection of drinks and knowledgeable staff. The jazz bar is awesome too. A bit more classy and \\lounge-y.\\\" I was there on a Friday night and there was an awesome New Orleans type band. If you want a change of scenery you can go upstairs. There was a DJ playing music with a good sized dance floor area Have been quite a few times and definitely will be back when in the area\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Went with a friend who lives in Philly and goes here often.  The bartenders were awesome. So on top of it. The way a professional bartender should be. We had a delish absinthe drink with the entire spectacle- spoons  sugar  everything. And they band playing on the jazz side was unreal. This is a GREAT Philly hang out!\n",
      "You don't have to be a meat eating machine to enjoy this place.  We indulged ourselves with the artisan cheese plate  a mix of green salad  octopus  and the fish fry.  I loved everything that we ordered.  Anytime i see octopus on the menu it's a definite must.  The fish fry was one of the best if not the best fish chips I've ever had.  The cod tasted very fresh and the breading was light airy but very flavorful.  Our waitress did warn us about over ordering.  I was looking at the seafood paella and she mentioned it might be too much food.  She was right  we had just enough indulgence without feeling overstuffed.  I loved the intimacy of this place.  It's small but not cramped.  Our waitress brought out a delicious strawberry ice cream with blackberry compote all made in house for a birthday treat.  This place will definitely not cramp your wallet.  Their prices are very reasonable and budget friendly compared to other places for tapas around town.  Looking forward to my next trip here already.\n",
      "I can't even put into words how wonderful my experience was here  but I'll try!  First  we were a part of 3 without a reservation (we tried getting one but they were booked and I went anyway hoping they had left room for walk-ins). We waited about 40 minutes before being seated but enjoyed an appetizer and drinks at the bar. The service was EXCELLENT from beginning to end. The host  Adam  was friendly and relaxed and did his best to get us a table in the crowded restaurant. The bar staff was also kind  and made great recommendations. Our sever  Madeline  was fantastic. She was chill and sweet  and we never had to ask for anything as she was always on top of it. The busser was there to clear away and re-mis the table asap.   Now.. for the good part.. the FOOD! This was easily the best meal I've had in a long time. We had the Chef's board (meat and cheese with accompaniments.. need I say more?) crispy eggplant fries (omg) figs and chorizo (incredible) the best brussel sprouts I've ever eaten in my life  a salad with fried goat cheese (yes  fried. goat. cheese.)  Gambas (honestly didn't like them but everything else made me forget)  scallops that I can's stop thinking about  the world's greatest bread pudding (and I didn't even think I liked bread pudding) and the most ridiculous  outrageous  perfectly delicious brownie sundae the world has to offer. Did I mention they also serve La Columbe coffee??!   I can't wait to go back.\n",
      "Came here on a Monday night. I have to say that this place really rocks. Great atmosphere and the waitress was extremely friendly and always made sure everything was okay.   We had a table of two and ordered 3 dishes:  For the appetizer we had the eggplant fries. Hands down  these were the best fries I have had in my life. They had such a crisp outside and melted in your mouth on the inside. I really have to learn how to make this at home!  We also ordered the Charcuteria  a cold cut platter  which was a refreshing intermission between the appetizer and entree.  The both of us shared the Seafood Paella as our final dish. Portions were large enough to share among two people. The paella had a nice sticky consistency and was cooked and flavored perfectly.   I wish I had the chance to try some other tapas  but they don't have a tapas aside from the separate tapas sampling menu  so you have to ask about it or take a look on the specials written on the wall. I am glad I tried the eggplant fries though. Still makes my mouth water thinking about it!\n",
      "Came with some friends for a late-night happy hour. Between the white wine sangria and the red wine sangria  the red is the definite winner. We also ordered some late night happy hour food including a charcuterie board  some deviled eggs  some croquets  and a potato-based frittata. The food was alright  but nothing was amazing. I did not enjoy the frittata though and felt the texture was not there. It satisfied our late night munchies though.\n",
      "OMG - what can I say - this is truly one of the best Tapas restaurants I have been to & I have been to many. It is one of my must go to places every time I am in Philly. The food is incredible  from the bacon wrapped dates to the mushroom flatbread  bronzino  scallops - everything just explodes with flavor. This time we even had dessert  spanish donuts with a dipping sauce - heavenly.  Service is good  space is very tight inside so you have to be comfortable with that type of environment. Also  as others have said it is quite dark inside  but for me that makes for a great intimate place to have a romantic dinner. They do  have outdoor seating in the summer  but it is literally right on the sidewalk with no barrier/plants up so I'm not a huge fan especially in the very hot weather.  I would strongly recommend a reservation as they have a small number of indoor tables & have been very busy every time I have been here. Definitely check this place out if you are in Philly & love tapas!\n",
      "\n",
      "Wonderful Tapas with great flavors  choices and service. The sangria is great and plenty of fine wines by the glass and bottle.\n",
      "Cute place and have been here before because I liked the food BUT the service and staff need an overhaul. We ordered lots and had 2 bottles of cava and still our server was rude and inattentive.  The one host was nice and tried to help but it was too late by then  it ruined our experience.  The people next to use agreed as well. Our woman server clearly didn't want to be there. The vibe was just off.\n",
      "Decent location  decent food  nothing special. Wouldn't exactly recommend people to come here  but it would also be incorrect to say it was a bad restaurant.\n",
      "Hubby and I did 10 tapas and pitcher sangria deal at Jamonera. Papa Frita   charcuterie  duck sausage and quail egg on toast absolutely delicious. Bacon wrapped dates were ok  dates were really sweet and bacon was overcooked. Fried Crab manchego balls and melon  proscuitto salad also really good  sweetness of melon worked well with salty cheese in salad. Spanish tortilla flavor was mediocre  didn't care for the overly salted cream poured over it. Lastly  garlicky mussels and Bronzino  very good. Mussels were not gritty and bread soaked up juices perfectly. Fish was flaky  tender  cooked just right. Enjoyed the Roja sangria  and server was very nice and attentive. He made a great suggestion for a craft beer that my husband enjoyed. All in all we had a good time tonight  would def return soon.  (Music volume was pretty loud but not unbearable  and it's rather dark  so bring your glasses to see menu lol.)\n",
      "I thought that the overly battered fish and chips were the best ones I have had in a while.  The \\hot damn\\\" wings were charred  mostly tasteless under the thick layer of sauce  and turned my fingers black. The beers were good and refreshing.\"\n",
      "The best part about this brewery is the prices. This is one of few places in center city you can get craft beer for less than five dollars. This place is mostly clean and well kept  and very nicely air conditioned on hot summer nights  something I was grateful for the night I went.  Along with their own beer they do serve wine and spirits as well  with a reasonable cocktail menu to match. I happened to just stick to beer  and from what I experienced their beer is generally quite typical.  I'll start with the bad  Dark Money  their saison  is extremely forgettable. It is not too spicy or salty like a typical saison  and while it is tart it is not a great specimen. Their oatmeal stout  Belgrave Crescent  starts out well enough but ends on an extremely and uncharacteristic bitter note that left a lingering terrible taste in my mouth.  There is good as well though. The Goldenrye has a nice flavor that is very crisp and has pleasant mouthfeel. Sticky Icky  their double IPA  was probably their best offering. It is slightly sweet but not cloying  and has the perfect amount of kick an IPA should have without being too bitter.   I would come back here. That being said  I'm not dying to come back here and probably wouldn't go out of my way for more of their brews. If you're in the area and like craft beer  then by all means check it out. There isn't anything extremely unique here  but you might find a decent brew or two on tap.\n",
      "This was my second time coming here.  First time was only for drinks after Dave Matthews concert in Camden.  I am in town this week for work so decided to come here with a co-worker.  I had the Peel Jam IPA.  I loved this IPA.  Liked the grapefruit  orange peel flavor.  Just the right amount of fruit taste.  Would definitely order this beer again.  For dinner I had the Fig and Pear salad.  Salad consisted of arugula  Asian pears  blue cheese  and an olive oil fig vinaigrette dressing.  The portion of the salad was perfect  it was exactly what I was looking for  for dinner.  It was light on the blue cheese  which is what I prefer and the dressing was amazing.  Really glad that I ordered this.  This place has a cool laid back vibe.  Will definitely be back.\n",
      "Asparagus flatbread  Briscuit poutine fries  pretzels ... oh and the beer! All fabulous.\n",
      "The place gets one star for the bartenders.  Very rude and won't get your beer until they finish their conversations amongst themselves. Actually  look annoyed to be bother by a customer the people they are actually suppose to be there to serve and pay their wages. I got one small beer and decided not to eat because how crappy the service was and how rude the bartenders are. I couldn't even get the check to get out of there. I will never go back. They have no knowledge of the beers and seem annoyed to be there.\n",
      "Horrible service.  Manager ran away when questioned about order.  When she finally checked on status  never returned for update.  Hot dogs should not take an hour.  Will never return and would not recommend.\n",
      "Let me first note that the food and the beers were very good! My issue was all about SERVICE.   This was our 1st time @ 2nd Story. Our hostess sat us down with menus.  Our waiter Kieran asked us if we were ready to order. Dude!! We just sat down! You got a great selection of beers  lemme soak it all in or maybe you could suggest one or two?  We asked for a few min to look it all over. 20 PLUS min later I grab the waiter as he's passing by us to place our order. We order beers  drinks  a couple apps and main courses. Apps come out  we dig in. 5 min later  main courses come out. Table is now jammed with everything at once. Waiter drops off bill. That was the last we saw him. Lol  A dining experience shouldn't be hurry up and wait and BAM  here's ALL of your food. Work on the pace. Don't rush your diners as they just sat down. And don't forget to come back to take the order!!\n",
      "\n",
      "A group of us wandered in after having a great time on the Big Red Bike Tour.  We sat in the back and ordered some beer and apps and had a great time joking around with each other.  Our server seemed ready for quitting time and not happy about having customers come in  even though the place was open for another few hours.  Everything was average at best (food  overpriced drinks  atmosphere) and nothing here stuck out as special. I'm somewhere between 2 and 3 stars  but because our server was such a party-pooper  I'm going with 2.\n",
      "Went on a double date here and had a great experience! The food and drinks were delicious and decently priced. Even though 2nd Story is known for their beer  I got some kind of fruity margarita and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with french fries and that hit the spot as well. At the beginning of the meal  we found out it was our waitress' second day on the job  but she did fantastic! Definitely recommend trying this place out.\n",
      "Using a touch screen to order? Genius! I'm a picky eater so being able to choose exactly what I wanted and not having to worry about anything unwanted in there was a plus. Also  for those who gets flustered when being asked too many questions at the cashier  you're okay! Everything seemed fresh and healthy  wasn't a heavy lunch overall. Great concept  good food. Finally glad I got to taste this place!\n",
      "Solid lunch spot for sure  they are always busy and there is reason why people keep going there.  I prefer comfy  rustic ambiance over modern and fancy. And rather order my meal old fashion way over vending machine. Honey grow reminds me of cafeterias in Japan or HK. I get overwhelmed with all ordering through machine and it isn't so much fun for me.. Salad is delicious though but I like to put a lot of topping to make it yummier and m salad is usually around $12 and still doesn't fill me up!\n",
      "Eh  I don't know how much I liked it here.  I read that it can get crowded.  No problem  I'll go in at 2:15PM  after the lunch rush is over.  That didn't work.  When I walked in  it looked like a mosh pit full of people.  There's really no clear direction on where to stand or if there are lines or what goes on here.  I had to ask the people standing around me to figure out what to do.  People were standing all over and right over the people sitting at the tables  which is annoying for those who are seated.  I guess it's pretty convenient to put in your order on a touch screen and pay right at the terminal with a credit card.  It makes it fast  but that is where fast stops.    I was with one of my coworkers who had a strict 30 minute lunch  timed by a time clock.  Unfortunately she wasn't even able to order and get her food within this timeframe....at 2:15PM.  It's not like we walked in at 12:00 PM on the dot.   We both ordered stir fry and I ordered the honey bar.  Cute idea  but if you get both  it's going to cost you.  Almost $17.00 for \\work lunch\\\" seems like a lot to me.  After my coworker had to leave  I stayed and waited for our food  which finally came out.  It would also help if they displayed the numbers as they came up  so you'd have some type of idea of your place in line.  The honey bar was good but not filling.  The stir fry was pretty tasty!  I liked the sesame seeds and fresh jalapenos.  Maybe if I call in my order ahead of time  I'll come back sometime.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been here twice so far  and I just absolutely love it. I love the concept of \\build-your-own-stir-fry\\\" and this place does it so fabulously.  The ingredients always taste fresh  and I love all the options and the variety. The process is pretty quick too-- just select what you want through a monitor and your order will be ready in just a matter of minutes. My favorite part is all the sauces they offer. Everything sounds so good that I want to keep going back just so I can try all of the sauces. I also love that they have egg white noodles- so delicious!   The one thing I'll say is that it is kind of expensive. The portion sizes are not humongous  and you kind of end up spending more than you would have imagined because you pay for the base and then pay more for additional ingredients you want added. With an extensive list of amazing ingredients and toppings  it's hard to restrict yourself!  Will definitely be coming back. In love!\"\n",
      "Today I stopped in around 12ish for lunch and decided to get a salad. One of your employees  I believe her name was maya is a great asset to your restaurant. Her customer service skills and timing on making my salad was on point. If everyone works as fast as her I'll definitely be coming back :) btw salad was delicious!\n",
      "\n",
      "This concept rocks and so does this particular location when you're looking for an alternative to fast food or fast casual. The make-your-own salads are fantastic and full  love topping it w falafal  and I have become a fan of the lemon tahini and green goddess dressings!\n",
      "My absolute favorite lunch spot--started going to Honeygrow in the spring and have eaten there at least once a week ever since. The line is frequently out the door to order at one of the kiosks but it goes quickly and the food is also prepared with a very short wait. I have to say I LOVE the kiosk style ordering  especially when doing a create your own salad or stir fry. It's easier and less pressure than yelling ingredients to someone and trying to see everything that's available.  I've gotten salads and stir fry here and love both. I recommend the wheat or egg white noodles over the rice ones for stir fry and love the five spice soy sauce. Salads are equally enjoyable and there are tons of fresh and natural ingredients.  One of the things i am most impressed by at honeygrow is the staff. For one thing  they make great quality food with care while being quick about it at the same time. Also  they all seem really proud of the food. Someone is stationed in the dining area who goes around making sure the customers are enjoying the food and helping people when they don't know where to go to pick up their meal.\n",
      "I miss my MSG! OK  make that salt. The touchscreens are a nice idea  though I can imagine the line they can form during rush hours. I ordered a stir-fry and a smoothie  and the thing that struck me wired  was that my smoothie was served at one end of the counter  and the stir-fry ended showing up at the other side of the counter.  Seriously now  why can't they just be served together  don't really care where on the counter- left side- right side or middle  but I found this a little bit confusing.\n",
      "Sunday morning in Philly equals finding a good place for brunch  so we recently went to Kraftwork with friends.   The staff were very friendly and quick with water and menus.  My girlfriend had an egg omelot with a side of sausage and I had the egg breakfast with side of hash and house made scrapple as well as a homemade biscuit.  The scrambled eggs were quite good. The house made scrapple was something very different and tasty. Although  I still couldn't get my girlfriend to try it  it was quite better the usual scrapple on offer in diners. The side of hash was good  but deep fried. I may be old fashioned  but I prefer the potatoes fried on a griddle with onions. Finally  the biscuit was light  fluffy  and very delicious with the jam the restaurant had.  My girlfriend seemed to enjoy her meal. Although at first the side of sausage was undercooked and had to be returned.   In the end  it was an interesting experience and I would like to go again in order to try their breakfast burrito.\n",
      "I wanted so bad to love this place. The idea of it seemed so great. But Kraftwork is the definition of hipster  seems really cool at first  then you realize it's trying soooo hard to try not to try so hard. The decor seems so cool  but then it becomes stark and uncomfortable  like sitting in the middle of an unfinished cafeteria. The menu is so unique  but the food is just not very good. Thought this would be a cool neighborhood spot...but cool neighborhood spots just are  without trying so hard to be.\n",
      "Love this place!! The menu is so plentiful and awesome  just what I needed after a night out. We went for lunch and I got the burger (added caramelized onions  provalone  and bacon) it was delish! A very hearty burger  it was more like a giant meatball and a little messy to eat  ok a lot messy to eat  but well worth it.  The fries were overcooked but I was so full after the burger I was thankful to not eat all of them. My fiance got the breakfast Cubano which was also very tasty! The pork belly was nicely cooked  topped with egg  I really liked it  I always welcome unique menu items.  We also had plentiful bloody Mary's and their custom mix was a little different tasting but I welcome that in a bloody  rather than the same old.   Overall definitely a place to check out  nice cozy interior  friendly people  worth a stop.\n",
      "Kraftwork comes from the same folks as Sidecar in G-Ho  which means excellent brunch  above-average gastropub fare  and one of the best curated tap lists in the city.  Adam  the friendly owner  will best help you select a brew of your liking  but the rest of the staff are knowledgeable as well. I dig Kraftwork's more open  industrial  communal aesthetic with long tables  a big center bar  and metal accents everywhere. Brunch is on point (and with a sub five minute wait during peak Saturday hours)  the fluffy  buttery biscuits and not-excessively-rich gravy hits the spot with a perfect portion and deft seasoning. The tofu scramble misses the mark with watery cubes of tofu but redeems itself with very tasty veggies and crispy potatoes.  Dinner doesn't fare quite as well. My Kraftwork burger was cooked past my desired medium rare  though still had a decent amount of juice and a tasty  dry-aged beef funk. Long hots  though scantly portioned  are a delicious sweet and spicy topping. Fries are crispy  garlicky  and addictive with a dijon dipping sauce. The falafel's house made wrap and condiments taste great  but the dry  mealy fritters kill an otherwise enjoyable sandwich.  For now  I think of Kraftwork as a brunch destination rather than a dinner option  but regardless its blend of great service  atmosphere  and kick-ass beers have won me over.\n",
      "I came here on Thursday 19th May 2016. It was a nice day and my friend was over visiting from Russia. After a walk around the neighborhood.   We settled on Kraftwork because we were close and they had tables outside  LLoyds didn't.  I  had a burger with fried egg on top and my friend had the beer can chicken sandwich. Everything came out in a timely manner. My friend said his  beer can chick sandwich was good as was the salad. I had the blandest burger on earth  Fries were super seasoned and warm.  We were finished( well my friend was i didn't eat mine) when the server came over at which point we had to be moving on so I never got the opportunity to get something else.  So I did tell Jenna the server and she apologized Etc we did get half off one dinner because of an included coupon to all guests although I was not there to save a few bucks.  Still I thought the duty manager could have came over to see what was going on and how to prevent it happening in the future Etc  I am a local and have eaten drank here several times before  mostly average to good quality.  There is plenty to choose from in Fishtown and if if you can't get a burger right then people will go elsewhere (sketch make a great burger  up street from Kraftwork) I can't say I'll be rushing back especially when I have friends in from out of town  there's just too much good stuff to choose from without having to settle for an average unseasoned burger.   I should have took a pic of the the freshly delivered burger egg and fries  it did look pretty good ....\n",
      "Went here last night for a few beers with a friend.   First off  the staff is extremely friendly. They knew a lot about the beers and answered a few questions I had on some. The bartender (Mike?) was quick to offer me a sample of a couple of beers I was interested in trying.   Their tap list is amazing and constantly changing. Prices for the area are pretty damn good.   I'll be back for sure.\n",
      "Wow!  Can't belive I had such a bad experience here. My expensive 16oz craft beer was  maybe 12 ounces of liquid with a massive head that was mostly deflated by the time the beer was served. My Bahn mi sandwich came with a big piece of fat in it. By that I mean it was a piece of fat in a long roll. Disgusting. The waitress gave me the \\I am more important than you\\\" answer when I asked her about it. My girl's fries were soggy and overcooked but her overpriced hamburger was fine. This is not the first time I have eaten here  but after a year we thought we would give it another try.  What a mistake!  Trust me when I say I we will never go back!  Go to any other place that's just within walking distance and you will be happier.\"\n",
      "I fall more in love with this place every time I stop in!  Whether it is a quiet weekday lunch  dinner with friends or a late night stop-in with my boyfriend  the food/drinks/service are always on par.  My boyfriend and I tend to get the beer sampler every time we go since they are constantly rotating beers here. I have had their other drinks too and they are delicious as well.  The food here hits all of the marks and the menu really caters to every palate. I've enjoyed the portabella melt as well as the pork tacos. The salads are creative and different which is a nice change from most bar offerings. The deviled eggs and the pretzels are out of this world.  What really sets this place up for success is the service. Everyone is friendly and accommodating and works hard to make sure you are satisfied. Recently I stopped in on a Saturday and sat at the bar  and the bartender (Jon) was super sweet and friendly. He made great beer recommendations and was there to help us when needed him.   This is my new go-to spot in Fishtown area  and I am pretty sure it will stay that way for awhile :)\n",
      "Good gastropub. Went here for brunch got biscuits and gravy with eggs. All tasted top notch. I also had a hot toddy. They garnished it with cloves stuck into a lemon wedge  really original. I've gotta try that myself. I went on a Saturday around 1pm and it was packed but there was no wait to get a table regardless. Good spot  cool atmosphere. Definitely worth hitting up next time you're in fishtown.\n",

      "Came here after reading about their specials in a Top Happy Hour in Philly list - the place was further away than Center City  but was definitely worth it!   We came here in a group of 4  and ordered every food item off their happy hour menu. The first item was a tofu salad that I would recommend skipping - even though it was really fresh tasting and well seasoned  it was completely overshadowed by the other dishes. I really liked the caterpillar pork bread - the roasted pork filling was amazing and the slight sweetness of the bread lends itself really well to the combination.   In terms of drinks  we ordered a family pitcher to share and it was a huge jug that would be more than enough for 4 people. The flavors were definitely unique and Asian-inspired.   Definitely would recommend for happy hour - and they conveniently have weekend afternoon happy hours to get your fix of dumplings!\n",
      "Bung bung!   I'm hooked!   I recently came here with a few friends for Happy Hr.  Fresh off a train ride  I was starving.  With little to no parameters  my good friend chose this spot.   From the great tunes to the awesome decor  Bing Bing excites the senses.   While here I had the Tiger Style Punch.  Very strong.  It's the sipping type of drink.  Any punch bourbon based is always the good kind of trouble.  From there I had  Pork Soup Dumplings ( by far my fave...so savory and deelish)  Everything Paco Man Bun (basically their take on Bagel and Lox)  Roasted Pork Bao (pastry was light and the pork was seasoned greatly)  Crispy Cumin Lamb Rolls ( flavor punch in the mouth)  and the Sweet & Savory Brussel Sprouts ( I wanted another order).  In addition to all that  I took advantage of their 3 buck Miller Lite.   :)   I cannot wait to go back again!\n",
      "Chow fun  soup dumplings  pastrami bao were all quite awesome\n",
      "Got the caterpillar bread and pork bao bun. Pretty great stuff! Decent prices. Would def come here again! Small place but was able to sit at the bar no problem. Small beer selection but when you're serving Jai Alais  what more do you need? I'll be back!\n",
      "Everything my girlfriend and me had was great. We got the beef dumplings  soup dumplings and spicy cucumber salad. My favorites were the soup dumplings and spicy cucumber salad.\n",
      "\n",
      "This placed REALLY knocked my socks off! Not only was their food incredible (you MUST get the bao buns and cucumber salad) the staff was kind and attentive. I was visiting from out of town and our server even recommended some great places to get ice cream in walking distance. Such a great location  and excellent music created a great vibe. Perfect place for date night  dinner with friends or the place to go with your parents in town.\n",
      "So  so very loud. We were literally shoutung at each other across our table. Food was okay but our dishes arrived weirdly  all my dates first then all mine later. Typical East Passyunk hipster staff. I don't know what expected from a dim sum place  but it wasn't this. I won't be back. Our waiter was a young kid  who apologized for how the food came out and seemed like he knew the dishes well.\n",
      "What I love about Bing Bing is they have a good happy hour on the weekends. I got the chef's cocktail which was a lychee gin mixed drink that was very refreshing without being too sweet. While the dumplings we ordered were pretty good  what really stood out to me was the roasted pork bao  which was delicious! I think Bing Bing describes itself as Jewish Chinese fusion but I would say  at least with the food we ordered  it's Chinese South Philly fusion. The bao was basically a roasted pork sandwich in a bun. The atmosphere is great as well  it's loud and vibrant  but also intimate  probably because of the size of the restaurant. Overall it was a fun experience.\n",
      "I got a table last minute on a Friday night.  It was one of those spontaneous evenings when everything just happens to work out perfectly.   It only took twenty minutes to park the car right next to Bing Bing in a perfect spot (so lucky)  upon arrival my friend was seated at our table:).   The staff is extremely friendly  attentive  and accommodating.  My friend felt sick  so they replaced his drink and gave me a second one to replace his.  My two cocktails were delicious.  I can't remember their names  but I remember one had jalapeño and one had some pear flavoring meshed with a bunch of others (the latter was my favorite).    Foodwise  we had the beet dumplings first (little bites of heaven...could have eaten twenty  but stuck to ten:).  The pork soup dumplings were spot on.  My friend had the lamb dumplings of some sort?...(he loved them).  We also had some epic kimchi fried rice (so good).  My entree was the brisket noodle soup (more than enough for two  but I housed it solo).  Best meal I've had in a while.  Loved everything about Bing Bing.  Can't wait to come back and sit in one of the great looking booths.  Definitely  make a reservation.\n",
      "I gotta give it 5 stars ! Even though they lost our order and they brought the food like an hour after we arrived   they charged us only one of the burgers and let me tell you that chorizo burger was worth the wait! Amazing !\n",
      "Good ambiance  prompt and attentive staff and brunch was fresh and delicious. A very nice spot  which probably gets hopping at night.\n",
      "Lucha Cartel gets a five-star rating for decor.  Part gothic  and part lucha fighting.  Very fun!  Daughter and I had the pico de galo and chips (just ok).  Daughter had the tacos  which she described as \\as expected  just OK.\\\"  I had the shrimp on a bed of sweet plantains.  The shrimp with mango sauce were a little tough (overcooked?)  but the plantains were divine...bringing me back to my time in central America.  The $5 happy hour margaritas are light on alcohol  but pretty good (5-7 PM).  I would probably try this restaurant again  as it's so amusing.  But I would try some other food options.\"\n",
      "Came here for a casual dinner before a weeknight movie.  The decor is kind of artsy-funky with a hint of grunge.  We only got food  so can't comment on the drinks.  Our calamari appetizer was out of this world! Lightly grilled and very lemony  the texture was absolutely perfect.  Our entrées were pretty lackluster though.  The sweet potato tacos were tasty but small for the price.  The crispy fish salad was under-dressed and generally forgettable.  The service was good  maybe we'll be back for happy hour.\n",
      "A pleasant surprise!! On my birthday weekend a friend and I planned to go to National Mechanics for their delicious veggie burgers!! When we arrived we discovered it was closed until 9pm for a private party!! Although this was a bummer we had to think quickly  our stomachs were growling audibly! I remembered walking by Lucha Cartel and thinking I wanted to try it  luckily it was just down the block and around the corner from where we stood.  The mixed drinks  chicken tacos  margaritas and giant salad we ordered were all delicious!! This place wasn't crowded for at Saturday at 7pm-- good or bad depending on how you look at it! The ambience  decor  light and music were excellent! Which leads me to believe the universe knew better than I did how I wanted to celebrate my birthday!! We found out this place has the same owner as National mechanics... Tricky tricky! Can't wait to go back!\n",
      "\n",
      "Love this place  amazing happy hour from 4-7. The staff is friendly (Adan was my server and he's great)  the food is good I love their pork tacos and queso fundido (both $5 happy hour) and their MARGARITAS are soooooo good. Check this place out.\n",
      "Went here for dinner while visiting philly for a couple days. Coming from the Chicago area. The Pork Belly tacos have a lot of meat and pineapple flavor. If your looking for a protein infusion the tacos are the way to go. They do not come with rice or beans which are 3$ each extra :/.  The chicken quesadilla has loads of cheese and TONS of chicken.   Decent prices  lots of meat. Would recommend it if you are into Mexican food.\n",
      "Awesome place. Awesome staff. Great place to go for food and drinks. It's even a cool bar to go to at night if you get a good crowd.   Margaritas are BOMB\n",
      "Love their Nachos!  Fun staff  good music  great drinks!!! Decor is awesome!  Check out the Mexican wrestler last supper painted across several skate boards! Can't wait to visit this spot again!\n",
      "Went here with the homie Shannon. Had the vegan cheesesteak. It was good but it was a lot of bun. Fries and beers were on point  I had a cider of some sort.  They had a nice big list of beers on special. They have the menu up on chalkboard and was told they change their menu often  so will be going back in the future. We sat at a booth that had cool lights in the table that changed color. Parking is kind of tight but usually something on Frankford. Divey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor quality food overall.  We had a chicken caesar salad and a lamb pasta special and neither was acceptable for a restaurant.  The lamb pasta dish was a little cold too  like it had been sitting in the kitchen for a couple hours.    Despite poor food  the location on the corner was good and the tables right on the street were nice to sit at.    I would return here for beer and music but I'll never  ever  eat here again at any price.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this place. I have yet to come see a show here  but every time I come for drinks with a group of friends we have a great time. The atmosphere is cool and the drinks are good.  Why the two stars? Unfortunately  every time  the experience with the service at the bar is very frustrating.  I've obviously been to crowded bars  and I know it gets hectic and it can take a while to get the bartender's attention. At JB though  each time  I get the impression the girls behind the bar are purposely being rude. I've stood there trying to get their attention  while they reorganize the ketchup bottles behind the bar.  From now on  my strategy is to send my boyfriend to the bar as it seems guys get the bartenders' attention more quickly. And I'll keep my tip until the attitude changes.\n",

      "I must say  I've become quite smitten with Johnny Brenda's.  I think the only place where I'm more likely to be found is in my own house.  And  ok  maybe my boyfriend's apartment.  Maybe.  I've mostly used Johnny Brenda's as a place to have a few beers while checking out a show.  The upstairs opened last fall and since then I've seen a good number of shows.  I haven't been disappointed by any of them.  The space is what I consider to be a perfect size for a show.  There isn't a place in front of the stage where you'd have a bad view  and it's a wonderfully intimate setting.  The beer selection is pretty fabulous (as you would expect from the people who also own Standard Tap)  and it's also reasonably priced.  Both things I greatly appreciate.  The bar kind of has multiple personalities.  Downstairs has all the hallmarks of a local dive bar: the floors are linoleum  the tabletops are always sticky  and there are even a few neon lights.  I love it.  Then you go upstairs where the floors are all hardwood  the bar is well designed with accent lights everywhere  and there's even a partial third floor balcony overlooking the stage.  I love upstairs even more.  I also have to give my vote for Best Women's Bathroom to the 2nd floor of Johnny Brenda's.  There are more stalls than you could ever need  there are multiple mirrors (including a full length).  Also  the lighting  sinks  and fixtures are gorgeous.  Now I just need to get in on some of that brunch.  Man  do I love brunch.\n",
      "This used to be my favorite bar.   Seriously... It was every-evening-after-work-sitting-at-the-bar-alone-with-a-book-and-eating-some -scrumdiddlyumptious-fried-shrimp-and-drinking-tasty-brew favorite.   The food is still really good (though not 5 star good anymore)  the drinks are still reasonably priced  and the staff is still nice. But since they added the upstairs  expanded into the building next door and added a brunch  they've become too busy/popular/trendy for their own good.   It's still a really fun place to go  especially if you like crowded nightclubs filled to the brim with hipsters and indie-rocker wannabes. But I really miss the simple drunken joy of the old JB's.  Oh yeah  the modified Budweiser sign over the juke box made to say \\dive bar\\\"  no-longer applies.   EDIT (May 7  2008):  I just went there last night and found out that the Yard's Philly Pale Ale is now $4.50... that requires me to take away a star. If the rest of Philly starts charging more than $3 for a Yard's  then I will give them their 3 stars back.  Maybe not. I doubt I'm going back (unless an awesome band plays a show there).\"\n",
      "I love this place! The food is so good from dinner to desert A+ the booths are cozy and with the windows open you can't ask for a better night. Service is right on  great selection of drinks.\n",
      "I have been here at least a hundred times for dinner and/or drinks over the past 5 years. I feel as though I have watched it fluctuate as far as it's food quality is concerned. It's a hit or miss  sometimes it's fantastic and other times  I'm let down.   Because of dietary restrictions I feel the menu is quite limiting  wish there were more veg/vegan options  not a place I can frequent as much as I'd like but it definitely hits the spot when my stomach growls and I'm not feeling cooking and washing dishes!\n",
      "Revolution is not my favorite place in the city  but it is a good option in a neighborhood that can be over crowded and overly intense.   The food isn't amazing (the sandwiches are HUGE and on cose-like flatbread  they are very generous with the cheese  so don't expect anything light) but they have a solid tap list and lots of outdoor seating (both sidewalk and roofdeck!). I enjoyed a salad and some nachos during a first friday and it was great people watching eating on the sidewalk table.\n",
      "Finally had an opportunity to take my wife to Revolution House after our yelp event (actually my our first event) and a few solo stops myself. Their Craft beer selection is very good and constantly rotates so I had a Clown Shoes Galactica along with a Neshaminy Creek Tripel which went well with an order of housemade Tater Tots to share along with Mini Meatloafs for me and Eggplant Parmesan for my wife. Very Good!\n",
      "Amazing food. I mean top of the line in all areas  meat  veggies  pizza and even the fries are brag worthy! The atmosphere is fun to hang out at. The service is bad  I mean really bad. Inattentive the entire time I was here. You will go thirsty here.\n",
      "Came here with five friends after checking out the art galleries at First Friday. It was a good place to just chill with friends.  We each got a \\small dish \\\" such as the baked Brie or Mac n cheese. The Mac and cheese was good but was nothing special. My friends said the baked Brie was amazing.   We all checked in on yelp to get a buy-one-get-one-free deal for beers. Most of the beers were $6. So $6 for two beers was great.  Overall  I had a good experience here. But it was nothing extraordinary.\"\n",
      "We were attracted by the roof deck  but when we went it was too hot to sit outside.  So we sat at the upstairs bar.  The atmosphere was nice.  The bartender was friendly.  But the drinks were extremely watered down  and the food was mediocre at best.  Pizza (ham and arugula) was excellent  but the artichoke was way over-cooked  the dumplings - eh  and the \\yam-based\\\" tater tots had no trace of yam that I could see.  We left to find a $10 drink that actually had booze in it.\"\n",
      "My husband and I like to go to Old City for happy hour before we see a show at the Arden. Revolution House was our most recent spot. The timing was perfect as it was a gorgeous day and Revolution House has a roof deck and happy hour specials.   We ordered our first round of beers at the upstairs bar and took them to a table on the roof deck. There were about 8-10 beers on draft and the selection is pretty decent. For happy hour  all beers are half off. We were pretty happy campers with a Long Trail IPA and Dogfishhead Indian Brown Ale. We ordered our second round (same beers) and food from the table. The roof deck isn't the most spacious but it's a roof deck and they are a sparsity in Philly.   The happy hour food special was half off a Margherita  pizza. The pizza was okay...I guess no  real complaints for $6. The crust was light and flaky but the sauce and cheese were inconsistent. The sauce wasn't evenly spread and there were a few blobs of mozzarella scattered around the pie. It was topped with basil but the basil had been baked in and was a little dry/crispy. I prefer my basil fresh and added to the top of the pie at the end of the cooking process. The pie was a decent size and did the trick for a snack for two people.   The service wasn't bad. We had ordered our first drinks at the bar then seated ourselves potentially causing some confusion. It took a little bit of time for our server to come visit our table. It was smooth sailing for the rest of our visit and the rest of the service was prompt and attentive.   I wouldn't make a trip across town just to go to Revolution House but if I'm in that part of the city  I wouldn't hesitated to go back from happy hour.\n",
      "Very friendly staff  they brought ice water for my dog and refreshed it with new water later. The chicken sandwich is great  and the watermelon mint soup was very good and refreshing on this warm day.\n",
      "The food was good but the staff were rude. I was on a double date with good friends and we got there late evening 8:30 ish. We had food drinks and spent about $180. The bartender closed us out and gave us last call before midnight  which seemed odd in Philadelphia  and by 12:15  she and her staff were visibly annoyed that we hadn't left. She was spiking her tip change into a collection box  one penny at a time  and we were constantly being stared down for not leaving. It was very rude and a sour note to end our expensive evening. Not worth a revisit.\n",
      "I like rooftop decks  so Revolution House gets an automatic 5 stars.  However  they start losing stars when they charge full price on drinks to sit on said deck.  It's a gorgeous summer evening at 5:30  the colleagues and I don't want to sit inside at the bar  so we swallow our cheapness and sit outside anyway.  The menu sounds good  but is executed poorly and is borderline too expensive ($11 for a tiny little quinoa salad?).  The fancy brick oven pizza was decent  but no match for Zavino or Stella.  The homemade tater tots are actually delicious  compiled of a variety of potatoes.  My colleagues had the lasagna cupcakes and artichokes  which they said were really gross (especially the artichokes  normally made with butter  were floating in some oily concoction).    We went back for my birthday happy hour last week and sat inside at the upstairs bar this time (heat wave!)... the bartender was super attentive and gets extra points for letting 15 of us take over a bunch of tables and most of the bar.  Overall I like Revolution House for drinks  especially because they have prosecco by the glass  but they definitely need to improve their food and lower those prices!\n",

      "I am obsessed with this place! They have great and quick service. Great place for a affordable  good quality and quick bite (carryout service available ). I always get the fish of the day and it never disappoints.  Today the perch was great but my favorite is Mahi mahi. Love this new addition to Callowhill businesses!\n",
      "This is my second time at Buena Onda  and I'm ordering my favorite dish--the Mahi Mahi tacos. I live in California where there are plenty of Fresh Mex restaurants  but Buena Onda has the best tasting fish tacos hands down. The fish is lightly grilled  moist and seasoned just right wrapped in fresh tortillas  garnished with pickled relish and small thin slices of avocado. The tacos are served in a taco holder which makes it easier to pick up and relish every bite! The restaurant itself is bright and clean  quick service and friendly staff. There are other menu options besides fish and the prices are cheap--fish tacos are at $3.50 per order.\n",
      "Would be firm 4 star place  but the misses were plenty.   Let's just get it out of the way  the tacos are pretty legit. I eat at the taco trucks and the down and dirty corner stores and these are pretty good. The restaurant did right by not pricing themselves out of this market. It is a tad pricey  but i think it is worth it--$3.50 per. 3 = $10.50. Mexican places hover around 3 for $8-9  so the price point isn't too far off.   What separates and warrants the additional pricing is the finished product compared to traditional Mexican spots. Instead of just the meat being center attention  there are Buena Onda has additional garnishes that elevate a typical street food.   I ordered: -fried mahi mahi -carnita -carne  all were pretty good but the winner by a mile was the mahi mahi. I used the red hot sauce (in the jar  not bottle)  so i can't review the green one. The red sauce was really nice  added more flavors to the already flavorful tacos.  Here were the misses...  1. my cousin and i ordered 4 tacos. Cashier rang up 3.  2. we ordered 2 modelos. Cashier rang up 2 modelos AND 1 CORONA 3. we showed him the \\rewards\\\" program to get discount. Cashier never gave discount.   When we paid  i was wondering why it was so high (expecting the discount) and why we got a Corona? Our order was not complex...we did not ask questions. Just put order and paid. I defended the cashier saying \\\"they just opened  must be oversight\\\". BUT  my cousin believes he was high while on the job. OH well.   ALso  i'm not sure how their system is setup because all 3 tacos came out on one tray. What if two people share 3 tacos like i did? I had to ask for another tray  which wasn't a problem  but inconvenient considering we ordered \\\"separately\\\" but paid all together.\"\n",
      "This place is absolutely fantastic. Please know that I am Latina and Hispanic (from Argentina and lived in northern Mexico) and I am sufficiently impressed. I ordered their Atlantic Mahi mani tacos which were incredibly fresh and prepared with a variety of ingredients that made the flavors just pop in my mouth. The service is excellent and I also love the fact that they serve beverages that are non-alcoholic and traditionally Mexican (aqua de tamarindo and aqua de Jamaica) as well as red and white sangrias  and Tecate  Corona and Modelo Especial and they have a nice variety of Margaritas. So far I have only tried their classes  but look forward to enjoying the prickly pear one next time.\n",
      "Great Tacos. Cozy atmosphere. They have happy hour and taco Thursdays. Staff are friendly. Affordable. I think I'll be a frequent visitor.\n",
      "My profe introduced me to this place. You have to get the fried fish tacos. they are the best  first time was the best time. A Mexican Taco without cheese.\n",
      "We had the house specialty fish tacos made with Atlantic Mahi Mahi and a side of black beans. Since this was my first time eating fish tacos  I've nothing to compare them to. They were really good  but I think I liked the side of black beans better! The service was great. Clean establishment.\n",
      "Tried this out for lunch yesterday. Let me start by saying the food was good. I had three tacos--Mahi Mahi  pollo  and carnitas.  They were deliciously prepared and the (what I presume to be) homemade sauces provided great extra flavor. They also have Boylan's fountain soda which is really just to die for.   And now  the airing of grievances (Seinfeld style):  1. The tacos are pretty small considering the price (about 4 a pop). I guess that might be so you can sample a selection of the offerings but no one wants to feel they're not getting any bang for their buck.   2. It doesn't seem like there's enough seating to accommodate a lunch crowd. The turnover was fast enough and it wasn't an issue for my crew of four but I could def see it being a problem.   3. There's at least one discrepancy on the menu (tecate is either $2 everyday or $4.50 depending on where you see it) that annoys me because I think pricing should be straightforward and clear. It just seems to me the error allows for a loophole of charging customers more if they're not looking closely.   4.  Lastly  the power situation. While we were there yesterday  there was a power outage. I'm in no way blaming that on Buena since it appeared to cover a few blocks in the surrounding area but  the way it was handled by the staff left a lot to be desired. Namely  they just said \\sorry folks\\\" and watched as diners attempted to wait it out or customers who hadn't placed orders yet filed out. I would've expected some sort of customer retention effort. After about 10 min of no power (windows allowed plenty of daylight to see)  no updates  and increasing heat since the air conditioning was off  we left  too.   Take away:: a good option if you're looking for a bite in the area  are not committed to eating in their dining area  and bring your reading glasses.\"\n",
      "So  I've been craving tacos lately like crazy and it's super hard to find a taco place that caters to pescatarians in my area. After finding this place while doing a search for shrimp tacos  I decided to try it this evening with my family members.   The restaurant is fast casual style  so you go up to the register and place your order either dine in or to go and if you're eating in  they give you a placard with a number to place on your table.   I ordered the shrimp tacos  one tequila lime style and the other fried. My sister ordered a quesadilla  my brother the nachos and my boyfriend got the tequila like shrimp and fish taco. The food came out pretty quickly  we waited maybe 5 mins.   I was a little nervous because I was super in the mood for tacos and did not want to be disappointed  and I really wasn't. The food was absolutely amazing! It was fresh and the flavors weren't so overpowering  which allowed me to really enjoy the shrimp. My family really enjoyed their meals too.   Definitely coming back again when I'm craving a taco!\n",
      "We had lunch catered by DiBruno Bros.  and the food is very solid.  The sandwich platter comes with the chicken pronto (mozzarella  pesto  greens  and chicken on a baguette)  roast beef  turkey and brie  and caprese.  I loved the caprese  as it came with plenty of fresh mozzarella  a great pesto spread  and sliced tomatoes.  The garden salad was very standard but the creamy  oil-based roasted vegetable vinaigrette was fantastic.  The pasta primavera with white fusilli and vegetables tossed in a white wine vinaigrette was also very good and not overly tangy.  The dessert tray of brownies and cookies was also a hit and I was definitely a fan of the rich fudge brownies.  Overall  a great gourmet catering option for a small to medium group.\n",
      "This is my single favorite grocery store on earth. Fantastic place where  years ago  I first discovered Truffle oil and then later: truffled honey.  Once  (before my diet was Kosher )  I bought  prosciutto to make prosciutto wrapped dates with blue cheese dressing. This prosciutto project (\\Project\\\") was on like attempt number 3 at this point  I had tried bacon  figs  Gorgonzola- none of it was what I wanted (and no  I wasn't perfecting the dish for a dinner party  I was just trying to make myself the perfect snack.)  I had worked on the Project extensively one Saturday and that evening a boy and I went out for dinner and drinks.  When we got back to my place to play records and continue the sips  I told him that he could take the prosciutto home with him because it was simply too salty for the Project. As was the trend in those days  we became intoxicated.  In an effort to try to stay sober  he made multiple trips to the fridge  and ate all $53 worth of prosciutto that was in there. (Looking back I wonder what the heck kind of personal appetizer Project requires $53 dollars worth of anything?) And he also reported that   though delicious  prosciutto does not help sober anyone up  he might have been successful if it had been a potato based food.  Di Bruno Brothers was the secret behind many many of my best dishes when I lived in Philadelphia- they ALWAYS have the right ingredient and more often than not they have a spectacular ingredient that inspires the creation of a new  unexpected dish.\"\n",
      "3.5 stars for dibruno brothers.   they have great (always presentable) cheeses  desserts  pastries  and gourmet groceries. Also  on the side  there is a counter for fresh meats and fish. props for their consistency.  For a gourmet grocery store  I expected the service to be a little more prompt. I waited at the bakery for about 5 minutes before anyone asked me if I wanted anything. I don't expect to get served ASAP  but if I am standing there  I generally think its good customer service to have someone ask me if I need any help.   I get two mini cakes at $6.50 a pop.  They were really not amazing tasting cakes. I got a mini chocolate cheesecake and fruit tart. I've had better fruit tarts at grocery stores. I think they fill the tart with a cream of sorts (perhaps whipped?) instead of custard  which is what they offer at other places. I live for fruit tarts  so I was pretty disappointed that I threw away $6.50 on a mediocre fruit tart. The fruits on it were beautifully glazed in sugar  but the taste was quite dismal.    The chocolate cheesecake was better  but not by much. It was a layer of cheesecake wrapped between chocolate cake.  If you are looking for a birthday cake try Miel Patisserie.  For the price  I expected more from DiBrunos.   The pastries at the coffee counter are pretty good here.  They have a great cinnamon bun. It's a little too sweet  so definitely split with a friend.\n",

      "I really enjoy coming in here for random novelties. They have a decent selection of bottled water ranging from American artisan water (yes  artisan  not \\artesian\\\") to tasty Italian brands. Sometimes I even find my favorite Italian cookies here (Abbracci by Barilla). Oh! They also have chicken pot pie to take away! I remember when I had a serious craving for some and I couldn't seem to find it anywhere! I came here and ended up leaving extremely happy. And yes  it tasted delicious!  Overall  I don't come here for much  but when I do I'm pretty satisfied with my purchases! The staff is very courteous  especially the older man behind the counter next to the drinks (he always greets customers). I also needed a band aid once  and the security guard went and got one for me. I truly appreicate such assistance.  My only warning is that if you want to get lunch here (particularly during lunch hours)  don't come if you only have 30 minutes. The line appears endless!!\"\n",
      "If heaven is a place on earth  then Dibruno's is it.  I love all of the sights  smells  and sounds of shopping here.  The cheese and bread are to do die for.  The homemade gourmet sausages are some of the best I've ever tasted in my life.   The only downside is that the prices will break your piggy bank.\n",
      "As much as I love dibruno bros  the price point has finally gotten out of control. Today I ordered a very conservative portion of vegetable lasagna. To my bewilderment when I got to the counter to pay the cashier said without hesitation \\that will be $17 (SEVENTEEN) dollars\\\" I said but  but  it's just one piece of lasagna!!!   After setting up a payment plan for the 3\\\"x3\\\" piece of lasagna  I was in shock.   FAQs 1. Was it the best lasagna I've ever had? No. 2. Do I regret it? Everyday. 3. Was there a $10 bill actually in the lasagna? NO!  After finishing off the costly dish  I thought about what else I could have spent $17 FREAKING DOLLARS on. A few things came to mind 1. 3 VHS copies of Home Alone 2 2. Two 10-packs of Hanes socks 3. Helped a small child in a third world country for just 69 cents a day for 24 days. 4. 3 twinkle tushes (look it up) with money to spare!!   Idk diBrunos  y'all got some tasty snacks but $17 for a piece of lasagna?\"\n",
      "We stopped in to see about healthy lunch options and were very impressed with this excellent deli market in central Philly.  Our biggest gripe is that the selection of organic foods is very limited...  So... great market deli and lots of really great food - but mostly not organic unfortunately... maybe that's something they can look at for the future as not everyone wants to eat GMO!\n",
      "Great sandwiches for lunch and quality produce. Very  very friendly staff.\n",
      "this is such a beautiful space full of beautiful food. definitely not a place to regularly grocery shop unless you pull at least 6 figures a year but a must-visit store to appreciate how pretty food can be.  i'm sure this place is spectacular around the holidays.  bonus: many affordable gluten-free options (mineral water+small garden salad+pre-cut fruit = roughly 11 usd)\n",
      "I deducted one star because the service was not great. Our waiter wasn't friendly at all. The first question was \\soup or salad \\\". I wanted to order appetizer and lunch special  but he assumed we were having lunch. Seaweed salad was really good. Shiomay was small but good. The sashimi was fresh. Banzai roll was great and unique. Raw salmon and white fish with avocado and fish egg wrapped in cucumber with some sweet sauce. Perfect for those who is looking for no-rice roll. Salad dressing was more like carrot purée.\"\n",
      "Zero stars for the Chicken Teriyaki Lunch Bento Box.  I have literally never seen a bento box come without rice before.    Disappoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surprised this place is rated so high. I love sushi. With a name like crazy sushi I was really hesitant. It's kinda like any place who has a weird name like that is a red flag but the reviews were so good I figured what the heck. The sashimi I had was a large portion  but the tuna was clearly dyed as it was so red it was nearly purple. I didn't touch the salmon. The bonsai tree roll that is wrapped in cucumber was soggy. The spicy tuna roll was stuffed with filling hardly any rice. The yellowtail roll was pure flakes and no fish. The miso was good though. Fresh and a good amount of miso. I asked for extra ginger  was on the receipt  and received none. So if you want miso check out if you know anything about sushi pass. Delivery was an hour  I was told 20 minutes. The guy on phone had me screaming my order it seemed really busy and he was super rushed. Pass on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place has some of the best sushi I've had in the city  hands down. I've been on the hunt for the best sushi in philly and this one may be it.   The service is great. Super friendly staff  great lunch specials as well. My schedule is off a lot of days so my  lunches can start late but this restaurant stays open all day which I like. Many other spots close after lunch and don't open again until 5 or 530 for dinner.   Overall  great food  great staff  nice environment!Recommended\n",
      "Brought my friend here for her birthday because it is very hard to find a place that serves sushi on a boat! This place didn't have it but I know they decorated their plates nicely so that's not bad either!  Our waitress was very nice and wished her a happy birthday once she saw the Happy Birthday balloon. She even came out with fried cheese cake with a candle and started singing happy birthday at the end!  The birthday girl had the Bloomingdale Roll $13 which was spicy tuna  spicy salmon  spicy kani  spicy yellowtail and spicy shrimp avocado with longan on top. It was good but I'm not really a fan of the pink seaweed thing. I asked the waitress if they could write \\Happy Birthday\\\" on her plate and they did. They even added a little tree and made it look like a little island!  My other friend ordered the Cancer Roll $15 which was spicy tuna  seaweed  salad  eel  masago  soft shell crab. They drew a bird on her plate! It was so cute!  I had the M16 Roll (sounds like a gun) $13 - eel tempura with spicy tuna rolled in black and red tobiko (fish eggs). It was yummy! And they decorated my plate too! I had a little tree as well.  The service here was great  the sushi was pretty good  the environment was nice and I will be back!\"\n",
      "Good food  though I felt like the portions were smaller than I was expecting for the price. I'm surprised that other Yelper's rated this two dollar signs. I also wish they'd had gluten free soy sauce. Other than that  there is really nothing to complain about and I still was able to enjoy my meal.\n",
      "We were visiting from LA and found Crazy Sushi on Yelp. Probably the best presentation of Sushi I have seen. We ordered sashimi  a peacock roll and unagi...delicious!\n",
      "This in my go to sushi place in center city. The food is always fresh and tastes good. My go to is the Kano crunch house special roll. It comes covered in spicy mayo and crunchy caviar on top. I recently discovered the ak-47 roll which comes with shrimp tempura  cream cheese  avocado  and a special soy paper on the outside. It's very good as well. For appetizer I love the rock shrimp which is covered in a sauce similar to spicy mayo and drizzled in soy sauce  it is crunchy and amazing. The California roll I would say is pretty standard compared to other places. They also offer a lunch special on weekdays!\n",
      "Great pizza + great beer= Fantastic local Brewpub!   The salads are great  and the pizza is inspired and tasty.  They even have a vegan pizza (with pesto  veggies  and tofu) that my Vegan friends love  so we can all enjoy a dinner out.  That's saying something!\n",
      "By far the best pizza I have had in Philly  and this is said after living studying working in Italy on multiple occasions over a number of years.  High quality ingredients consistently prepared to perfection.  I am also not a big beer drinking  but almost always take advantage of sharing a beer flight with a friend during the meal.  Perhaps my only complaint is that they are not located in CC  though that might be better for my waistline. Either way  looking forward to going back for sure.\n",
      "I would consider this to be one of the best local bars restaurants in town.  I think they have quick service and really good pizza.  I am planning on visiting again soon.\n",

      "Dear Dock St: please please get some not-disgusting wine! I come often. Your pizza is yummy  your burgers are so tasty  and everyone says your beer is good  but I don't can't drink it. I want to come more and I would  but no liquor and disgusting wine makes me sad.\n",
      "Dock Street is probably my favorite place to get pizza and beer. I used to be there about once a week when I used to live in West Philly. Nowdays  Nomad Pizza is closer and is an acceptable alternative  but my wife and I still make it out to DS from time to time. Our favorites are the Fig Jam and Flammenwhatever pizzas. My one stickling point is the beer selection  but maybe that's because they used to spoil me. During the era of the first 2-3 brewers  their beer selection would have earned them 5 stars from me. It was creative  and rotated on a regular basis. Now they always seem to have the same core beer offering  with an occasional new beer rotated in and out. Don't get me wrong  the beers are good  but the lack of change removes some of the incentive to go back regularly.\n",
      "Fresh brick oven pizza made to order and house brewed beer  what else could you ask for.  The prices are totally reasonable and I love the neighborhood feel too.  Dock street is that perfect place to go when the rest of the city becomes too boring or you get tired of the \\usual haunts\\\".\"\n",

      "Went here tonight with the family. Atmosphere was great. Love the way the place is set up. I'm dissappointed with the quality of the food. Service was great. The staff is very inviting.   We order the calamari. It was chewy and hard. The marinara sauce was good. We orders two chicken dishes. Chicken was a lil on the dried side and over cooked. Not tender and juicy at all. The lobster ravioli was watery inside. Which was tasteless. The last dish we order was the veal medallion like dish. It was just ok.\n",
      "This place blew me away  such a hidden gem!  Amazing food  wonderful service  and a very charming atmosphere.  I took my friend here for his birthday  I booked the table on OpenTable and mentioned it in a comment.  They not only took the time to read the comment but wished him a happy birthday when we sat down  such a nice personal touch!  Great wine list too!  I will definitely be back  again and again and again!!\n",
      "Boyfriend is an Italian food lover  so we had to choose an Italian restaurant for restaurant week. We ended up choosing Bistro Romano and man were we glad we did.   First  the atmosphere. The actual dining room is below the entrance in a brick lined room that looks and has the feel of a wine cellar. It sets a very cozy and romantic atmosphere  perfect for a date night.   The staff was magnificent. Service was perfect and our waitress was very friendly and helpful with her suggestions and recommendations.   AND THE FOOD. Oh the food. My boyfriend's absolute favorite food is gnocchi  so of course we had to try the white truffle gnocchi. Between the creaminess of the sauce  the saltiness of the prosciutto  and the texture of the gnocchi  this was the most well-balanced dish I have ever tasted. Boyfriend and I both agreed that this was the best gnocchi we have ever had (and he gets gnocchi A LOT).  Everything else was also very tasty  just not as tasty as the gnocchi lol.\n",
      "\n",
      "Came bc of a groupon deal and we enjoyed our experience.   Service was good  and the place was cozy. It fits in the historical society hill atmosphere. Bread was fresh  but crackers were a little too salty. I ordered the seafood paste  mahi mahi  filet mignon  and salmon entrees. and it was a good pick. Food/sause was good in general  but I would expect more if I paid for regular price. It was an enjoyable dinner.   street parking will be hard to find.\n",
      "\n",
      "Came here while visiting the city. Enjoyed it very much. I got the veal  which was delicious and the Caesar salad. It tasted just like my homemade Caesar salad which I guess I a good thing  but they prepare it table side which is a nice old fashioned gesture. The ambience is very romantic and the service was great. The music is very cliche- Sinatra  dean Martin etc but adds to the mood.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been coming to this restaurant for years  so I figured it was high time to write a review.  I have never been dissatisfied with the service here.  The lobster special on Tuesdays has become one of my favorite special occasion bookings.  But as I'm sure other reviews can attest to  the atmosphere is unmatched.  Probably one of the most romantic restaurants in Philadelphia.  And I know it's popular  but it will always feel just a little secluded ... like its Philly's best kept secret.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great sushi place! My boyfriend and I went for Valentine's day and had an excellent dinner. We're used to ordering several rolls  and we did not anticipate how large the rolls would be (they're pretty large). Everything was delicious. Neither of us tried sake before  and the waiter was very helpful with suggestions. I decided I am not a sake fan  but I was happy to give it a try.   Beyond the food  the restaurant has a fun atmosphere! I highly recommend this restaurant.\n",
      "I expected better. Based on other reviews I was willing to go with higher prices in exchange for some really good sushi  but honestly it was disappointing. The money part is not even really a factor in my review since I was there on business expenses.  The interior of the restaurant is very nice and the menu seemed interesting. I had no problems with the service  as others have reported. Immediately as I was seated I was asked if I wanted a drink and it was brought over immediately. After ordering  my sushi came about as quick as I would have expected anywhere else.  I ordered three rolls (I'm a big eater) - the rainbow roll  soft shell crab roll and \\dark horse\\\" roll  which was a eel based roll that was deep fried. Presentation on all the rolls was very nice. The dark horse roll was advertised as having a spicy sauce drizzled on it  but to be honest it was just flat and bland - not much flavor at all. In fact  none of the rolls had much flavor. Even the wasabi seemed bland - I dumped the entire dollop into the soy sauce. I started getting the feeling that maybe my taste buds died  but I verified that they were still in working order afterwards with some dessert elsewhere.  I don't visit Philly that much  but I'm pretty sure if and when I do return I won't be in a big hurry to come back to this place.\"\n",
      "Went to a party in their hidden outdoor space. Hard to find outdoor spaces in Philly. You walk through a doorway between buildings  and the space opens up in the middle of the block. Great vibe. The sushi was pretty good  with interesting drink specials.\n",
      "I have been to raw twice  and both times I was only at the bar. The bartenders are great. They were helpful  and attentive. Their sushi was good  but a little overpriced for what it was. I had fun but I wouldn't come back for a meal.\n",
      "The place has a great atmosphere and ambiance. It's a modern looking contemporary style restaurant.Perfect for dates.  The food was very good. I had a green tea   which tasted very good! To eat we got some Makis. A Black Horse and a Salmon one. The black horse is pretty big and is made with eel! I loved the taste!   The price was fair for a japanese restaurant trendy like this.  If you stay with the Makis you won't spend as much as some of the reviews say.    Overall  the experience we had was very pleasant. The only side note is that the tables might be too close to each other and can break the privacy a bit.\n",
      "This is a review of their happy hour only. I've never eaten dinner there and the plates that were being passed around to some of the tables looked pretty decent  so maybe the food there is actually really good.   I went there with a friend right before going to see a show  and we ordered one of each of the four happy hour food specials to try. We got four of the tiniest California rolls I have ever seen for $3  which was not a deal by any means since you can normally get 8 pieces for $6....Same with the spicy tuna roll. The steamed shrimp shumai were each about the size of a Rollo candy and had no actual chunks of shrimp in them  and the pork gyoza tasted like deep fried versions of the Trader Joe's gyoza at $1 per bite. Pretty disappointing to say the least...  My friend liked her Pink Bubbly  which tasted pretty refreshing  but we also couldn't taste any alcohol in it. Needless to say  we won't be back for happy hour ever again.\n",
      "Really terrific sushi. Served fresh and with great presentation  Raw has a pretty decent sized menu  and the chefs are always accommodating when it comes to tweaking rolls. It is a bit on the expensive side  but that is expected of a trendy Center-City restaurant. My only real gripe is that the service can be lacking at times  usually during the weekends when the place is packed. But even that is easily forgiveable  given the top of the line eats.\n",
      "Visiting Philly for a friend's birthday & she had plans of going to the Mexican restaurant down the street. We show up at 6:30 to the Mexican spot and it quickly becomes clear that there was a misunderstanding regarding reservations & were now out a plan for my friend's 10 person birthday dinner. The entirety of the street is expectedly filled up with waits & reservations. We're screwed..... we start walking towards a bigger street when we lose some of our group that accidentally went the wrong way. Thank god they did because soon my friend calls and says 1222Raw or whatever the name of this place is was able to accommodate us. We were nervous walking over but the second we step foot into the beautiful entryway everyone's stress went away. We waited for about 20 minutes and then got sat in the back room where we were able to share one long table and have lots of privacy-- turned out better than we could've expected! Alex was our server and he was friendly and patient with our hungry group  and went thru his favorite cocktails several times for those of us who were indecisive. Our group split the table so half of us split a bunch of small plates and the other half ordered for themselves. Alex was happy to create two separate checks which saved us a lot of time and effort when paying. Cocktails were yummy and strong  food was flavorful (pork gyoza & pork belly buns were awesome apps and the fried rice ROCKED.) They even brought the birthday girl fried green tea ice cream at the end of our meal (one of my friends said that they had run out of candles and went to buy some just for this!!!) Honestly so grateful we stumbled across this place & I would definitely recommend it for large groups. Thank you to the staff for making my friend's birthday dinner easy & special!!!!\n",
      "This was my second time at Raw and I have to say I will not be coming back. We ordered the Royal Sushi  which was a combo of sushi and sashimi. The rolls were decent  but overall the quality and freshness of the fish was not great. Maybe it was because we went on a Monday  but the fish was definitely not the freshest.  Although the service and ambience was nice  we will definitely be checking out other sushi places in the city.\n",
      "I loved this place! The staff were friendly  the food was good. Great happy hour menu. What else can I say? This is a must stop by the next time I am in town. There were other places in town. I'm glad we chose here.\n",
      "One star because of the experience (which I'll get into in a second  believe me you want to keep reading) TL DR  this place BRUTALLY killed a MOUSE in front of my friends and me (using 3 different methods - fire  stomping  whacking with a broom)  Would have been a 2 stars regardless because of the food.  #1 red flag was the fact that it was cash only bc the credit card machine was being 'shipped' from California  ok fine bc it had at atm machine there.  #2 was when we asked about the Unagi vs fresh water eel don  the waiter said the menu is messed up but they're actually the same item (?) the Chinese translation definitely wasn't the same and they're very different types of fishes.  #3 we asked for the ginger milk tea and was told we could get 30% sweet but then the waiter comes back and says they can't do it bc they use a ginger sugar (lol  ok)  #4 they asked if we needed our tea pot to be refilled and we said yes but the waiter took it away and never came back with it until we asked multiple times. ANYWAYS  with all of that said  the food just wasn't good  I had one piece of the eel and stopped eating and chucked it. The chirashi was just ok as well as the Taiwanese chicken. The calamari was too breaded and couldn't taste the squid inside  the rolls were too small and the waffle with green tea wasn't good. My friends and I really have NOTHING good to say about the place despite us going over the food/any redeeming factors over and over.  Now to the finale  this is what happened: 1) Friend notices a mouse in little space between outside and inside door  2) We get grossed out but took a picture of it and immediately notified the management  3) Management came over to take a look and ignored it for a good ten mins 4) Some bald guy goes outside with an iPhone (for light) and a FLAME THROWER (the kind you use to melt the top of creme brulee and tries to burn the poor mouse (WHY COULDNT YOU JUST USE A BROOM TO SHOO IT OUT as the first solution instead of trying to light it up?!)  5) Man lights up the mouse's tail but mouse is too scared to leave (duh) 6) Man opens up the door and starts to use a broom and mouse runs back and forth and doesn't go outside bc it's hiding behind the ATM machine 7) Another guy comes out with a broom and tries to shoo it out and still it's not budging. 8) Finally mouse runs and the bald man traps it in the corner with his foot. Then he STOMPS ON IT 3x!!!!!! Instead of holding it with foot and just shoo it with the broom bc he was so pissed. 9) We record all of this and get super grossed out and sad that we thought they killed this little animal unnecessarily  BUT THERE IS A TWIST AND IT GETS WORSE. 10) Other man tries to sweep mouse out to street and mouse starts trying to run bc it turns out that the mouse was only seriously injured and not dead 11) THE MOUSE IS LITERALLY ON THE STREETS ALREADY  the bald man chases after it and whacks it repeatedly AS HARD AS HE CAN until it's dead. 12) The mouse is dead with its guts on the street now and he sweeps it to the mounds of garbage bags. PURE Brutality? I'm not a mouse lover but this story sounds pretty shitty  right?  HEY BUT GUESS WHAT THE STORY DOESNT END HERE.  13) The second man comes into the restaurant and has the NERVE to come over to us and says VERBATIM 'hey  the mouse came from the outside  not the inside. I saw you recording  can you delete...' I CUT HIM OFF right away. I said also verbatim 'what's on our phones is our property and we will do what we wish with it  please give us the check' Ok #1 what makes you think you don't need to apologize for us witnessing all of that? #2 why do you think you can ask us to delete our videos and pictures?! Doesn't even make sense!!!  THEN ON TOP OF ALL OF THIS  they gave us a measly 10% off our bill thinking it'd be ok. We aren't asking for a free meal nor did we ask for any of this but if you're gonna comp anything  10% is nothing. Please. A measly small apology when we were still at the restaurant before we just left.  I posted all the pics/videos as soon as we walked out  and have gotten an email from the owner. My friends and I have discussed at full length (like actually 1+ hour) on what to do and we decided that it was best to let the Yelp community what happened. It made us super sick  disgusted  and really upset after we left because of what we saw. Definitely one of the worse restaurant experiences we've all ever encountered. Not ok.\n"

      "They've absolutely improved in the last year.  They have an official website now!  The fish was super fresh  the chirashi bowl was delicious and well worth it (12-13 pieces of sashimi)  tuna princess roll was delicious and well done!  I do agree with most people that their teas are sweeter than expected so I went with 50% sugar and it was perfect for me (side note: I don't like sweets too much  so it may depend on how much sugar you like).  Definitely our new place close by for sushi!\n",
      "We were so excited when \\A\\\" brought this little diamond in the [extreme] rough to our attention. Our mouths watered all day at pictures of Instagram-Worthy drinks and beautifully plated sushi. Alas  we couldn't control ourselves and set out to Bubblefish.   Unfortunately  it was not quite the experience that we anticipated. Bubble fish is either understaffed  under-experienced  or some combo of the two which left service to suffer.  Judging by other reviews  we can assume that the service is much better when they're less busy.   Chinatown is becoming an increasingly popular area for weekend nightlife  so if they wish to compete with the Dim Sum Garden's and Banana Leaf's of the world  they're going to have to get it together when things get a little busy. Lucky for them  their drinks  sushi  and young  hip atmosphere give Bubblefish a fighting chance.   **note: CASH ONLY** Overall Ratings (1-5) Service  1 Ambiance  3 Specialty Rolls  5 Drinks 4 Onigiri  3 Taiwanese Salted Chicken  1 Experience  3  CONs  1) We didn't get water until at least 30 minutes after being seated despite multiple attempts.  A manager (such a sweetheart) hinted to a shortage of glasses so at least it wasn't a result of poor customer service.   2) Our 'Taiwanese Salted Chicken' was a tad suspect... It seemed a bit dark. We weren't sure if it was supposed to be dark or the result of old oil. However  more alarming than the color was the texture of the chicken. The internal temperature was about 10 lucky seconds past salmonella paranoia-- a bit gamey to say the least. It reminded us of $5 General Tsos from the local Panda Express  minus the Tso Sauce.   3) The staff seemed a bit disorganized and may want to consider investing in an electronic reservation system so that each server knows exactly what tables are theirs to focus on. Openable is absurdly expensive but management should totally check out SeatMe by Yelp!  4) Our server (at least we think she was our server ... it wasn't very clear) came to our table TWICE within our brutally long  2.5 hour dine-- once to take our orders and once to collect her tips. \\\"J\\\" was certainly not her biggest fan  although  to giver her the benefit of the doubt  she didn't seem all that experienced. Either that or she just sucked?  5) They don't have enough seating for groups of 5 or more  so things were a bit cramped. Our 5 person party was placed at a table that was definitely made for 3-- 4 if you're lucky.   PROs  1) The sushi was pretty darn good-- our favorite being the Bubblefish Roll. The price and the portions were perfect for 5 greedy  broke college students. There wasn't too much rice  and they really loaded on the fresh fish!   2) The drinks were sooo yummy!! They measure up to the pictures in every way.   3) Our subpar service was not overlooked by one employee in particular. We think she may have been a manager or the owner. She gave us a sincerely warm apology without us having to bring anything to the staff's attention.\"\n",

      "I strongly recommend this place to everyone! Very comfortable atmosphere  delicious food  and reasonable prices!  It's a great place to hang out with friends/family.  Upon request  they have a separate  room that can accommodate private parties! I gave this restaurant five stars because not only is the food amazing  but you can tell that they are really putting in the effort to please the customers as I have found a lot of restaurants don't care nearly as much.  I have been there several times since their grand opening just a few months ago.  I highly recommend ordering the Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup. It tastes amazing and it's not as salty as most can be.   Absolutely you should try their Bubble teas  the sweetened just perfect for me   not like other bubble tea stores that I have always to ask 50% less of sugar . especially sea salt froth green tea with Oreo Crumb on top that you must try. I also love their sushi. It's very fresh and not many places can say the same!  Trust me on this review!  You will NOT be disappointed!\n",
      "First time came here i fall in love  best restaurant at chinatown. Sushi was great  fish are fresh and always have special fish every weeks such as fresh oyster and live uni. Have lot of choice of bubble tea. Compare all the bubble tea house at chinatown  have alot of option that cant make u boring everytime u come here.\n",
      "I visit Chinatown frequently and try to look for new places to eat. Bubble fish has been open for a bit so my husband and I decided to try it this go around. We had a few questions on the menu since it was our first time. When we asked our waitress about some of the items she answered with one word without any details to help us make a decision.    We ordered the Taiwanese crispy chicken which was ok. The seasoning was not mixed very well. You could see loads of seasoning on one piece of chicken but then none on the other. My husband had also ordered the honeydew milk tea since the restaurant is known for its teas. It was chalky and lukewarm  not iced  so it definitely didn't live up to its hype.  We ordered three sushi rolls and they were all mediocre. The rice was mushy which made the entire sushi piece mushy when eating it.   Our waitress also consistently reached over us to grab items like our menus  plates  etc and never asked us how we were doing. And because she never came to check to see how we were doing  we went to pay at the register. Unfortunately  the workers at the register were distracted by talking about other customers that it took a long time to get their attention so we could pay.   Overall  we were not impressed and disappointed that we weren't able to experience what gives this place its ratings.\n",
      "Memorable place. Love it. I had lunch there with a lovely girl  I enjoyed the meal. The food were served in a sufficient amount. And food was lovely  too.\n",
      "One word - underrated. Sure  the spotlight outside might be trying to attract attention  but for me  it was a calling. Overall  this is a chic and casual japanese restaurant with comfortable seating  upbeat and sick music  an impressive menu  and late hours (open till midnight  1 AM on weekends).   Let's start with the drinks. There are various \\bubblefish specials\\\"  from which I tried the lavender oolong milk tea. It was delicious  substantial  and the boba was soft and chewy. They also use lactaid milk for their drinks (shout out to all the lactose-intolerant peeps). There are at least 3 pages of drink options to choose from  ranging from oolong teas  black teas  green teas  hot teas  juices  milk shakes  and smoothies. While it was just my first outing  looking at the other drinks from surrounding tables  I was tempted to order more...  For food  I tried the tonkotsu don  taiwanese beef noodle soup  and a couple of specialty sushi rolls. The tonkotsu don is a helluva dish - you get a big pork cutlet katsu (perfectly crunchy on the outside with juicy meat) upon a bed of white rice sitting in a castiron. Great value meal at $12 and filling. The beef noodle soup was rich and had great flavor. However  they use thin beef slices (which were kind of tough) instead of the traditional beef chunk cubes. The signature sushi rolls have plenty of flavor  mainly because they often come with tempura  some avocado or fruit  and a miso or spicy mayo sauce.   Of note  they also have \\\"Bubblefish boxes\\\" (around $13-14)  which come with a protein teriyaki of your choice  with california roll  shrimp and vegetable tempura  vegetables  and rice. I saw a few tables that ordered these boxes  and they looked massive!  I would definitely check this place out  there is bound to be something on the menu to make a great meal for anyone!\"\n",
      "It's tough review to write and if I ever go there again I will update it. We were in Philly for a concert in Tin Angel and were short on time with no preplanned reservations. The places we wanted to go were all booked so we stumbled in here. We were seated at the bar. The place is pretty big with a few rooms  a little ran down in my opinion & could use some TLC. The atmosphere in the room with a bar was not cozy and it was pretty dark ( ambiance at the bar 2) The service 2 1/2 stars  - not refilling water  not picking up dirty plates etc but they were pretty busy and service was not slow.  As far as food  in general it's pretty good and depends on what your expectations are. Menu consists predominantly of pasta and some veal dishes etc No lasagna though. They have specials every day of the week. I loved their free caponata to start. At the suggestions of the waitress I ordered grilled calamari as it is their popular dish  it was ok but nothing to write home about. Fried mozzarella was really good as well as veal porcini. Vegetables cooked just right with slight crunchiness. Gnocchi with asparagus sauce were melting in your mouth and if you are fan of gnocchi you'd love it. Obviously  don't expect it to be healthy  after all it's Italian and sauces are pretty greasy. Generally  I had mixed feelings about that place. I would not specifically chose this restaurant among all options in Philly these days but it worked for us at that moment and food was quite decent in taste. I would probably give them 3.5 but there is no option like that and 4 at that visit would be too high in my opinion.\n",
      "Great food and service.  If you park across the street  pay for a permit a the machine in front of the building.  They hand out tickets every few minutes.\n",

      "Arrived early for our 7pm reservation and was greeted warmly and seated swiftly. That combines with the two great drinks we had is the only reason this is getting two stars and not one.   We took advantage of the restaurant week menu. $35pp and you pick 1 app  entree  and dessert (anything) and get and pasta! Sounds pretty good  well it is if the food is good!  We choose the grilled calamari and crab cake. The calamari had absolutely way too much \\char\\\" taste to it. It absolutely overpowered any flavor the calamari could have had. It was like someone who learned to BBQ for the first time and went crazy with the fire! When the crab cake came it was next to a salad that was brown. TBH  it looked like the bag salad when it starts going bad and you throw it away. The crab cake itself was ok. Nice size and not too much filler. I think we enjoyed that see much because that ended up being the only dish we liked. So that's not saying much.   The penne pasta that came next was ok. Pasta of course was cooked al dente. I mean  if they couldn't at least cook the pasta right we would have probably left right there.   Entree time. The bass filet topped with crab. There is no way you can tell me that fish was fresh. I tasted frozen for days! Straight out of the freezer and not even the individually wrapped fish. The fish that's frozen and lumped together with freezer burn. Totally tasteless! All the veggies again....somebody was happy on that grill. The potatoes were the only thing ok to eat.   The ravioli with 4 cheeses  mushrooms and spinach. This dish was not was rich and flavorful as you would imagine a 4 cheese dish and a sauce obviously made with cream should be. 6 raviolis  I ate 1 to taste....2 to be sure I wasn't crazy. Left the rest.   Dessert~ I took the cheesecake. Sure you can't mess up a cheesecake too bad. The jello no bake cheesecakes are even edible.  BF took the mousse. There are levels to cheesecake delicious-ness. This cheesecake was edible. He did not eat his mousse. You ever had tho use Hersey pies. Well  nothing wrong with those pies  but he doesn't like them and if he knew that's exactly what it tastes like he would have chosen different.\"\n",
      "I went to this restaurant with my parents on a Friday night.  We had a 7:30 reservation  arrived on time  and were seated and served promptly.  We split up the grilled calimari as an appetizer.  It tasted delicious and was served with a thin buttery sauce on the side.  The portion size of this dish relative to its price was not good  however.  I know it was only an appetizer  but it really was not a lot of food  even for one person.  They do serve a complimentary basket of bread with a squash type spread with dinner  though  which was a nice touch.  By the time the entrees came we were definitely not in a bad spot.  For dinner I had the chicken parm with a side of spaghetti  and I have to say that both were terrific.  The spaghetti was obviously prepared fresh  and the sauce was perfect.  The chicken was thin and crispy and was obviously a quality cut.  Delicious  really.  The portion size was pretty much perfect.  By the end of dinner we were quite content  but not too stuffed to turn down dessert.  After dinner we split up a dessert sampler  which was absolutely perfect for 3 people.  It had smaller cut up pieces of VERY fresh cannoli with a chocolate sauce  tiramisu  cheese cake with a graham cracker crust and strawberry sauce  and a chocolate mousse cake.  Though all of our entrees were excellent  I think we all liked this part of the meal most.  With coffees  which were very smooth and not weak  this dessert put a nice exclamation point on the meal.  The service was fantastic  by the way.  They seemed to always check in at the right times  kept our glasses full (with fresh ice/glasses without me even requesting it  which would have been a cardinal sin if they did not)  and were very friendly and down to earth.  They made you feel right at home.  The decor is slightly better than average.  For a place this solid  you'd have hoped for a little more  but it had a nice charm of its own.  On the whole  entrees range in the $20 range.  For three people  splitting up 3 entrees  an appetizer  1 drink each  and desserts/coffees  the bill came to about $135 total  after tax and tip.  Of course this one was on dad anyway  but the place is very fairly priced if you aren't being treated.  I'd be happy to go back here on my own dime  and very happy to go back here if it weren't.\n",
      "Amazing find. I am surprised this place is not rated higher on yelp. Huge portions and very tasty food. My wife and I split a portion each of Arancini and Gnocchi with Bolognese. Both were incredibly flavorful. The entree was a touch on the filling   heavy side  but hardly a reason to complain :-) in addition  we loved the caponata they serve with the bread. Will be back!\n",
      "Another great group dinner at Spasso.  We visited Philly several times over the past few years over Memorial Day weekend and we always make a dinner reservation one night here.  Authentic Italian cuisine  delicious and with excellent service.  Their antipasto platter which includes grilled and fried calamari  prosciutto  insalata caprese  grilled veggies and more is wonderful.  The selection on their menu  in addition to their daily specials is extensive.  Their wait staff is very good at helping you navigate through it to help you make choices.  Their selection of wines is also extensive and reasonably priced.  I highly recommend Spasso  it's a can't miss.\n",
      "Great atmosphere. A little older crowd. Pricier but worth it. Crunchy bread comes with sautéd veggies and oil. The grilled calamari is fresh and cook perfectly with a delicious sauce. The Seabass comes cooked to perfection which the waiter can fillet for you upon request. The seafood risotto comes with a healthy portion of calamari  fish  and jumbo shrimp and just may be the best Italian dish I've ever had. The sauce was amazing!\n",
      "My take on Italian is that most of the  time its-too heavy  thick..but I was surely impressed by this place  as it came highly recommended by good friend who is Italian. We went here Friday night  in wintry mix.. My friend knows the owner & his fiance very well..He said that the veal  also this bean & arugula dish was great  so he got side dish of it. Their homemade pasta was De-vine. I ended up with Veal   asparagus  & artichokes  roasted veggies & potatoes. The veal was auctious  light & moist!! It didn't sit heavy at all.The interior was rustic  brick walls  had that Tuscany feel.The restaurant was huge  he was able to add on: extra room seating  bar  now an area they can catering (banquets)that was closed off.. Would I go back  I think so..found myself  Completely in shock how impressed I was with the food & quality here .The service was very good as well.   Return Factor: A Definite!!  See if the are consistent.\n",

      "Probably the best tasting banh mi option in Chinatown.  While I've gotten others with more meat and or vegetables inside  it's the flavor of the bread and the ingredients that will draw me back for more. It's a tad on the pricier side for these types of sandwiches  but the mother and daughter running it are sweet and there's decent room to eat inside the restaurant.\n",
      "Hooooooly cow.  Never had such an awesome sub in my LIFE!  I live in New Jersey and happened upon Q.T. one afternoon while visiting some family.  I'm honestly depressed that they only have one location.  Hands down one of the best sandwich shops I've EVER visited.  Oh and the people there are just amazing.  So warm and friendly!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have worked my way through the menu twice now  and I can comfortably say that this is my favorite Vietnamese Sandwich joint in Philly.    Like all of the reviews say  the bread is fresh  the ingredients are delicious  and the ladies who run this place always take your order with a smile.    I keep finding myself ordering the lemongrass tofu  but if you want something a little more adventurous  the special is unlike any other sandwich in the city.\n",
      "I wasn't overly impressed- seemed the price was a bit high and the meat a bit skimpy. I got the House #1 special and it was flavorful- but I'm used to a lot of meat on my sandwiches.  The lady was super nice and service was fast. But I wasn't feeling the meat love.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the top Bahn Mi sandwiches in Philly. I had the BBQ Banh Mi sandwich - the BBQ pork  pickled carrots and the crispy French roll were so delicious. My son had the Bun Rieu which was spicy and true to style with crab broth and noodles. He sweated through every spicy spoonful  but he said it was so worth it. The owners are super friendly and many regulars stopped for lunch at this favorite spot in Chinatown.\n",
      "\n",
      "The house special was amazing. It's refreshing  tasty  not heavy  and I could eat like five.\n",
      "Hands down the best Bahn Mi in the city!  I'm a regular (even though I almost always forget my punch card :- . ). I've been to pretty much every Bahn Mi place in Chinatown and off of Washington Avenue in S.E. Philly  and while I've had some great rolls in a few of the other places  overall you can't beat this one.  The cherry on top is the family members who own and run this business proudly are genuinely genuine!  I'd recommend any one of their choices.  Enjoy.\n",

      "It is 8:01on 12/17/2014  and I just got off the phone with the rudest woman EVER. I simply called to see if Grubhub's 1 hour and 45 min delivery estimate was right for my food.  She went into a tirade acting like I was the biggest inconvenience ever  about how they use a 3rd party delivery service and all they do is make the food so she can't tell me.  I say ok  thinking to myself why is this lady being so hostile? She offers to see if they made my order and I said that would be nice.  She confirms it went out and then says  \\Bye \\\" hanging up on me while I'm trying to thank her.  Honestly  if you don't want to deliver  than don't.  Or at least tell your employees that it's part of the business model  and they need to treat ALL customers the same - respectfully.  Because guess what  if I don't get delivery from you guys  you won't get my business because I never go in to the restaurant.  There are plenty of other places to get delicious burgers from in NoLibs now.\"\n",
      "Soooo much food!! Really easy to accidentally over order... Get the Mac and cheese! It was fabulous. The vegan burger was really heavy but tasty especially with the horseradish cheese! Make sure you bring your a game to draw your most creative burger... As for mine  fail.\n",
      "Absolute joke of an establishment. I order a burger w/ fries  and when I get home and open up my food I see that neither the fries or top bun of my burger are there! Like seriously  how idiotic are you that you forget these things!?!? Plus the food itself was like $16 which is a complete ripoff. I guess when you're selling to delusional hipsters in Fishtown you can justify charging that but to us normal people that's absurd.   Bottom line: don't waste your money at this piece of s**t restaurant.   Make America Great Again.\n",
      "Absolutely the best burgers ever. We tried the Kobe burger with wasabi  the smashed onion burger and the truffle burger. The fries are amazing. Maybe the best we've ever eaten. The Macaroni and cheese is awesome. And the desserts . . . well you get the picture. The biggest problem was that we all ate too much.\n",
      "Sketch is one of my favorite spots in Fishtown! I've been here with my partner 3 times and we've never been let down. The atmosphere is cool and low key  and the people are super friendly. The burgers are incredible!! I haven't explored most of the menu because i'm hooked on the burger. They are tasty and big. Most of the sauces are good too  and the bun is outstanding. My girlfriend gets the black bean burger  and loves it. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone interested in some local  non-pretensious eats.  The chipotle and aioli sauces are our favorites.\n",
      "Woah  who knew the burgers would be so gigantic! Well I had a good idea  but seriously...  I think next time I will split a burger because it was a challenge to eat it all. It was just too delicious to waste  so I forced myself to enjoy the whole thing. I had a regular burger with the horseradish cheddar  bacon  and sauteed onions. I was very pleased that I could actually taste the cheese  because sometimes cheese can get lost in the mix of flavors. The roll was fresh  and the burger was cooked just right. I also had a milkshake  which the girl at the counter made \\extra thick\\\" so it would survive the 5 minute car ride home (how sweet is that?!). Oh and the fries were awesome! I think that their pricing is pretty good. Maybe the extra toppings are a little pricey  but the quality is there so we didn't mind too much.  My boyfriend said that he heard some talk of an ostrich burger and an antelope burger while he was waiting for the food... Not really sure what is going on with that! Maybe there is a new special in the works.\"\n",
      "So glad my wife found this place.  We travel to philly regularly and this is now easily the best meal I've ever had there.  Far superior to the cheese steaks.  We had the Mac & Cheese  fries  and I had a burger with grilled onions and mushrooms.  May have been the best burger I've ever had in my life. Chipotle mayo was fantastic.  The service is unbelievable.  You order at the counter but they visit your table more then a five star restaurant.\n",
      "Delicious food  comfortable atmosphere very chill spot I loved my Dr. Pepper pork sandwich  sides are extremely good definitely a good spot in Philly on a chill night.\n",

      "Best Korean food I have in U.S. . The BBQ is so so so GREAT! What's more important for me  I won't smell bad after the BBQ because of its good ventilator.\n",
      "I've always wanted Korean BBQ  and this place definitely did not disappoint! The food was so good  and I loved using the grill to cook everything. Also  our waiter Clyde was the man  he made sure we had everything we needed :)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Surprised by the size of the restaurant. It was my first time getting Korean food in Philly so I honestly didn't know what to expect and may be biased with my rating. In one line  \\The food was alright but I've tasted better - their service was mediocre\\\"   There was a kind gentleman who opened the door for us when we arrived at the restaurant. Super kind! Then the hostess greeted us and seated us (a group of 6) in the large dining area. It seemed to be a busy Friday night. We ordered 3 large dishes and they were all delicious with small wish for improvements.   1) Bossam was delicious - thinly sliced and comes with fresh oysters. The radish kimchi was well seasoned and the salted cabbage was really good too! Overall really fresh ingredients. BUT I could smell something really porky- I am fine with it but I know that some sensitive people won't be happy with the smell the dweji   2) kimchi dweji dooroochigi - This was really good too. The pork was well simmered and tender. The tofu in it was delicious too - firm in shape but tender tasting. One thing that would make it better would be if the kimchi had more texture. The kimchi just broke down - not a slight bit of crunch. But it was really well seasoned - loved the coarse cracked peppers.   3) Nakji jeongol - This was my least favorite dish. I think our waiter forgot about us and overcooked it. Nakji (Octopus) is best when it is cooked just the right amount. when overcooked  it becomes tough. And that's what happened to ours - It became tough. The broth was delicious but a little disappointing with the octopus itself.   I really don't know what to expect in Philly for good Korean food so I may be biased in my review. Delicious food regardless but i've had better. It was alright. A-Okay~\"\n",
      "Third time's the charm! Each time I eat here I hone what I like and how much food we should order (very easy to over order with the appetizer accompaniment).  Absolutely love the mandu and kimchee pancake. Got an assortment of meats for the grill: bulgogi  spicy beef and pork.  The wait ~7pm on a Saturday was about 30-45 minutes  but it was well worth the wait. And the palate-cleansing drink (cinnamon based) is quite delightful.  The only cons: green tea served in plastic pitchers pick up the plastic taste.\n",
      "Honestly the best Korean BBQ place in Philly  no other restaurant can compare!! I've tried a lot of restaurants trying to find authentic Korean food and Seorabol is hands down the best. I've been coming here for years ever since! Actually  I'm having dinner with my coworkers and friend Tiffany right now as I write this review haha. Definitely worth trying! Great food and great service!  Not the type to usually write a review so credit goes to Clyde for convincing me to write this review\n",
      "\n",
      "Hands down best breakfast in Philly!  I've only been here for four months  but I have tried nearly every \\Best of\\\" spot in town.  I'm a breakfast fanatic so I get little over critical.  However  this small cafe has managed to create incredible flavor while keeping their dishes fresh and simplistic.  While the actual space is \\\"cozy \\\" this menu could easily keep a place as big as Parc overflowing with patrons.\"\n",
      "The atmosphere was nice and small. Very busy for brunch  expect at least a 30-45 minute wait. I recommend the spinach  caramelized onion and goat cheese omelet  but request a little less goat cheese. (this one was way too much  would have been better with 1 2 the amount).  Oh and the fruit was served perfectly ripe. Cash only.\n",
      "You know when you go to place  have an ok meal and then you forget it exists? That is Ants Pants Cafe: forgetable.   I don't know why I forgot Ants Pants the first time. I think I enjoyed my food and the service was fine. I think it was that Ants Pants was merely unexceptional.   Today  a friend suggested Ants Pants. I thought  \\Oh yeah. That place.\\\" We wandered over from my job and had a very late brunch. I had two eggs and my friend had a salad. Both plates were good  but nothing struck a chord. There should be something you tell your friends with relish or with venom. There should be something that sticks out about a place. The atmosphere at Ants Pants wreaks of BLAH.   I can say that whoever designed Ants Pants is a genius of spatial planning. For a place so small   they smanage to fit 24 seats well enough. But should seating charts spring to mind for where you go for brunch?   No. Very Blah.\"\n",
      "My favorite local go-to place for yummy grub.  Ants Pants has not disappointed me yet! Food is always delicious and price is good. Love  love their shoe string fries! Salads are fresh and sandwiches are fancy. I give it 4 stars because they do not accept credit cards  it is cash only and they do have an ATM machine.\n",
      "The food is quite good (and at a lower price than other  similar popular brunch spots in philly). The stuffed french toast  smoothies  and fries were all delicious. The wait is usually a bit long b c seating is very limited.\n",
      "Went for brunch this past Sunday. The hostess was very nice and efficient  offering us coffee and letting us know how long the wait would be.  Unfortunately  the wait for a table is WAY TOO LONG  and then the wait for service is WORSE.  We got there a little after 10:30 am  and the waitress said the wait would be about a half hour.  So we waited outside.  She was very nice  giving us coffee and refills while we waited.  After about 30 minutes  she asked us to stand inside the restaurant  saying it would speed-up seating. We then waited another 15 minutes.  We finally sat down at a table  and ordered our food.  Our food did not arrive until noon!  I had the bacon stack  which was tasty.  Unfortunately  I need to agree with other reviewers--the food does not justify the wait.\n",
      "Seriously Ants Pants?  It's time to step up your game.  I've loved you for a long time but recently the quality and consistency seems to have slid downhill.  Today's chicken/red pepper/avocado sammy was an embarrassment. Smearing a rotten avocado all over my baguette?  Did you think I wouldn't notice?  Wilted lettuce for the salad?  FOR 9$?    Also when I order a bagel sandwich to-go  if you could do more than throw the thing in a paper bag (wrap it in foil?)  that would be great.    The details count.  Don't make me break up with you for good!\n",
      "Brunch was solid. I got the Stack  friends got French Toast w  Brie cheese. Coffee was good  wait time was minimal and service was great. Highly recommended.\n",
      "We had the Italian sausage sweet potato hash  the beef sweet potato hash and the Brie stuffed French toast. It was amazing and I am now swimming in a glorious food coma. I will come back here over and over again. It's packed and a little loud in here  but I would expect that from an awesome brunch place. Just be prepared to wait 15-20 mins for your table on a Saturday Sunday.\n",
      "had brunch with two friends one weekend day. one of the diners chose ant's pants. i've walked by this establishment on the way to work and didn't realize how cramped and small it is until i came for brunch. even though we arrived at like 9am (or some relatively early time)  the place was packed - both in terms of seated and waiting diners. the layout of the place isn't the best  there's a long  narrow walkway to get to the seating area  in which those waiting for a seat are standing and those trying to pay a bill are waiting near the cashier. it can be hard to maneuver without accidentally bumping into someone.   the food was ok. i got an omelet with veggies and cheese with a side of fruit. it was pretty standard - nothing that blew my mind. the fruit was a little wimpy in terms of size and taste but it got the job done.  price was reasonable - i don't remember being shocked at my portion of the bill.  nota bene: your party won't be seated until everyone arrives. this makes perfect sense because this restaurant is incredibly busy and needs to turn over tables quickly.\n",
      "My partner and I love nom nom! They're inexpensive  quick  and attentive. Soup is consistantly delicious and always hot. The pork belly spicy miso is my favorite. Their decor is also really cool. Just be aware  cash only!\n",
      "Yes!  Finally a ramen-centric place in Philly!  This place is pretty new and seems to have some growing pains  but I see a lot of potential.  They're short on staff  which may result in some overlooked order add-ons or a little bit of a wait  but don't let that distract you from a yummy and cheap bowl of noodles.  While the ramen choices are limited (salt  miso  spicy  and soy sauce)  they do come in small and large sizes.  This is great  since I would never be able to finish a large bowl by myself  so having a cheaper and smaller option is great.  You get one less piece of pork belly  but it costs about $1.5 less.  Both the spicy ramen I ordered and soy sauce that my man ordered were pretty good.  The noodles were cooked well and the pork belly was surprisingly tender for how lean it was (diet pork belly  yes!).  My major criticism (and this is a real issue) is that it was a little too shallow on the broth.  I didn't notice either to be too salty  but I like my food over-seasoned.  I also added an egg to my ramen.  The cooks forgot it initially  but brought it out after we alerted them.  The egg was cooked perfectly (medium-boiled)  but it did cost about $1.5 extra  so I'm not sure if it's worth it (could order the large for the same total price).  We also ordered the pork buns  and they seem to use the same pork as in the ramen.  It's lean for pork belly  but again  cooked nice and tender.  They give you two slabs of it per pork bun  so it literally splits the bun open.  It's a bit messy  but I'm not complaining  the more pork the better.  My only complaint is the addition of cucumber slices to the buns.  Maybe I'm biased toward the cucumber-less ways at other eateries  but I do feel that the cucumber gives an overpowering (and not particularly pleasant) taste and texture to the bun.  It interrupted the enjoyment of the pork and doesn't add any additional crunch - which the lettuce supplies.  I took the cucumber out of my last few bites and enjoyed the meaty sweet pork bun much more.   I think this place definitely deserves a try and it shouldn't be judged by NYC or West Coast standards. At least not in its inaugural season.  It fills a definite void in Philly and for now  it's my ramen lifeline.\n",
      "I USED to adore this location.  I was happy to know they were recently remodeling and excited to head back to see the changes. Once entering the tiny locale I was surprised that they had moved to a table service type of spot.  Which is fine - but my whole meal seemed rushed  the staff stressed  and the ramen bland.  I left there extreme disappointed. I will not be returning.\n",
      "For the price and quality  I would rather make shin ramen at home.  I ordered the karai miso with a soft boiled egg.  The broth was lacking in flavor and depth and the bamboo shoots tasted rotten.  The only part of the ramen I enjoyed was the egg.  Ended up with a stomach ache afterwards.  Definitely not coming back to Nom Nom.\n",
      "Luke warm ramen and could eggs won't come again The service was nice the restaurant was also nice . The food tasted okay but again my eggs where cold and the soup broth diddnt even warm the eggs.\n",
      "Came in for lunch on a Friday and got a table immediately.  Our service was good  especially since we weren't very needy customers.  I ordered the Pork Belly Miso  which was served with a few different types of veggies  lots of noodles and soup  and 2 large pieces of pork belly.  Overall  the flavor was decent  but all I kept thinking was pho is so much better.  My co-worker had the Spicy Miso  which I did not try.  She enjoyed it  but could only finish half of the broth because it was too spicy for her  so buyer beware!    I would probably go back because I love soup  but the prices were kind of high for soup  especially when you're looking at $10-$14  and pho costs $6-8 for much larger portions (btw  not complaining about the portion size at all  it's just that my favorite pho places usually give enough for two meals).\n",
      "Cash Only No table service.  Walk right up to the blackboard by the counter to read the menu and proceed to order at the counter.  Find your own table (which could be a bit hard during lunch time) Boiled egg not included in Ramen. It's an add on. Good location if you are in downtown/rittenhouse square area.  So the day before I went to Terakawa and was still impressed. Still in the mood for more yummy ramen but I didn't want to make my way out to Chinatown on a rainy day. We stayed at the hotel in Rittenhouse square area and this Nom Nom Ramen is super close and walkable even in the rain so we gave it a try.  We went around 1.30 pm and the restaurant still has some of the lunch crowds but we were able to grab small table for two right after ordering.  I was a bit awkward at the order counter since I did not read the board thoroughly and felt a bit rush by the lady who took our order. When I asked some questions it wasn't a very pleasant conversation as if i'm bothersome. So service is definitely NOT a 4 stars here. But I'm here for food and willing to set that issue aside.  The sad part of feeling rush was that I forgot to add on their \\supposed to be\\\" awesome egg :( Well  I wouldn't know if it's awesome or not.   We had Miso and Spicy Ramen.  I think all broth are Tonkotsu base  the broth are really good in my opinion. Right amount of thickness  great flavor.  Both the miso and the spicy turned out pretty well.  The ramen noodle is well cooked with good texture.  The spicy is pretty well spiced for my taste. Maybe a bit much for some  the man sat next to our table had to stop to wipe his sweat quite a few times before continuing on his spicy journey. I think I even heard him whisper to himself  \\\"Ooh Spicaay!\\\" :D  We also ordered pork bun. It's just ok. The one I tried at Terakawa the day before was much much better. This one  the meat was a bit on the dry side.   All in all  avoid lunch hours if you could. Don't bother about the service (maybe they are nicer when not busy hours) focus on the ramen and the broth and you will be fine. Food is good here.  And... Try the egg for me  will you?\"\n",
      "I don't know why this place has such lousy reviews. I consider myself a ramen fiend and I've sampled ramen from Washington  D.C. to San Francisco  and I always love coming back to Nom Nom. This place was one of the first places I ever tried ramen and it will always be near and dear to my heart. They recently converted from ordering at the counter to table service  which I think is a pleasant change. Their pork buns are on point and more than once they've brought me an extra (free) portion because of how voraciously we devoured them. I generally order their pork ramen  but I've also had the miso and I think both are great options. The seasoned eggs that they prepare are so so good!! I also love their pork belly and often order extra. You can order a large portion for a few dollars extra- do it. It's great to bring some home for leftovers. I love how springy their noodles are and their bamboo doesn't taste canned like many ramen joints. Their prices are a little too high considering the ambiance is pretty low-key  but I will always come back here when I'm in the city.\n",
      "The pork belly buns are so tender and moist! And the service is great! Loved it all and will be frequenting it there a lot in the future! Also  not too crowded for lunch\n",
      "I can't get enough of the pork buns  so tasty and I feel like I could eat 6 of them but that wouldn't leave me any room for the yummy Shio Tonlotsu. I will return to have more buns and different ramen during my next trip to Philly.\n",
      "All of hype about Federal Donuts made me a little worried it wouldn't live up to it's reputation. But  it absolutely did. I'm a vegetarian so I can only personally comment on the donuts and coffee  however  my husband is obsessed with the chicken. His favorite is the buttermilk ranch.  The donuts are pretty amazing. Paired with an iced coffee and it doesn't get any better. The staff couldn't be nicer- even when they're busy.\n",
      "This downtown Philly donut joint was decent -- but far from spectacular.  Tried a few different donuts and they were merely cake donuts with different toppings.  Too much of a cake donut taste (which I don't particularly care for).  I can't possibly rate this spot any higher than 3 stars when the greatest donuts on the planet  (Beiler's Donuts) are merely a few blocks away in the Reading Terminal Market.\n",
      "I'd heard the hype. Seen the NY Times article. Nevertheless I was skeptical. Mainly because most people have at best  two reference points for donuts  Dunkin Donuts or Krispy Kreme. Neither of which really makes truly great donuts.  So after waiting for the crowds to die down a little  I traveled over to see for myself last Saturday.  It's a small shop that blends into the surrounding neighborhood. Inside there are a couple of seats at the counter and a wide window well that two people could sit in. I ordered my donuts. I went with the Indian Cinnamon  the caramel banana  the pina colada  and the halva pistachio. The ladies behind the counter worked as fast as they could given the decent sized collection of people waiting for orders and bopping in. My order was processed quickly  and I got my coffee right after I ordered it. The coffee was one of the only things that was a disappointment besides the lack of seating.   Since there was no room to sit  much less stand I took my donuts and coffee out to a park just off of Federal between 3rd and 4th St. The donuts were truly transcendant.  Each donut was a symphony of flavors on my tongue.  The Indian Cinnamon-Very light on the cinnamon  coated with sugar. Hot  fresh  and so moist that it pinched in half when I started to eat it.  The caramel banana-A delicious meld of flavors with something added to the banana chips that made them more tasty than I\\d imagined.  The pina colada-The donut I though I'd enjoy the least. However it tasted like the Rach 3 and Beethoven's 9th all rolled up. A complex mix of flavors that together was truly amazing. And unlike the current generations  I don't use that term lightly.  The halva and pistachio-the final movement. More subtle flavors that nevertheless worked well. I'd never had halva before  but I liked it.  Believe the hype. Believe the NY Times article. Federal Donuts makes some of the best donuts I've had.\"\n",
      "I have to say that I was really impressed with this place. I had heard about it here on Yelp and decided I should try it. I ordered the ranch fried chicken and the indian cinnamon donut and both were very good. I also had what I would call their plain donut and it was delicious. The donuts were moist and warm and extremely tasty and were probably the best I have ever had. The chicken was tender and moist and also delicious. The only downside to this place is the size. The restaurant is very small and there is very little seating. The seating is diner style  stools at a counter. This would be a great place for takeout  which they do.  Overall I would definitely recommend going here. I would also recommend going early as they tend to sell out fairly quickly in the mornings.\n",
      "The Indian cinnamon donuts are delicious!  The rest are just OK  the fancy donuts were nothing to rave about and I had such high expectations for the fried chicken  but it was also pretty standard stuff.  But definitely grab a dozen Indian cinnamons.\n",
      "Ok sometimes the hype  doesnt meet what is delivered  but I think Fed Donuts needs more hype.  Finally had  the chicken after several of their amazing donuts and all I can is wow. I had the buttermilk ranch it was amazing. Unlike any fried chicken that I have prior. I will make it a weekly spot from now on.   Get there early things tend to sell out before 2pm.\n",
      "I stopped using Yelp because I became lazy and didn't feel like spending 10-15 after eating to write about a restaurant  but this place changed my way of thinking!  Federal Donuts opened up in my neighborhood 5-6 years ago and I never stopped in to try it out. After hear one raving review after another  I said enough is enough and took a walk over...and I was not disappointed (except for one minor factor).  Upon walking in the women behind the counter were so sweet and patient. I told them it was my first time and they were more than happy to work with me while I surveyed the entire menu. Eventually I ended up ordering for my dad and I two chicken sandwiches and two cinnamon sugar \\fresh and hot\\\" donuts  and a cold brew coffee for myself. This is where the one bad part of my experience comes in: the price. These five items came to $21.60  which I believe is quite expensive.  The cold brew coffee is soooo good. I feel like most places try to nail it down and can never get it right  but Federal Donuts sure did! It had a very robust coffee flavor.  The chicken sandwich was absolutely delicious  the chicken was juicy with a crispy battered outside  the seasoning was nice and balanced  the touch of sauce was just right  and the potato bun was very fresh.  The cinnamon sugar donut...just  wow. These people don't lie when they say it's \\\"hot and fresh.\\\" It was warm  soft  moist  and loaded with cinnamon sugar. I could easily eat 3-4 of those things in one sitting. At $1.50 a piece you are paying a premium for quality.   Despite the price being a little high  I will definitely be back to try their other varieties of donuts and chicken. 10/10 (or 5/5  according to Yelp).\"\n",
      "The chicken is over rated. It's better from Acme. The donuts  even the fancy one's seem plain.\n",
      "I like donuts. Hot fresh now at Krispy Kreme used to be my Mecca of donuts. Now that I have tried Federal's donuts  I have vowed that no other donut is worthy of the calories.  A plus is that the folks are nice and the location makes it feel \\real.\\\"\"\n",

      "I came to South Philadelphia Tap Room before a Phillies game and left full and satisfied. I had the Bacon and Jalepeño Omelette  served alongside home fries and wheat toast. For just $13  I thought that the portion size was more than generous  everything on the plate was flavorful  and before you know it  my plate was licked clean!  One item that I was not a big fan of  however  were the Mexican Chocolate Doughnuts. I found them rather dry and not worth the $6 price tag.     The service was somewhat attentive  but I would have liked to have been checked up on at some point during our meal.   All in all  this is a great brunch spot in south Philadelphia. Great food  great prices  and the perfect spot to eat before a sporting event down at the AT&T complex.\n",
      "The service here was very good.   Waitstaff was attentive and willing to let me get a taste of some of the variety of craft beers.   The atmosphere is casual and relaxed  but the food is the sad part of this restaurant.   My wife and I like organic  grass-fed beef.  SPTR menu had advertised that they had hamburgers with organic beef. Unfortunately  the chef knows only one spice...SALT.   If you like salty food  you'll LOVE this place.   The clams in broth were salty  my wife's pork sandwich was salty and my $11 Organic Grass-Fed burger was so salty  I could barely eat it.    I would go here again  only if I were in the neighborhood  but only for beer.\n",
      "I went to meet some friends on a Friday night. It was surprisingly empty (might just have been an off time)  Decor is five stars  bottle list is 4 stars (although  they were out of the saison du pont. bummer)  but for a place called \\tap room\\\" I felt their draft list was lacking terribly. Very typical beers (alot of Bells?) and no real rarities.  All in all I got a nice vibe in there  but I don't think I would go out of my way to go back\"\n",
      "Just went here for the first time and it was spectacular  can't believe I am just now finding out about it.  First off  the bar has a great ambiance  very clean  great lighting  not too loud but still lively to just the right degree.  The bartenders were attentive and the service was solid.  More importantly  the beer selection was very good with a wide array of draft beers and an even bigger bottle selection (my favorite was the Stone Russian stout).  Foodwise  also awesome.  We had the grassfed burger with what seemed like homemade ketchup (it was awesome whatever it was) and this awesome mustard.  We also had the mac 'n cheese which was just amazing  it looked like something you would get for $30 at an expensive restaurant  it had this sweet mushrooms on top that really complimented the cheese very well.  I'm excited to go back and try their grilled cheese (supposed to be the best in the city) along with their wild boar tacos.  Additionally  the prices can't be beat for what you get.  Overall  great spot to go for dinner  beers  happy hour  lunch  brunch  etc...  I doubt this place can do a bad meal.\n",
      "The only reason I gave it three stars is because of the beer selection. I ordered the headcheese taco as a starter  which if I had know was \\deconstructed\\\"  I would of skipped. Also save your money on the burger and go to the POPE instead. Very limited menu  but attentive service.\"\n",
      "Been here couple times with friends. Always have a good time with good foods and beverages. But last night  i went there with my girlfriend who come visited me from out of country. We've planned to spent another good time in this place when the new waitress ( i've never seen her before) asked my girlfriend to show her id. As a tourist she didn't have any State ID on her so she gave her a copy of her passport ( she never bring a real one for safety purpose ) with clear picture  full name and Date of birth. But the waitress refused to even take a look at that. She just said that she has to be older than 21 to walked into the place. Well  my girlfriend is 26 and it clearly print on a passport's copy. We've tried to reasoned with her but she keep refused to hear us. We're so upset and decided to just leave. To make matter worse  me and my girlfriend been there for at least two times before. The other waitresses seems to recognized us but they're just keep quiet. It's a shame since we really love this place. But after this incident we will never step our foot on this place again. My girlfriend felt humilliated and embarrased. Thank you for the \\great\\\" service!\"\n",
      "Stumbled upon this place when a friend moved into neighborhood  we were going to eat as well so I looked up the menu... poblano mole wings! Got to try them! Being a wing connoisseur I was excited about this. They were very god and lived up to expectation! Now I say \\were\\\" because they removed them from the menu. I went there specifically for the wings! Not a beer drinker and not \\\"hip\\\" on vegetarian food not much else grabbed me  but the poblano mole wings were great! Last night went there with a large group (me just for the wings and wine of course) and they were gone. Replaced by a dry naked fried wing served sparingly with some fried jalapeno and onions. No flavor  no taste and very dry! I told the waitress if I didn't like them I wasn't coming back and that may be true because they were terrible! I gave a few a try with no sauce then needed some hot sauce or something... they gave me their homemade hot sauce which wasn't bad (kind of salsa verde not really hot sauce) but was a saver to the dry crippled wings (they NEED a sauce). Wish they would bring back the mole wings  just saying! Until then probably won't suggest SPTR again! Otherwise atmosphere is good... but why change a good thing!\"\n",
      "there is something comforting about simplicity.  one of the most warming sensations is sitting down at moms kitchen table and having her whip me up a grilled cheese with tomato soup.   now that i am grownup (whatever that means)   sitting down to grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup means going to the sptr. it is so simple. 3 cheeses. texas-thick bread. tomato lager soup. fabulous! and...i can drink a beer with it! my favorite match is hitachino white ale.  sptr is a great place if you are into beer. and  if you aren't  be curious. try something you have never had before. their selection is great and they always have a list of specials. you can always try something before you buy.  service has always been great in my experiences. the servers know their shit.  issues? 1. you can run into trouble finding a seat. they don't have any \\method\\\" of seating.  it can be uncomfortable standing around  waiting for a table to open. i feel like i am stalking the other diners. also  i have been \\\"out seated\\\" by some hipsters before so  if it is busy  be aggressive or you will never get a table.  hipsters are sneaky... 2. i am veg and their are only 2 options on the menu. they are really good options but  i would love it if they had a veg special every now and again.\"\n",
      "My favorite bar in South Philly.  Their mac & cheese and mole wings are amazing! Also  they always have a fantastic selection of beers on tap. My boyfriend is in love with the meatloaf as well. Can't say enough about this place.  Edited down to reflect the menu changes--no spicy vegan hoagie  no mole wings  no more meat loaf. Still the best beers on draft  however.\n",
      "After hearing about this place for over a year  finally found an excuse to go: Founders Friday. There's nothing like drinking usually expensive Founders beers for almost 1/2 price.  Walked in at 4:30 and the place was already full. Was imressed by the draft beer selection AND the bottle list. Server was attentive throughout the evening. As the evening sped along  the place got busier and busier.   Ordered the southern fried chicken wings and an order of mac and cheese. The wings were seriously great. They were crunchy and had enough of a hint of salt to make the flavor pop. The side order of collard greens were spicy and cooked quite well. The mac and cheese was delicious.   Definitely going back again. I shall never have to find an excuse to have to go  I will just get off my lazy ass and go.\n",
      "Had heard tons of excellent reviews about this place and was excited to go here. Ended up going for the Sunday tasting menu. I guess like anything that's been hyped up too much  we left disappointed and hungry. Sorry guys  will not be coming back. It's already incredibly difficult to find a table in this place because it is so small  which of course also adds to the hype.  Perhaps a weekday experience where you can order is more satisfying? Sadly  I won't be risking an overpriced  overhyped experience.\n",
      "I am not one to write a review about a dining experience because I am in the restaurant business myself and I feel that people do not give the right perspective of the restaurant just because of something they didn't like personally. That being said I MUST write a review praising Little Fish and their employees last night. My girlfriend and I are both in the business and understand the last minute right before closing two top can be a pain. But we heard great things and it was the only time we could make it. We were the last table in the restaurant and the kitchen staff and our waitress didn't make us feel rushed at all. I have to give a million thanks to the kitchen staff because the food and plating was incredible  just because we were the last table they did not take any less pride in their dishes than they were at the beginning of dinner service. My girlfriend and I have ate all over Philadelphia and hands down I can clearly say that Little Fish has been the best meal I have had in Philadelphia! I mean I never write reviews and I'm here the morning after praising. Keep up the great work over there from one professional to another. I will be back without a doubt to continue to see what new plates you have.\n",
      "This intimate BYOB rocked the dishes they put out. All were simple  beautifully presented  and flavorsome. The downside is that space is quite small so it can get loud as the evening goes on and at times the service felt rushed.\n",
      "Apr 27  2012   Went to diner last night with 3 other people. Portions very small  with a limited  & pricy menu.  All entrees were warm  not hot when we were served.    We are frequent restaurant goers in the City.   Service was fine.  The restaurant was cold  we asked several times can the heat be turned up.   When it came time to pay the check we gave the waiter our  $ 100 Little Fish gift card which was rejected.   The waitier & the owner refused the card saying this is a new owner &   they cannot honor the gift card. The owner said he did not get the money when the card was purchased  therefore the card could not be used by us. .   We talked & argued with the owner but to no avail.    We were disappointed  in the entire evening  & will not return to the restaurant.\n",
      "Great little byob. It's a upscale kind of place  and they charge the price for it  but it's worth it! I had a very tasty amberjack in a miso reduction with a side of veggies I can't really recall. All of it very flavorful and well executed.   Will return\n",
      "We dined here for a friend's birthday who had been there before and said  \\It was one of the best meals I've ever had.\\\" Based on that  my expectations were high.  Menu is on a chalkboard and hand written on a tiny piece of paper. I like that they offered some unheard of fish  such as Cobia--a whitefish from Florida. My husband ordered that  prepared jerk style with coconut rice. It was good. Not great though. Definitely not $30 great  but I'm willing to pay a premium on fish sustainably caught. Maybe I'm not used to jerk seasoning but I found it too salty. I ordered the ceviche  with lobster  fluke  and bass I think? And hearts of palm and citrus. For $13 it was a pretty generous portion but it couldve used more kick as I am accustomed to in a ceviche. I also ordered mixed greens (I think it was just bibb lettuce though) in a blood orange vinaigarette. There were blood oranges mixed in  which I love  but the dressing didn't taste citrusy at all. Plus there was absolutely nothing else in the salad  which I found boring and and somewhat lazy. Having to slice my lettuce was also a new experience which was distracting while dining. But at least it was all fresh. We had a small child with us whom they accommodated by halving the halibut meal. My friend had the halibut which looked good  but she didn't comment on. Then the dessert offerings were recited...one chocolate mousse-type selection  and a fruit tart  i believe? My friend opted for the chocolate for us all to split. I will say  it came in a cup that could fit in the palm of your hand  and had some nuts sprinkled on top  but it was more pudding than mousse. She took one bite and I ate the rest. It tasted just fine  but I was surprised that they didn't have something a little more impressive. It was just as good as the chocolate pudding at the Whole Foods salad bar. All in all  it was a decent  allbeit  very expensive meal. I'm glad I tried it out  but they didn't hook me enough to justify a return visit.\"\n",
      "This south philly joint is a huge favorite of philly yelp.  Had to give it a try.  Food was of good quality and made in interesting preparations.  I like the small menu  small sized dinning area  and  of course  the BYOB factor.  The one knock I have is the expensive pricing.  Entrees range from 23 - 28ish  but the food is more on the 17 - 22 level.  Nothing to take away  its still a great dinner.  Pricing could be a bit more appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not sure if it's possible to have a bad meal here. The seafood is always fresh and cooked to perfection.  The service is always spot-on. Definitely a nice place for a date.  Do not skip out on dessert. You would think the chefs are also pastry/dessert chefs with how delectable and delicate the desserts are. I even ordered the same dessert twice because it was just that good. So save some room! I didn't  but it was so worth ordering it twice.\n",
      "I too am confused with the rave reviews of this place and expected to be wowed... I was not. In terms of seafood  I've definitely had better and fresher... it's possible their seafood is fresh  but the execution of it left more to be desired. Most of my dishes were overcooked and dry.   I also found it very annoying that all my plates including the  bread plate  was chipped. I am surprised that none of the good reviews mentioned this especially since they paid a decent amount for their dish. I really hope that since I last went there (3 weeks ago) everything has been replaced...   The waiter too was a little upsetting... he made it seem as though we were going to give him a hard time  before we even got seated and we had to wait longer than we should to be able to order  since the table next to us got there after us and was able to get their order in before we did.\n",
      "Probably the best pho in Philly....  Actually some of the best Pho I've ever had.  couple of downsides... #1) pho is the only thing they serve  you can't even get a spring roll here...  #2) service is total crap...  #3) they only take cash...  But really  if we're talking the best pho in the city do you really care about these 3 minor issues?  I know I sure don't.\n",
      "This is my favorite pho spot in Philly!   This place is simple  quick and delicious. I usually get a bowl of pho and an iced coffee with condensed milk.   The pho comes out SO fast. I'm talking about 5 minutes after you order. Amazing.  The pho broth is very flavorful yet not overly salty  the veggies are fresh  they give a lot of basil for you to add  and they load up your bowl of pho with a lot of meat.   When you're done  you can just go up front to pay. Cash only.\n",
      "This is by far my favorite spot for Phò!!! It is perfect every time! It's the kind of soup that heals the soul. I always enjoy the eye round  well done brisket and skirt steak Phò. This restaurant is strictly for Phò only!!  Cash only!\n",
      "\n",
      "The broth was what carried the whole place. The soup was the perfect thing on a cold  rainy day. Highly recommended! The beef soup is where I went and where I go. It's so simple  but the broth is just hard to make at home. I'll be back.\n",
      "Clean  clean  clean! Pho is very good  iced coffee dreamy. Unlike other pho joints everything is clean  no greasy tea pots or grimy condiment containers. And they are very glad to see you!\n",
      "Great Pho!  Great value! Awesome broth!  Quick service!  Only downside is that it is cash only so bring cash! Oh and NO PARKING!  But service it's GREAT and very very QUICK so if you are in a rush and don't have much time this is a great place to stop by for a quick munch!\n",
      "The staff knew my father in Vietnam and saw me in diapers and before I can even talk  so to come into Pho 75 and be patted on the head and given candy makes me hope that this small yet incredible restaurant will be around for when I have children of my own.  I refuse to go anywhere else to eat ph  it's not the same. It's like cheating on a partner  really. The broth is heavily and comes quickly  never making you wait for more than twenty minutes. I remember this restaurant being crazy  having a long wait and now  it's a hit or miss which is fine by me  I'd happily wait for hours if it means only eating there.  I always get the special or the vegetarian bowl which is massive and hearty  nothing beats inhaling a bowl on a cold day!  It's been in the neighborhood since 1990 and hopefully will be there to stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "From reading up  I know pho is supposed to contain hints of many spices.  Pho 75's broth was the first in which I could actually detect many of them.  It was a pleasant surprise to taste that complexity rather than salt  beef  and salt!    The meat is fresh and both meat and noodles are plentiful.  The small bowl here is the closest I've ever come to finishing an entire order of pho  so it's probably the most realistic size for those wishing to avoid food babyism.    The parking lot is atrocious (narrow and full of craters) and the ambience of the restaurant leaves a lot to be desired.  I don't know what new age synthesizer music from 1986 they were playing  but I don't want to hear it ever again.  Fortunately for Pho 75  the pho is worth it.\n",
      "Had a reservation tonight for a party of 18  however upon arrival we were told that our reservation was canceled due to a private party. We were never notified of the cancellation nor were we accommodated for our party. Very disappointed in how this situation was handled by the management tonight and will never recommend this bar restaurant to our colleagues.\n",

      "Ended up here on Sunday evening  and again a little later on Sunday night this past weekend (plans changed and it turned out being alright).  My boo and I stopped in for an early evening drink around 6ish and there were a decent amount of seats at the bar. I had the Clown Shoes Clementine Ale which I really liked a lot  and we had one of the pretzels to share. The cheese fondue sauce that comes with the pretzel is so good.. I could probably drink it. The pretzel was pretty good too  although overall I think I prefer Brauhaus' pretzel over Bru's.  Fast forward about 3 hours  to meeting up with friends back at Bru  and the place is packed. I get what others are saying in reviews about this place being a bro bar  because it totally is. I remained faithful to the Clown Shoes Clementine throughout the night and wasn't disappointed. I don't think that the prices for the beer are too expensive at all  and there's also a decent selection for those who are adventurous and like to try a bunch of new things.  We didn't try the tap your own beer wall  although I'd be interested to see what it's all about next time we stop in.  Overall  this is a pretty cool place with a decent atmosphere  and I'd definitely go back to Bru to try some of their food options and try some other beers.\n",
      "Philly Beer week 2017.  Always an excellent selection of beer.  A pretzel and mustard l  and food selection that makes it an authentic German restaurant.  Ironically I drop in here on my way to Germany - bc it's just as good and my English is better than my German.  Great wait staff and good crowd of people.  Come early for the best service especially on weekends.  Go across the street for some live music after a few pints and some food.\n",

      "BRÜ-more like BOOO. I had high expectation for this place  just fell short. Very dark  very crowded  tight space & even tighter seating. I am a fan of sour beers  many to choose from and our waitress had sick knowledge of all the beers  well that's the positive. Food was average to Blahhhh. Started with the BRÜfries  looked like a cat threw up on them  but very good..Girlfriend started with the apple and potato pancakes  ahhh it was OK. Time for another beer to take my mind of the disappointment if the apps. Dinner  I had the Doner Kabob- (lamb shoulder  pickles  iceburg  yogurt sauce  flatbread) it was OK  and a side of  Spätzel- fried  no taste  needed salt or even a gravy. Time for another beer to add some flavor to this food. Girlfriend got typical Wurst sammy  she said it was good  she didn't finish it....I guess we'll have more more beer before we roll out since the beers were on point.\n",
      "A nice vibe inside. The food was decent  but the beer was expensive. $8 for a dunkel is a bit much. I do wonder if the male staff has to wear shorts with their butt cheeks hanging out and sexy tights. The uniform for the female servers isn't much different than a place like Hooters.\n",
      "This place is excellent! I went in for a nice relaxing drink after a hard day's work and was immediately greeted by the friendly staff. I got a nice  quiet section all to myself and my server  Tiffany  was nothing but pleasant. I got two beers that were both delicious and neither I've seen at other bars in Philadelphia. Mind you  I've lived in Philadelphia for awhile. Tiffany seemed to really know what she was talking about while making suggestions to me about what to drink. The beer wall was nothing short of amazing! I've seen such a cool feature in a bar before! Needless to say  I'll be making multiple trips here and bringing friends! Thanks Brü!\n",
      "Chill place. First came here with a gf and my cousin during HH-time on a weekday. Felt the other patrons were watching and completely judging us Asians pouring our beers trying to get minimal foam.....alright can't we all learn things for the first time without being stared out!? Let us beeee.  Second time  I came with a few girlfriends on a Friday night after ice skating at Dilworth. It was chill to just have some beers and hang out. We got to chitchat and also play some checkers. Their pretzel appetizer is good too!  Overall I like this place a lot! :)\n",
      "Being definitively older than the pub crawlers that were in the front of the house  I only stayed long enough to eat a wurst and get onto the next part of my night. Interesting if you want to people watch  but you'll have to contend with the crowds and layers of noise.\n",
      "It's a love hate relationship  The food is hit and miss on any given day  Service is rude on any given day  only the staff not pushing a cart are kind of friendly. I guess that's apart of the dim sum culture   Sit  eat(if you're Lucky to get carts to you)  and leave. I won't be back until  absolutely forced\n",
      "Hands down the worst dim sum I've ever tried. Everything was either cold or overcooked and mushy. Nothing stands out  and I'm not really sure why the wait was so long. The noodles are cold/gluey  the dumpling skins are mushy and the siu mai is just overcooked. Hubby and I tried a number of dishes and were pretty unhappy with everything. To top it off  it was $40 - how/why/wth?!?  No thanks. No matter how much I crave dim sum  I won't be back.\n",
      "Long wait but went with some Chinese friends for some delicious dim sum. Was there with like 15 people so pretty much pointed to everything on the carts as they came by. Prices seemed reasonable as it only came to $12 per person for lunch (despite our ridiculous over-ordering).  Service isn't great  but it helps if you're with friends who speak the language :)\n",
      "Visiting Philly and had to get us some dim some! As we waited for a table holding onto the #9 slip of paper which we got from the guy with the purple shirt  we noticed the amazing dim sum carts. Sure there were the usual shrimp dumplings and chicken feet   but there were so many different types of dim sum I've never seen in Chicago or San Fran or New York.   We finally got seated at a big round table and shared the table with another couple. Chicken feet were the best I've ever had and the shrimp dumplings were good but nothing to call mom over.  They had this strange fried fish thing. My friend says the direct translation is white rice fish but it was so good. I love anchovies and just fish in general so this ban yu or something  like that was really a treat. Escargot  fried turnip cakes  and 3 cups of tea later  we were pretty stuffed. The bill only came up to about 25 bucks and the two of us feasted.   The service.. Not so great but really at a dim sum place  it's the usual. If you don't have someone that is an adult(40+)who can speak Cantonese  then it's better not to expect great service. That's my take. Btw  when I turn 40+ the adult age I type in will be (50+) so please do not take offense. I just feel forever a kid.\n",
      "Good decent Dim Sum in Chinatown. and you can get all your usual favorites: shumai  shrimp dumplings  steamed pork buns  chicken feat  yummy lotus chicken sticky rice  shrimp beef crepes rolls  etc.  All this was yummy. They of course have the special loud ladies rolling around the yummy carts with dim sum.  You can expect the usual loudness and rudeness that is customary in any busy asian dim sum restaurant.  part of the fun! who doesn't want to scream until you can get their attention?  The food was decent but I still have yet to try the other dim sum around the neighborhood.  This place came highly recommended and I was not disappointed.\n",
      "Always a fun spot for Sunday dim sum.  There's lots of variety  some standard and some exotic.   Enjoy the standard dumplings and pork buns  but be adventurous with the seafood - squid  clams  shrimp.  Well worth it.  Get there by 11:30 AM or you'll be waiting a while  and don't be afraid to offer to share a table - you'll be seated much faster.\n",
      "My friends and I went to the diner in the afternoon (about 1:30pm) and the waitress hushed us to be quick  since they are having lunch at 2:00pm. The service was not too nice  and the food is only considered decent comparing to the dim sums I've had in Chicago and New york.\n",
      "This is the real deal dim sum. Our group got there early Saturday so there was no wait. The carts were full of tasty items that we could not refuse - sticky rice  bean curd  shrimp dumplings etc etc. The sesame balls were the icing on the cake. 5 of us ate like there was no tomorrow and the bill was less than $15 per. It was just about 2 hours from the time we left the house in Suburbia to the time we returned. Obviously  authentic dim sum in Chinatown is not meant for long leisurely meals. High quality food  efficiently served - that's what this place offers.\n",
      "This is just your typical Chinese restaurant with dim sum daily  but everything was only alright. Growing up  dim sum once a week was always a family tradition so my critique might be harsh. We ordered chicken feet  shrimp rice roll  shu mai  and har kow. The shrimp rice roll comes with 3 rolls  but only 2 of them had shrimp in it and one was just plain. Shu mai tasted like the frozen store bought ones that you can get from the Asian supermarket  and the chicken feet was ok. The best dish we got was probably the har kow as the skin was light and the shrimp tasted pretty good. I don't think I'd come back again as there are many other options in Chinatown that also serve dim sum.\n",
      "Ok  I understand this might be the best tasting DIM SUM place in the Philly area but seriously  the service here is HORRIBLE. The manager always seems like to be having a bad day  at least every time when we are here I don't ever recall seeing him smile once! Anyway  that's not really the point.  The point is they have bad service. We came here to try the food but often find it impossible since the cart never came around to us. I swear  the ladies that are pushing the cart seems like they have a system going on where they only serve the food to people they like (Cantonese people)  Overall  we find ourselves leaving this place hunger most of the time since we got tired of waiting for the food to come around. At time  waitress there even yelled at us for no apparent reason! We stop making this place as our regularly Sunday DIM SUM place.  Unless they find u likable  I strongly encourage to try other place  but if you really want good food and tolerance the horrible service  then knock yourself out!!!\n",
      "Came here yesterday at around 4PM for a very late lunch...or should I say linner? Due to the strange timing  my boyfriend and I were the only people in the restaurant. Slightly awkward because I felt as though all of the staff could hear our conversation. Service was good  but keep in mind that this establishment is CASH ONLY (and checks-- luckily  I had my checkbook on me). In this day in age  I find it extremely inconvenient and inconsiderate when businesses do not accept credit card.  Food wise  everything was quite yummy  but nothing mind blowing. We ordered the Grigliata Di Calamari as an appetizer. I usually love my calamari fried  but this was pretty good for grilled calamari. The calamari tasted fresh and was not overcooked  so it was very soft and easy to chew. The seasoning was just right  and we asked for a side of marinara sauce  which was really delicious with the calamari as well.   I had the Ravioli Alla Viola (lobster ravioli) for my main dish and enjoyed it. The pink cognac sauce (which is really orange) was delicious and sat well with my tastebuds. The ravioli was also perfectly cooked-- very soft and easy to consume. My boyfriend had the Pollo Gamberi Alla Marsala  which according to him  was very tasteful. This was a healthier dish  as it came with white chicken breast  mushrooms  and tomatoes. The only food item that I was disappointed by was the bread. It was over-baked and very hard. Just having had my wisdom teeth taken out not long ago  I was sadly unable to consume the bread.   This is overall a decent Italian restaurant with solid food. It is fairly priced among other Italian restaurants in Philly  so that is a plus. It is also BYOB-- another major plus. I went to the Ovest location across the street a few months back with a big party and remembered liking that experience better. Decor here seems a little outdated and could use some work to improve the ambiance. Would come back next time for the food  with bottle in hand :)\n",
      "The food here is wonderful. The restaurant itself is very small. If you are planning to have a conversation over dinner  this is not your place. It can get very loud in there and the tabels are very close together. The food is great though - so it's worth the experience.\n",
      "La Viola is an awesome place  but I think you need to know what you're expecting if you come in on a Friday or Saturday night- it's crowded  loud  and most people are really getting after it. The food is good  especially for the price  and the wait staff is generally nice and on top of it  but this is definitely not a date spot  and if you bring a big group  plan on shouting across the table.   One piece of advice: if the line is too long  go across to La Viola Ovest- same kitchen  same menu  but it's quieter and less busy.\n",
      "I had dinner there last night and all I can say is WOW. I had their pasta special for the night  which consisted of homemade linguini with sausage  shrimp  raddichio  and tomatoes - all in an exceptionally delicious sauce. Everything there is top-notch and the service is great - looking forward to going back and hoping they'll still offer the special!\n",
      "LOVE THIS PLACE!  I lived in Italy for a little bit and it feels pretty close to that mentality: Small plates  not too expensive  intimate environment  and friendly waiters. I was here on a Friday night and noticed the owners close attention to both restaurants. The food always tastes fresh  they never rush you- if anything  they urge you to take your time and enjoy your evening. It's a unique little place and will keep coming back for years to come!\n",
      "\n",
      "Wonderful!  They seriously have their shit together [in both locations].  Personally I prefer the East restaurant  but either way it is certainly my favorite Italian BYOB in Philly.  It's really affordable  they have great specials  and it's just so cute!  I've dined in the East restaurant a few times with one other guest (it's too crammed for larger parties) and I've also been to the West restaurant for a couple birthday dinners and that's been great too.  The servers are warm  responsive  and extremely nice people.  They make me feel like I'm part of their family.  I rarely ever eat Italian food  but La Viola definitely gets it.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite spots in the city.  I've probably dined here about 15 times now  and only once did I think my food was anything less than delicious (and it wasn't bad that one time  just not as delicious as it usually is).  The room is a bit small and can sometimes get kind of loud  but the food is consistently well prepared and the price is incredibly reasonable (especially with BYOB factored in).\n",
      "Really good food and great service. It's a nice restaurant with classy but cosy atmosphere. I wouldn't recommend it for a date because it's kinda crowded and not necessarily super intimate  but it's great for dinners with larger parties. Definitely recommend the ravioli and the vitello. Better to make a reservation  be careful because they also have another location with the same name across the street so make sure to know which one you're going to :)\n",
      "Great food and amazing service. We went for restaurant week and the menu looked like their menu. Impressive from the start. We had arugula and goat cheese salad  antipasto  mushroom trio  pasta and veal sausage  veal medallion  cheese cake  canoli cake.....they don't rush you and work together as a team that creates an environment that is warm and inviting. The food was so good that we called the reservationist while eating dinner to book another reservation before the restaurant week ends. We will be back restaurant week or not.\n",
      "As a late night spot to grab some eats  this place is pretty darn good. It's an above average chinatown restaurant to begin with  so it stands up pretty well compared to other late night options.  I usually get a salty fish and chicken fried rice with some mapo tofu and salt and pepper pork.  Of course  anything that comes in a clay pot (or hot pot) is pretty mouth watering also.   I've never been there during normal hours and I'm usually pretty tipsy (or tired) when I get there so I guess there's a chance it's not as good as I think... but I doubt it.\n",
      "Go somewhere else if you want real fresh authentic Chinese. Went here late night for the first time in years when there were no options. I usually prefer Jade Harbor or Thai Lake for legit Cantonese food in Chinatown. This place seems to cater towards Non-Asians and also attracts undesirables late night. If you order something authentic like Crab Meat Fish Maw Soup or Seafood Pan Fried Noodles  it has no taste and seems like it is flash frozen and microwaved. They just push out their Salt and Pepper Wings  General Tso  and Lo Mein  the typical American Chinese food you can get at your local Chinese spot  which is probably fresher. Also  I would not recommend anyone ordering seafood here. Mai Lei Wa is disgusting  overcrowded  rude staff  and overpriced. Spend your money elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the reviews  this place sounds like a hang out for the club kids after hours. But for day time dinning  there are much better food within a block in any direction. The wanton noodle soup was so so. The beef chow fun was okay but not something to write home about. The atmosphere is your typical American Chinese place. When I was there some one next to us order an egg drop soup! Damn  I have not hear anyone order that for a long long time.\n",
      "Im a big fan of this late night chinese place. It is one of the only restaurants that is open pretty damn late on the weekends. It gets super packed (afterhour) and becomes a total chaos! I still give this a 4 star b c they do a superb job getting your order right and getting you the tasty grub (everything taste AWESOME at 2 am). I always get their salt and pepper chicken wings and their House pan fried noodles. The servers are a bit rude but hey i dont blame them. They have to cater to drunk customers all night. They also have beer and liquor that they serve till a certain time. Overall i would def recommend this place to my fellow Yelpers to try out!\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been coming to this place since I started living in Philly. No matter what day  hour  or holiday I go  David's is always serving up great food. I've taken friends and family here countless times and they always feel the same way. Their egg drop soup is FANTASTIC  definitely one of (if not the) best bowl in Chinatown.\n",
      "So last night  we pour ourselves in a cab  and my companion directs the driver to David's Mai Lai Wah. Admittedly  it was difficult to focus on anything at that point  but three wise words from the driver wedged themselves into my exhausted  boozy brain: duck lo mein.   We arrived at David's and I excitedly scanned the menu - no duck lo mein in sight. Disheartened  I decided it wouldn't hurt to at least ask. The reaction from the waiter was the best reaction I have ever received upon ordering food  a combination of wonder and excitement and deep approval. Apparently  that cab driver is the only person who ever orders duck lo mein  and I am honored that he found my companion and I worthy recipients of his secret. So now  dear Yelpers  I pass on the secret to you - duck lo mein. It is exquisite  delicious  filling - juicy  succulent duck with slightly crispy skin  perfectly seasoned  and the noodles - oh  the noodles!  The portions are large and the price is small  so you'll have lunch the next day. I'll say it one more time  in case you missed it: duck lo mein.\n",
      "The worst service I've ever had in my entire life! We were waiting for awhile and the waiter totally ignored us and gave the table to the white people who were behind us.  The waiter was rude and told us to shut up when one of my co-workers was asking for the bill. You can totally see the difference in the service they gave toward white people vs. non-white. The food is okay but not worth waiting. Heed my advice  don't go here for Chinese food  there are much better places in Chinatown!  BTW  if I could give no stars I would!!\n",
      "Definitely one of the BEST after hours restaurants to hit up after a long night in the city.  I haven't been here in a while  but from what I remember  food was pretty good - although everything is probably good at 3am after a few drinks.  And I have to give shout outs to the wait staff and David for putting up with my drunk friends this late in the evening.  And I definitely agree with Dave H - quick service  considering the time of night...  I still have yet to try this place during the day...\n",
      "zento is my favorite sushi spot in Philadelphia.  i am a huge fan of their volcano roll  i make sure to get two every time!  it is a good place to have a birthday dinner! we had my birthday dinner there last night and the staff was very friendly and accommodating.  the decor and ambiance of the space is very nice.  i highly recommend zento.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best sushi I've had in a long time. My fav spot in the city used to be Raw  but I feel like you get more bang for your buck. I'm vegan and the vegetarian roll selection was awesome. Between my boyfriend and i  we ordered the Kanpyo Roll  cucumber roll   asparagus roll  grilled mushroom roll  the Hang on salmon roll  green roll  the real California roll  and the green roll. We also got miso soup  and edamame. Excellent food. The service was a little confusing because we had two waitresses but they were both very friendly and got everything that we needed. Highly recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was really pretty good.   But... this is a BYO that charges $10 corking fee. PER BOTTLE.  It wasn't really clearly communicated either  so the bill was a bit of a surprise.\n",
      "meh  i really have experienced better.   i ordered take-out sushi one day while at work. i chose zento because i had never been  and i wanted to try a different sushi restaurant (i was tempted to stick with makiman...i should have listened to my gut.)  i ordered some type of tropical roll and a futomaki roll to change things up. both were not great. the tropical roll was *slightly* more palatable than the futomaki which was completely inedible. i don't know what they stuffed into the futomaki but there was something that didn't agree with my taste buds. the tropical roll sounded better on the menu than it did in real life. at over 20 usd for my order  i felt like the rolls could have been better quality.  again  as i am wont to do in situations like this  i will return for a second visit just to make sure that i didn't hit this restaurant on a bad day  but i'm not going to go out of my way to return here since there are so many other sushi restaurants to try.\n",
      "I was so pleasantly surprised by my dinner here. I've been before and was non-plussed  so I wasn't expecting much. The appetizers were phenomenal and got me pretty excited to change my opinion.   The ceviche was delicious: peppery  citrusy and fresh . The tuna tartar was equally great and fresh  with crunchies on top and a (not overwhelming) drizzle of spicy sauce. Then: roast duck handrolls. Oh. Yea. I was basically beaming at this point. My rolls (salmon avocado and yellowtail scallion) were great  the chirashi was on point  even the teryaki dinners got great reviews and looked very hearty and well-presented.   The reverse happy hour has me looking forward to my next visit. The ambiance is also really nice  great for a date  girls night or dinner with parents.\n",
      "4 stars - just missing one due to service- a bit slow and our waitress was not too knowledgable in regards to questions! However- excellent  fresh sashimi and sushi and I love the atmosphere of this place. I've been here twice and both the upstairs and downstairs are super cute  intimate  and inviting :-) yum!\n",
      "I love the ambiance of this place. There are (at least) two dining areas  one upstairs and one downstairs. We were seated downstairs. The room has a nice high ceiling and is generally pretty dimly lit  with alcoves in the stone walls for candles. They have a couple of flatscreens high up on the walls showing black and white films -- I caught bits of two of them while I was there. One was a gangster film and the other seemed to be a Jet Li martial arts thing. Personally  I would expect a bit more of a sword/martial/samurai theme given the name of the restaurant but I really can't complain! Maybe they should show old jidaigeki films on those flatscreens to get a bit more on theme.   My friend and I had a coupon from LivingSocial for a seven course tasting menu for two. The coupon described a meal including choices like \\wagyu beef and zento's famous square sushi\\\"  but what we received was very different. The courses were as follows:   1. Miso soup with mussels - I am not a fan of miso soup  usually I find the fishy flavor of the dashi to be overpowering. However  this soup was exceptional. The flavors were really well balanced and the mussels were very tasty.   2. Calamari Salad - a few rings of deep fried calamari over greens. I liked it.  3. Crab cakes - two small handmade fried crab cakes. These were pretty plain and could have used a bit more sauce. They tasted fine  but nothing exceptional about it.  4. White fish carpaccio - three thin slices of white fish very well plated. Delicious and easy on the eyes!  5. Chicken Teriyaki - a couple of pieces of chicken  sauce  and a small mound of spinach and mushrooms. This dish was by far the most disappointing of the night as it was both small and boring. The greens were more exciting than the chicken. It tasted fine but nothing stood out about it  especially given that this should be an entree course. This is where the advertised Wagyu beef or square sushi should have been.  6. Sushi platter - Four nigiri sushi (salmon  tuna  white tuna  yellowtail) and half a roll. The sushi was incredible -- by far the best I've had in Philadelphia (for reference  I have had sushi at Pod  Mizu  Mixx  Aki  Green Garden  and the now defunct Genji). The roll had some sort of mayo based sauce in it (usually a no-no for me) but it was just perfectly balanced.   7. Dessert (shared) - Tofu cheesecake and red bean mochi ice cream. This was fine but unexciting. The cheesecake was better than expected but still pretty bland  and the ice cream was good. My girlfriend ordered some Tempura green tea icecream which I stole a bite of -- now THAT was a good dessert!   Additionally  the meal came with some non-alcoholic cocktails. I tried a green apple based drink and a white peach based drink  both of which were quite tasty.    Overall it felt like a reasonable value but mainly because of the Livingsocial price. I could see spending $35 plus tax and tip for this meal as a very nice value  but at $70 it would be overpriced.\"\n",
      "This place is great! Came here first time with an Amazon local deal  and loved it. Thanks to other Yelp reviews I found out it is a BYOB but you want sake they do have a lot of options for that too. I'm sure they have other drinks  but I'm not asking questions why they allow patrons to bring their own alcohol!  Had the sashimi platter the first time and the tuna pizza. (good!) Bought two more deals to come back in the future. There always seems to be something on Groupon/Living Social for Zento deals- look for them!  Also thanks to the website I found out the restaurant validates parking (completely free!) for the weekends (Starting Thursday) in the garage on 2nd in the block north of Chestnut St.\n",

      "In a sentence  don't waste your time.  We were advised of Steve's by the bellman at our hotel and were happy to walk just a few blocks to get there. That happiness was short lived.   The attitude of the gal taking our order was neither inviting or even cordiale. Bordering on rude. It summed up pretty much the entire vibe.  The ordering \\process\\\" was a mess as well. You order sandwiches at one window  pay get your receipt and go to the next line to order drinks and fries etc... Then you have to wait for them to call you twice. Not user friendly at all.  The food was way overpriced and just blah. Compared to Sonny's where I ate the day before. Steak was like Steakums! Ugh!   So  talk a nice walk or drive to Sonny's....or any other place than this. You'll get better service  MUCH better food and save almost half of your money.\"\n",
      "This place is great! Down to the fact that they're open late and centrally located and they have something for everyone. Chicken Philly and original and fries! If you don't know how to order they''ll help you too! This was one of the highlights of the trip!!!\n",
      "Avoid this place   unless you have $100 to tip them!! This was my  first time in Philadelphia and really wanted to try the infamous Philly steak sandwich that I have heard about all these years. After asking the locals and yelping several places. I decided on this place. It was memorial day so I expected it   to be busy and it was.  There was a line out the door.  I was waiting patiently with my family and the line was moving rather slowly. I noticed this young guy walk in with his freind and first thing out of his mouth is \\ is this the line your kidding me\\\" he then procedes to go the front of the line   and starts to talk one of the employees. He then asks his friend if he has $100 which I thought was odd. Then I noticed the guy was in standing in front of the chefs window motioning with hand signals what he wanted or did not want on his sandwiches. I thought that was odd  only to find out later. He had bribed the kitchen with his $100  to make his order first in front of all the other waiting customers. Naturally I was upset. So that's what this country has come to  if you have money you can cut in line to the front of normal hard working people. After waiting an hour I finally got my food. What a disappointment. I'm not sure what was worse   the food or the customer service. This is a Philly memorial day experience that I will never forget.\"\n",
      "First time having a cheesesteak in Philly.   Spicy fries were crisp and tasty. 9 10 I had a cheese steak with fried onions and mozzarella. It was not bad. Bread was fresh. 7 10\n",
      "Say what you will about the Philly cheesesteak debate  but Steve's is my favorite. The rolls are fresh  the meat is thinly sliced (which I prefer)  the staff is pleasant and the prices are decent for the area. Best of all  there's little to no wait. They're quick and simple. A must visit for cheesesteak lovers and locals all around.\n",
      "Our first time in Philadelphia we were looking forward to trying a cheesesteak. Someone had recommended Steve's to us. It was a quick walk from the hotel so that was perfect.  The cheesesteak on the other hand was absolutely horrible...no flavor  chewy meat  and hardly any meat in sandwich.  If I could give it no stars I would.  The fries were good but you can't really mess those up.  Such a disappointment.  I never have posted a review before but this was so bad that I felt I had to.  Hope we can find a great cheesesteak while we are here!\n",
      "Expensive for one. Charges you extra for mushroom!!!! Mushroom and peppers are essentials of the cheese steak..  However  chicken chese steak and the philly cheese steak are both under expectations and actually i had to throw out half of both cause they tasted very bad..\n",
      "The staff was rude. They were absent-minded.  Forgot our fries  and screamed at us in front of customers.  I was embarrassed and nervous to eat my steak  in fear that one of the waitstaff may have sabotaged my meal. I can not come here again. I guess this is my \\welcome to Philly\\\" experience.\"\n",

      "Great new spot  as you can tell because there's always a wait for a table. I've been to Harper's Garden twice  once for a light dinner and drinks (sitting inside) and once for lunch (sitting outside on huge patio).   1st visit: We sat INSIDE for light dinner. The service was fantastic  although at the very end he was kind of slow to bring the check  but overall great throughout the entire night. The cocktails were great  and the beer choices were OK  would like to see some better craft options considering the Philly and Tria reputation for great beer. Our small bites of food were great  I loved the pulled MOZZARELLA with fig  sooo delicious. The feta TOAST and SAUSAGE FLATBREAD were also delicious  although small portions for the price tag. The inside dining area got a tad loud for my liking  voices were echoing loud and it was hard to talk to my friends across the table from me. The 4 of us got 3 drinks each  and 1 small plate of food  and our bill was almost $300.   2nd visit: We sat OUTSIDE on the massive  gorgeous outdoor patio. There were 7 of us  on lunch break from the office. The patio is great for conversations with coworkers  because inside was too loud. But the patio got really hot toward the end of our meal  the sun shifted and there wasn't much shade  so we were roasting in our business clothes. Still  it was a beautiful setting for lunch. Their patio is so pretty and well decorated. This visit  the service was super slow. The food itself took nearly 45 minutes to reach our table from the time we ordered  and the server disappeared at the end of the meal when we needed the check. We were 30 minutes late to our office after lunch break. The food was very good (once we finally got it!)  I had the SWORDFISH ($20)  which I thought was worth the money and very tasty. The portion size was perfect  unlike some of their other plates which are pretty small. The CARROTS Appetizer was amazing! Must try that again  the sauce was delicious. The burger didn't look very big or juicy  but my coworkers ordered that so I don't know how it tasted. For all the food we ordered  I expected a huge bill  but it was only $160 for 7 people (no drinks).   Moral of the story: Come here for the best outdoor patio around. Great food  but relatively small plates  so don't come starving or you'll over-order and be broke. Also watch the drink prices  or stick to non-alcoholic  because drinks are not cheap. Best advice: Make a reservation! They are always busy.\n",
      "Decided to stop by here after a long weekend retreat. In short  food and service was exceptional. We were promptly greeted and seated at our table. If was a beautiful day with a slight breeze and their outdoor area was well kept and relaxing. The pergola and plants were easy on the eyes and the bulb wire lighting looked beautiful as the night drew near.  We ordered about it 6 or 7 plates to share between the 3 of us and we all were satisfied at the end. Presentation  taste and temperature were just right. Our server was attentive and kind and she took care of us well throughout the duration of our stay.\n",
      "I discovered this place while running some errands during my lunch break. The outside seating area is what caught my attention. A few weeks later  I was finally able to come here with some friends to try it out. The restaurant is immediately inviting. The light fixtures and plants in the outside seating create a garden patio feel  which is perfect for summer brunch! The inside decor is just as chic. We waited at the inside bar for about 5 minutes until we were seated at a table outside. After waiting inside though  I feel like you can't go wrong wherever you sit as the entire restaurant is gorgeous. Moving on to the food.  I ordered from the brunch menu. I started out with a Strawberry Swing from the brunch cocktail section of the menu. It was a mixture of vodka  sparkling rosé  lemon and strawberries. It was perfect for a hot summer's day. I ended up ordering a second round! For my entree  I ordered the Sunny-Side Eggs. It was topped with cheese and served with grilled bread that was toasted to perfection.   My overall experience was enjoyable. I would absolutely come back here. There's only a couple  very minor things I would note: 1)The entree serving size is smaller than expected 2) Our waitress had to check with the chef for any entree modifications. Even if it was a minor change such as excluding an ingredient from the dish. Other than that  I would say this place is a perfect addition to the Philly food scene.\n",
      "I'm a fan!  Decor and ambience at this place is great.  We lucked out with outdoor seating on a bearable summer night  but the indoor seating looked inviting too.  Food and drink menu are legit.  Not cheap  but not overly expensive.  It was guys night out and we ordered a ton of Old fashions.  They were not weak and totally got the job done.  From all the dishes we ordered  the burger was phenomenal.  The rest of the apps and entrees were delicious as well.  Service was fantastic and you could see the floor managers making their rounds to make sure things were in order.  It's new and trendy spot that didn't disappoint.  Rarely am I blown away by a first experience at a new restaurant  but this is an exception.  I'm game for another night at this amazing place!\n",
      "Came here for lunch with some coworkers after we walked past the cute exterior and it did not disappoint! While we had to sit inside due to rain  I would recommend trying to sit outside if that's possible  the garden feel adds to the charm of the space. However make sure you make a reservation  this place fills up VERY quickly.   For lunch  I split the mushroom flatbread and the frisée salad with a coworker. The frisée salad was good  but I was not overly crazy about the olive vinaigrette. However  I can not stop thinking about the mushroom flatbread!! I genuinely think this was one of the best dishes I've had in a very long time - both of us who split the flatbread agreed! Another coworker enjoyed his burger so much he sent me the picture to include in the review.\n",
      "Had a fantastic lunch here  sitting outside on a sunny  summer afternoon.  We shared a number of small plated - the jerk plantain  mozzarella with figs  ricotta toast  spring salad and smoked gnocchi.  All of the dishes were great  with subtle blends of flavors and use of fresh herbs.  The gnocchi is a definite recommendation.  For dessert we had the turmeric frozen custard  which was great - really imaginative and served with pieces of grilled mango and pineapple.\n",
      "So over crowded. Especially with little kids at 9pm. Not nearly enough bar tenders. We used a groupon which was totally not worth it. The Groupon was $20 for \\blue\\\" games unlimited and 30 in chips. The ratio between blue to other colored games was about 1 to 10. So almost impossible on a Saturday to play any blue games. I will not be back. Also 1 hour 30 mins wait for a table  not worth it\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously there is a selection of games  billiards  and bars. However  these come at a price that isn't cheep. I usually enjoy the food here as well but it depends what you order. If you stick to the basics like burgers and chicken I think you'll be in good shape. I wish the credits on your D and B card lasted longer but they seem to drain fast and he grab machines are as hard as they get.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've updated my review after eating here and having horrible service. Let my tale unfold.....  I came here for one of my friends birthdays. We made this abundantly clear to the waiter who did immediatly take our drink orders. That was the only good part. It took a LONG time for our drinks to arrive  and not many of them were alcoholic. Our waiter had to be called over constantly  and I only got one drink the entire time  and that was the first one I ordered. Our waiter looked like he should have been a model and if he quit to do this then he's a moron  because he was HORRIBLE (his name was allen).   I can see why people do not like this place  and I will give it two starts because of the games  and the bartenders which I currently have not had any issues with...except the games are obviously over priced but comon  don't you expect that?  Now for the rest of the review....  I've been to both dave and busters Columbus blvd  and Dave and busters Franklin mills mall. This will (obviously) be about Columbus blvd because this is the establishment I am currently rating.   I have been here once that I can remember (a long time ago when I was a little kid but I can't remember that) and it was a good time. The Bouncer at the front was ok  I had to get money from the ATM so I could park and get my 5 dollars back and they let me without any issues (except the fat bouncer tried to ignore my question of where the ATM was. Luckily there was another guy there and he understood my situation and let me pass w/o my id so I could get money  go bak to the parking person  pay them and get my license back and 5 dollar off coupon).   People complain that the parking is 11 dollars. So did I considering that the Franklin mills mall location is free to park  but you do get 5 dollars back in a coupon so it really isn't so terrible.   After that we went to the game room to play games and it wasn't too bad. I did make sure my valuables were safe in my pockets because there were some sketchy people there but I did not let that stop me and my gf from having fun. We played games and won tickets and yea some of the games are def over priced  but just do the eat and play combo and you get a card  and sign up online and you get more game play and there's plenty of other ways to get extra game play too.   I did have a drink and yes it was over priced  but it was fri night and your in they city  what do you expect? They do have a late night happy hour from sun-thurs so I'm going to try and hit that up at some point. The drink did seem like it coulda been stronger but they actually measure out the shots for the drinks so that's why it might seem weak (customary practice at national establishments such as this  applebees does it too).   The place was roamed by many staff who definitely tried to keep the place clean by sweeping up or picking up glasses that people were done with. I'm sure the floor could have been cleaner but it's a huge arcade with food drink and many people running around  can't expect the taj mahal of cleanliness.   The bathrooms here are disgusting. I was appalled at how they were and did not even feel safe going to the rest room.   I've been here a few times now and this is what I have come up with. HORRIBLE waiter service  decent bartenders  and a not bad game room. Honestly  if you want to eat here just go to the bar and order your meals. You'll have better service and it'll be a LOT less of a wait to get a drink (any type!)\n",

      "I live in Florida but I'm originally from Philly  I took my family here non Easter  granted the place was packed. But wow what a disgust  when I went to order a drink the top was sticky from ppl spilling drinks  I had to ask the bartender to please wipe it down. So I put my name in for a table so we could eat. Omg  just walking to the table I was disgusted the floor was sticky there was food on the floor from previous ppl. I was so disgusted I wanted to turn around and leave. I didn't since we waited about 45 mins for the table. They got my sons order wrong. The whole thing was a nightmare.\n",
      "You have to pay for parking here. The games get crowded so dont expect to quickly play the good games. I feel the D&B at Franklin Mills is much more spacious and has better games. It has free parking too. :)  The good thing is that they are much more strict here with the age requirement. You must be 21 or older or must be accompanied by someone 25 or older to get through the door. This helps remove all the young teens from the atmosphere but you still have kids around.\n",
      "It sucks that you've got to pay for parking. I'm trying to go for the gold card since I always lose my cards whenever I go to one of these. If you're ever bored and have nothing better else to do in Philly  come and visit this place. It's located near the BF bridge and a few blocks from other cool restaurants and clubs.\n",
      "Okay  so just an update.  I have been to Indian Restaurants in Little India in Singapore  Bali  Indonesia  Rome  Paris  and Munich  London  and Dublin  and of course many in the states....  This is still my favorite! Glad it's local for me when I am 'home' in the states! :)\n",
      "Plenty of food - fresh naan  rice  chicken/ lamb/ vegetarian curries  salads  etc. Not all of it is amazing in flavor (it's a buffet after all!) -- but you'll be sure to find something that you like. Desserts are great and a cup of tea or coffee is included with the dinner buffet (maybe the lunch one too). What's nice is that the place is generally full  even on weekdays. The restaurant is deocrated nicely but still has a bit of a cafeteria feel because of the buffet. The price is $11.95 for the dinner buffet and I think $8.95 for the lunch one. They serve beers and alcohol too.  I'm not giving this place more stars only because I wasn't very impressed with the flavor of the curries. It's worth checking out once though!\n",
      "A solid buffet with all of the typical and usual favorites. It's a nice  casual place for a quick meal.\n",
      "This is amongst the best Indian food I've had on the East Coast. The chicken has been perfectly tender on each of the dishes I have ordered and the dal makhani deserves SPECIAL praise! Delivery folks don't come up to my apartment even when there is place to park  which is a bit of a downer - but for food alone  this is an easy 5/5 for me. Keep it up please!\n",
      "Having grown up with Indian food almost every night  I'm quite picky when it comes to Indian restaurants. I almost never go for the buffet option because there is never enough flavor  however  I had the dinner buffet at New Delhi and I was amazed at how flavorful and spicy it was for a buffet. I also loved that they had a plethora of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options and even had selections beyond your traditional Indian buffet. The pricing is also super reasonable for an all you can eat place. I will definitely be back!\n",
      "I've gone here a handful of times  maybe more  but definitely less than ten visits  and I've been disappointed every time.  I've ordered both the buffet on the weekends  which offers a richer variety than during the week  and I've also ordered a la carte items from the menu.  The buffet offers plentiful self-servings of rice pudding which I like.  The latter contains pine nuts in a creamy  smooth sauce and is quite tasty  though everything else served in the restaurant is lackluster.    If you order off of the regular menu you can probably specify the spiciness  but the buffet items are more or less bland.  The naan is unacceptably soggy and has probably been sitting under the dimmed buffet lights for an extended period of time.  If you prefer to have freshly baked naan  order off of the a la carte menu.  The mango lassi is not tart as one would expect the classic Indian drink to be  but is instead a shake.  The restaurant does not claim that it is a \\lassi\\\" per se but a \\\"mango shake.\\\"  It is simply a concoction of milk and mango ice cream  the latter being available as a complimentary dessert that accompanies the buffet.  Granted  there aren't too many tasty Indian restaurants in the vicinity  and this place offers delivery service.  I ordered delivery once because I suddenly had a craving for Indian food  and ordered chicken saag (and specified \\\"spicy\\\" which improved the flavors a bit) with naan.  The dish automatically came with rice.     Though New Delhi is indeed a sit-down restaurant  I'd prefer to patronize Rice and Spice on 42nd and Chestnut  which  though regrettably lacks a welcoming ambiance  serves what I consider to be above-average Indian fare.  A problem with Rice and Spice is that you probably have to bring a friend or two if you want variety.  The mango lassi there is actually a tart lassi and has a fairly thick consistency.  I've heard good things about Rice and Spice's chicken biryani and the serving portions are generous.  The waiters at New Delhi somewhat make you feel rushed because they clear the table very quickly for you when you order the buffet.  They are nice in offering to bring dessert (which comes with the buffet)  but sometimes you want to spend a bit more time finishing off your plate before moving on.    Those were my two cents about New Delhi.  I wonder if it's necessary for me to continue with a review of Rice and Spice.  I think Indian food in general is something you have to have a specific craving for  and when you do have a proclivity for it  it lasts for only a short period of time and after multiple consecutive visits either to one particular restaurant or to several.  Service: B+ Taste: B-\"\n",
      "Service: Seated right away. Drinks right away. Removed our plates very eagerly. Reminded us that dessert was included on the buffet.   Food: Good variety. All tasted excellent. Everything tasted fresh. Constant turn around at buffet. Def worth the price.\n",
      "I've only had Indian food about twice prior to going to New Delhi. I've heard about this place from my friends and decided to take my boyfriend here. The price is good for college students like myself  and the food is good too. My boyfriend never had indian food before so we decided to go with the buffet style so that he could try whatever he likes. He really liked the chicken tikka marsala and naan  which is my perfect combination too. Then we asked for the dessert that came with the buffet. Our bill came out to be $30 including the tax&tip (we didn't get drinks)  I'm thinking next time we come again  we'll just get the chicken tikka marsala and lots of naan!\n",
      "I like to sample as many dishes as I can at Indian restaurants  so I went for the lunch buffet. The palak paneer was amazing! Everything I tried was delicious. They had a good number of vegetarian friendly options. I've had better naan  but it was still good. The restaurant was very clean and the staff was friendly. They also have great drink prices.\n",
      "The dinner buffet had just enough dishes and the taste was great. The naan was soft. The only thing that could be better was the mango Lassi. Not enough mango taste. The food was very good   the service fast and friendly.  Will definitely eat there again.\n",
      "I love their fries!! Been here twice and the falafel pita was better on first time. Second time it was a bit wet and cold  maybe too much sauce or something? However the taste was still good! Would go again and definitely recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good falafel  but honestly not as amazing as one would expect given the hype. They serve a quality and consistent product but the flavor is by no means on another level. The fries are mediocre. The sauces are pretty good and the shakes are just pretty good as well. Gave them 5 stars cause they're still doing a good job on everything and the place is clean.\n",
      "This place is pretty dope. We tried the falafel sandwich  shawarma spice fries  and Tehani shake - all amazing! The staff was super helpful too. Best in Philly!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A little taste of Israel on Sansom.. well there are a few tastes of Israel on Sansom but it's always welcome :) the coconut shake was by far the best flavor of all my friends and I have tried. The falafel is pretty great too. I do wish there was more seating  although I get that its meant to be a small  in and out place for lunch. But back to the coconut shake... I day dream about it. Let's just leave it at that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think this was the worst meal I have ever had in philly. We got there at 6:00  no fries. The falafel was so cold  mushy and tasteless. Something on my sandwich was so salty that my eyes teared up  I told the guy behind the counter and he just stared at me with a dumb look on his face and said nothing. Just came home from a trip to Tel Aviv  even the rest stops have better falafel than this place. Never against  garbage meal.\n",
      "Great place. You order at the counter and then get a seat  if one's available. You can't claim a seat before ordering. Got two specials: the divorced eggs and tres leches pancakes. The eggs were very good and the pancakes were great. Portions are generous. They take LevelUp.\n",
      "They had a \\Caribbean pulled pork sandwich\\\" as a special  and my goodness  it was heavenly. I've been here four times now  and I haven't been disappointed once! It's always delicious  and the service is fantastic (at least while I've been here at 2pm or later).  The pulled pork must've been a lunch special because they put out a different specials menu after 5pm. I asked about it (after seeing it on their Instagram)  and the cashier asked the chef if he could still make one (which he did). I can't think of many places that would do this. I'd usually be told it's not available. I always tip a little extra here despite there not technically being waiters.  I've only had lunch and dinner here  and the portions are very generous for the price (and they have free water). I'll continue to return.\"\n",
      "I found this place last minute because the place I wanted to go to was closed on Mondays. I mostly picked this place because they have alot of avocados on the menu. This is such a cute place  well decorated and made it feel like you were home. The service was excellent. The cashier and the waiter was super nice and friendly and was very attentive!  So you walk in the door  and you walk to the counter  order your food and then they will give you a number. You get to pick your own seat and they will bring your food to you! There is a big board with the menu in the front for you to look at.  I had the avocado blt with a side of fries. OMG the sandwich was HUGE! I paid 14$ and it was so worth it  I could only eat a small half. The bread was delicious! The bacon was cooked a little too much  so it was hard and it was hard to bite into the sandwich  but it could also be that I couldn't fit the whole thing in my mouth anyway. The avocado was really good  it was like not mushy like alot of places.   My friend had a hot chocolate and miles burger. She finished the whole thing. She liked it. She even said that it wasn't greasy than it looked. (Might just be how the bread looks).   I'd totally go back here. In fact  I'm bringing my boyfriend back. :)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Got the shrimp and grits - loved it! Really cool combination with the guac on the side. Cool place  reasonable prices. Can be quite noisy at times but all in all  good as a brunch place\n",
      "A solid option for breakfast  sandwiches  or a light meal. They also have GF options  thank you! But the service always feels a bit short-staffed.\n",
      "One of my new favourite eateries!  Miles is the perfect place to go anytime of the day.  Breakfast? Lunch? Dinner? Snack? Consistently delicious and fresh every time with a fantastic  health conscious menu.  The interior is cute  servings are huge  and the prices are great-- definitely a good place to have a casual meal with friends.  Bonus points for being a BYO and next door to MAGPIE.\n",
      "Came here for Sunday brunch and loved the ambience - it was a cute space with a nice interior. You grab a table and go up to order at the cashier. A lot of great options for lovers of both sweet and savory brunch.   Had the creme brûlée French toast with fresh berries on top. It was delicious and not too sweet  topped w powdered sugar and a fresh whipped cream as well as a side of syrup.   Also tried the Mexican breakfast burrito which was jam packed with sausage  cheese  beans  peppers  and all sorts of yum.   Overall lovely atmosphere and great food!\n",
      "Now I've only been to Miles Table for brunch  but I have been twice! The great thing about Miles Table is the casual atmosphere and the delicious food. You order at the counter  they give you a number and then you are free to post up anywhere. Both times I've gotten lucky and I've been able to eat outside. They have three tables outside that are perfectly shaded by a tree. Perfect for brunch! *** ALSO NOTE IT IS BYOB***  The first time I went I had the bagel and lox. I feel like this is a staple and it was good here. I enjoyed it though it didn't blow me away. Then again  I think it's pretty hard to take such a basic and really blow people away.... HOWEVER....  The second time I had the huevos rancheros and WHOA. It blew me away. The meal looked like a masterpiece and the portion was huge. It was phenomenal! It was almost too pretty to eat! (Ah who am I kidding I was so enticed that I didn't even have time to snap a picture before my fork was in it). It did not disappoint and I would certainly suggest it to any friends who make the stop to Miles Table!\n",
      "I had high hopes for this place - I work right across the street and would pass by at lunch and look and the setting of the fire pits  ping pong table and shuffle board.  I thought - cool - fun place.    Finally - I asked a friend to meet me after work.  First - too many young folks and tourists - so hence the ridiculous markup on drinks and below average food.  I know it's an outdoor setting  but the beer and water were warm - not a good start!!    It went downhill from there with the food being just \\ok\\\".  I wouldn't return  nor would I recommend until they improve the menu and offer more daily specials.\"\n",
      "i really thought the beer garden was gonna be at the field of where the liberty bell is lol but nope it's set up in the empty space between 2 bulidings~  still works!  seems like everybody was enjoying themselves.  we saw a lot of people going in and out... we also realized that it's VERY easy to just dine and dash haha .. i'm not encouraging this though lol   we ordered their specialty cocktails and some munchies~ the cheese curd really hit the spot!! my steak frites was also delicious!! for $14  it's hard to beat!  but i will comment on that even though it was well seasoned and grilled nicely  the quality of the steak was lacking... so don't expect prime rib quality or a porterhouse--- however  if you're hungry and just want something to munch on  it's definitely not a bad choice!  also  the fries that accompanied it were sooo tasty!  nothing less from Michael Schulson lol  so if you haven't checked it out yet this summer~ definitely worth a shot!\n",
      "I was disappointed with the service when I visited here on Saturday evening. I ordered a beer on nitro and it was served with 90 percent foam. I asked the bartender  and she responded indignantly that \\it will settle.\\\" When the beer settled 20 minutes later it was warm  flat  and about 3 4 full. To top it off  the beer was listed as $6 (apparently pre-tax) on the menu but rang up as $7. With better beer gardens in town that can actually handle pouring what they have on tap  I would not recommend this place to anyone.\"\n",
      "IBG offers a good use of its old town space  and has a good selection of draft  bottled  and canned beer. it is not a bargain though. 2 drafts after work will set you back $14. that is not excessive  but for that fourteen bucks i'd sure like a glass  not a crummy plastic cup.\n",
      "I would normally give this place five stars because the venue is fantastic. It's beautiful and has plenty of seating with great activities. Good beer selection. Bartenders are fairly good. So why only 3 stars? The food was abysmal for the price and there was a bathroom attendant in the womens' bathroom on Saturday night of Memorial Day Weekend. 1. This position is unnecessary esp. here but if it is to give an individual a job  fine. 2. She was incredibly adamant about no transgender or males in the women's bathroom. Technically  this venue is supposed to have unisex bathrooms according to city law but aside from that  the aggressiveness with which she was screening some women was downright absurd. Only steps away from a strong LGBT history and community  this is NOT how a business should be isolating themselves.\n",
      "Oh another beer garden? I'm down. I actually really like this place. It's large and semi-covered and not filled with a million kids. I'm sorry - I love kids just as much as the next gal  but they're taking over these pop-ups. I have been to what I think are the main 4 (SSHP  PHS  Oval  and this one) - and I think they all have something different to offer. This place just seems like a nice place to grab a beer and play some cornhole (my favorite summer activity). I didn't eat  but the peach shandy is as delicious as they say- highly recommend. I also went during a light rain shower  so it wasn't busy - which people I know have mentioned.  I'm diggin' IBG.\n",
      "What are great outdoor space right across the street from the Library Bell.  It's an L shape space with plenty of sitting area.  There are games like checker  genga  connect four etc on every table. It's fun to have the games specially after a few drinks.  The drinks were good  but not very strong. The staff was really friendly and attentive. I didn't have any of the food but the aroma was nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great outdoor space with games  drinks  and food!  The cocktails are decently priced and pretty strong  and the food  all of which is bar food  is pretty good as well. Mostly I just like coming because it's a great space for enjoying a sunny day with friends or significant others.\n",
      "Great beer garden. Really cool location right across from the liberty bell.   Diverse selection of beers. I tried evil genius I love lamp. Great name and delicious beer.  True beer garden set up. They have plenty of space and several bars. Corn hole ping pong and various other bar games.   Def worth a visit.\n",
      "I haven't even gotten home yet and I'm writing this review. That's how good our experience was! We decided on Ocean Prime at the last minute and didn't have reservations for a Friday night. The hostess found us a table for five despite a packed house. Our server Jadyn was fantastic  super attentive and friendly. We were celebrating my dad's birthday and he said the wedge salad and carrot cake were the best he's had. He also raved about the pork dish. I had the blackened snapper and it was TO DIE FOR. White chocolate key lime tart was also really good. We will no doubt be back again.\n",
      "The food is great here  however the host staff at the front (in particular a woman with dyed red hair and accentuated eyeliner) however leaves much to be desired. Despite having a completely empty restaurant at 5:30pm they refused to sit me while my husband parked our car at our building. Very poor service and a nonsensical rule (especially when we were a party of two and nobody was in the dining room).\n",
      "\n",
      "Had a wonderful dinner at Ocean Prime to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday this past weekend. We had chosen the location because we were seeing a show at the Academy of Music nearby. During our meal  every single member of the staff that we interacted with was extremely friendly. They knew it was a special occasion and made it feel as such. One member of the staff approached us for a photograph and a printed copy was given to us as a keepsake for the evening. We thought that was a very nice touch.  As for the food and drinks  everything was exceptional. I was surprised by the number of reasonably-priced bottles of wine available. We started with the shrimp cocktail  which included 4 very large shrimp (a good-sized portion compared to some other fine-dining establishments in the area). The presentation on the shrimp cocktail was very unique as the shrimp were placed in a bowl of cocktail sauce that had dry ice underneath to give a very cool  smoky effect. Our entrees were fantastic as well. I had the scallops  which were cooked perfectly and were larger than expected. My girlfriend claimed that the salmon was \\perhaps the best she's ever had\\\". We shared the chocolate cake to complete our meal. Again  the presentation was very nice as the kitchen wrote a nice little birthday message in chocolate on the plate.  In conclusion  we had a fantastic meal from start to finish. We would absolutely come back again and have already recommended the restaurant to friends and family.\"\n",
      "This is not my typical restaurant choice as a vegetarian that doesn't eat fish and seafood but I dined here for a family member's birthday.   The restaurant is very upscale with high ceilings and partial upper level.  The padded rounded booth provided extremely comfortable seating. The ambiance was very nice and while fancy  felt cozy.  I had the house salad that was a very generous size and very good. My sides of Brussel sprouts and truffle mac and cheese were tasty as well.  Others chose the surf and turf special which is being offered on Sundays. They thought the filet was extremely good. Dessert choices included creme brûlée and carrot cake.  The carrot cake was delicious!  Service was excellent from the time we were seated to the time we paid.  Someone was always filling your water glass. Timing of food from the kitchen was excellent too.\n",
      "Yes  it's a chain  but... Apparently the corporate office allows a lot of leeway to the executive chefs and management.  It doesn't feel like a chain  only if you know exactly what to look for.  Food is great  had oysters and a shellfish cobb salad  which I could probably eat twice a week for months on end. Service was very good.  Friendly  fast  good attention to detail in busing/re-setting the table  very professional.  One suggestion (and this is not a criticism  just hoping to improve your fine establishment):  Better bar training of the waitstaff.  I'm particular about my Martinis.  I'd like to know the full selection of gins  our server wasn't familiar with them.  I was very specific in requesting it stirred (I asked twice) and to have our server come to the table and aggressively shake it before pouring it out was disappointing.  Younger people don't necessarily have a lot of familiarity with cocktails  I know  but this is important  and it's a relatively easy way to improve the dining experience.  So  great atmosphere  solid menu  excellent execution  professional staff (hat tip to G.M. Frank Hamm  who stopped by every table  chatted with us about chains with great candor  greeted us on the way in and got our coats on the way out.  That's a hands on G.M.!)\n",
      "I went for restaurant week lunch last week with two friends  and we enjoyed wonderful service and a great meal. We made a reservation  and even though we were a little late  they sat us right away. Our server was so attentive and friendly and the bussing staff was on their game! As soon as we finished something  the plate was cleared or our water was refilled. For restaurant week  they obviously had a set three course menu  but our server told us we could look at the regular menu and make small substitutions if we wanted. I ended up ordering straight off the restaurant week menu and was not disappointed. I split the crab cake sandwich and the salmon with a friend. They were both delicious! The crab cake was so crabby (ha!) and the salmon glaze was to die for. The inside of the restaurant is so spacious and the decor is fitting for a seafood restaurant. I really enjoyed my whole experience!\n",

      "After now reading the other reviews  maybe Karma was not on my side when I was there. The service was horrific. We waited 10 minutes at the table before our server came and that was after he asked for her. The food was mediocre  other than the shrimp cocktail which was superb. My lobster tail was undercooked and the salad was small. The price of the wine is outrageous! I understand doubling bottle prices  but there's are tripled. A glass of La Crema Russian River Vallet was $29.00 a glass at the bar.  Really?? Opus One maybe... Very disappointed.\n",

      "This place is a good place to stop for a quick dinner that fulfills a specific craving for me.  I've had and loved authentic Mexican fare but I sometimes just crave the Americanized stuff I grew up with.  Las Margaritas delivers that at a fair price  with decent quality and accompanied by margaritas that are tasty and strong. The enchiladas are cheesy and the chips are crispy and fresh.  You definitely won't find anything worthy of a Michelin star here  but you will leave satisfied and  if you like margaritas  more than a little buzzed.   My only complaint is that the wait staff always assumes that my boyfriend is paying and thanks him  even when I have handed them the check presenter full of cash myself.  It's a small annoyance  but an annoyance nonetheless.\n",

      "This place was good! Came here one day for some food that would really fill our bellies! We came around 4 on a Friday. It was busy but we walked in and got a table right away. The chips were crunchy and the salsa was chunky- Delicious!! We both got margaritas- my boyfriend had the coronarita and I had strawberry. Both were really good and pretty strong too! We got table-side guacamole- which was delicious! My only critique was the timing. We ordered our meals and received them before they came by to make the guacamole! So  needless to say our table was packed with food! WHOOPS! :) My fajitas were a really nice portion and my boyfriend got a combo that was scrumptious as well.   Overall  affordable Mexican with large portions. I wouldn't say it was the best I ever had but it was great for the price! I would come again!\n",
      "its delicious!  the margarita's are bangin!  I usually get the chicken chimicangas and they are like CRACK!  only thing is...when its busy  prepare to wait and its crowded!  go early.\n",

      "If a place is called Las Margaritas  they'd better have phenomenal margaritas and this place lived up to it's name.  They serve big portions of food so you get your money's worth. If you come from Mexico  CA or TX  you'll have higher standards when it comes to authentic food so I recommend to order anything else other than the tacos because the carne asada lacks flavor and is dry. I have to rate a 4 out of 5 because it would be unfair to rate based on West Coast standards. For what I can find in Philly  this is the spot to get your fix. I love Las Margaritas' cheese enchiladas... mmm  sooo cheesy. I also like their camarones del diablo.\n",

      "Hot and new? Not  more like hot and nasty ... I was not impressed ....I had the mac n cheese burger and wanted to vomit\n",
      "came to oh brother because a friend recommended it as \\one of the best cheese steaks\\\" in philly. they were wrong.  we got some cheese steaks  bacon cheese fries and onion rings  and a milk shake. the steaks were... less than phenomenal. the meat was tough  and the bread lacked the structural integrity that i expect out of a grade a cheesesteak.  the appetizers and the shakes were good  but it's hard to imagine how those could be poorly made. it was a decent meal.\"\n",
      "The food is good.  Ordered a basic cheese burger and truffle fries.  The problem is pricing.  It's waaaay to expensive for basic food served in baskets and you are expected to clean your own tables.  Burger does not come with fries.. so a burger and truffle fries = $16.50 (no drink).   Obviously  it's due to the location.. but for this  I would go to shake shack every time.   I imagine this place will stay in business for \\X\\\" amount of time because of tourists.  If you're local  you'll know better places for less.\"\n",
      "We stopped in for lunch today and had a great experience! Tried the cheesesteak with wiz and fried onions  brisket sandwich  Nutella shake and fries. Everything was delicious! Service was good and fast. The fries were especially fluffy and crispy -- very good. Also  there is a discount for Police and Fire Dept!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We live in the neighborhood and finally made it into Oh Brother. My husband had the brisket sandwich and loved it  the meat was very tender and flavorful. I had a cheeseburger and was quite surprised at how good it was. And the bacon cheese fries were delicious. As an added bonus they are open to 4am on weekends!\n",

      "I got the gyro \\platter\\\" for lunch  which was dry  uninspired  and nothing like a deconstructed gyro. Worst of all  it came with \\\"vegetables\\\" which looked more like poop. Tasted that way  too. There are better places in Fairmount for lunch  and they won't serve you poop  either.\"\n",
      "So I'm not a huge Greek food fan  but the souvlaki from Zorba's was quite amazing. The restaurant is a classic little Philly spot that doesn't look like much from the outside  but let's it's food so the talking. The people i was with  who do like Greek food  were gushing about the excellent hummus and Greek salad...   I will happily return to Zorba's again.\n",
      "Authentic Greek taverna in the heart of Philly Fairmount neighborhood.  This family owned restaurant features a fantastic selection of tasty Greek food. Whether for a salad  a Gyro or and entree you can't go wrong with this classic local favorite.\n",
      "We just had dinner at this Greek restaurant that is A 10 minute walk from the art museum. We were seated in the back room that was really cute and the waitress was nice. I ordered the lamb shrank with vegetables and my husband roasted lamb with vegetables and potatoes. The lamb shank was very good  the roasted lamb was good. The mixed vegetables was a gray mash of peas cabbage and carrots cooked to death and they were just warm not hot. They tasted OK but look terrible. The waitress said that was how the vegetables were prepared. The food seem to be just dump together on a plate and didn't look very appetizing. We also split a Greek salad which for some strange reason didn't have any greens but the cucumbers and tomatoes and olives were tasty. I will try this place again and order something different.\n",
      "Best Greek food hands down. This is my Greek go-to restaurant. I love everything on the menu but the grilled octopus is a must try. Very generous portions and the Saganaki is also to die for too. Quaint little BYO. Wonderful  and very good looking staff  )  Only problem I have is the gyro meat. Its the frozen kind. Please don't deny this Zorba. I've eaten plenty of gyro's in my day. The only reason I am adding this in my review is with the hope that the owner see's it and makes a change! This slight discrepancy however does not denote my star rating. I am so very pleased every time I eat here  they deserve 5 stars in my book.\n",
      "Food was delish and tasty  but more importantly - service was superb! We asked if the restaurant served wine  and they told us it was BYOB. So a few minutes after sitting down  hubby and I got dressed to go out and get smthg in nearby bar - that's when owner told us he found a bottle of wine and gave it to us on the house! That was so nice  genuine and thoughtful! Excellent  cozy  yummy place for lunch  with warm hospitality -highly recommend!\n",
      "\n",
      "One of my favorite restaurants in the Fairmont area.  Zorba's is a BYOB with traditional Greek dishes. The prices are reasonable as well. They have an appetizer sampler which is really good and filling in of itself. As a fan of lamb  I've tried several of the stewed dishes and never been let down.  It's a quaint restaurant you should definitely try out.\n",
      "Zorba's is one of those Fairmount staples. I prefer to go there when I can get an outside table  or when I visit with a particular group of friends who also share in my sentiment of fondness. Now what the heck took me so long to experience Zorba's delivery?! Shame on me. It's the same delicious food  just in my pajamas in front of my TV.   Having experienced a day that could only be fixed by delivery  my husband handled all of the order details. I believe he placed directly with them  as we were able to pay in cash when the delivery guy arrived. The wait time was standard- I don't recall it arriving early nor do I recall being antsy about its whereabouts.   I'm no stranger to the Imam Baldi. I think every time I have this eggplant in red sauce soufflé  I go on the record that this dish can turn me into a vegetarian. It came with the standard sides of rice  veggies and potatoes  all separated by little dividers as to not mingle.   We were first timers to the Skordalia. Think extra  extra whipped mashed potatoes with extra  extra garlic. Move over (already fabulous hummus)  you may have just been replaced in our repertoire. Okay  I kid. We'll just get both and have leftovers.  Speaking of leftovers  we totally were able to split our order into two meals. Score!    Love that fresh bread they put on the table? Don't worry  you get that too.   I'll still visit their actual location  but it's really good to know that I can get my Zorba's fix in the comfort of my own home.\n",
      "Yes  yes  yes!! So happy there is an authentic Greek restaurant in our new neighborhood. Looks like it's been here for ages. Best part - it's BYOB! The food is fantastic  we ordered melitzanosalta which is eggplant basically baba ganoush. Along with classic roasted leg lamb and octopus  both dishes were fantastic  very legit traditional. Can't wait to go back again - also very affordable for the portions.\n",

      "Can you say overwhelmed?!   As a coffee fan I was a bit in awe of the size of this place.   It's a coffee shop but  on steroids.   From artisan buns and rolls to coffees and lattes  LA Colombe has a little something for everyone.   My only suggestion would be for anyone on their first visit  you should stroll up to the counter and take a menu prior to getting in line.  It explains their sizing and flavors so that you aren't looking stuck when it's time to order.   Drink up!\n",
      "I love the coffee here  but the food is also amazing. I never had anything that I did not like. The sandwiches are amazing- loved the grits with bacon and eggs. And while you're here  pick up a loaf of freshly baked baguette. It does get pretty crowded on weekend mornings  but by about 1 pm Saturday  you're golden.\n",
      "Been making Lacolombe at home for about a year and finally took a ride to the Fishtown Cafe. So glad i did. Food was great and coffee was even better. Had a hand pour Yemen and it was perfect  highly recommended. Wife had a cappuccino with a perfect heart of cream on top. Worth the 45 minute ride from NJ!!!\n",
      "Pros:  Their savory menu is delicious.  The corsica coffee roast is by far my favorite.    Mediocre:    Their baked goods are OK.  Sometimes if you don't stand at the counter they forget about your drink order.  However  they are quick to offer a pastry at no charge.    Con:     No internet.  Overpriced.\n",
      "My friend and I ordered drinks and they said they would call our name. After 15 minutes  we walk up to the counter to ask for our drinks and the barista said they've been sitting here for a while.....they literally did not call our name or made no effort to look for us (the place is huge). Drinks were not anything special and over priced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Located on a shady street off girard. There isn't much else in the block around this bar but it's still a great spot. They have old school arcade machines all over the place  great beer  and great snacks. The beef jerky is homemade  the grilled cheese and tomato soup is creamy  gooey  and delicious. The beer list is great. I'm not much of a craft beer drinker but my hubby and everyone else I know loves this bar for its beer list.\n",
      "All right  I have a few bones to pick with you people  but first I'm going to tell you that Barcade is a fantastic concept and I LOVE that they brought this to Philadelphia. It's a great addition to the growing Fishtown neighborhood. For those of us in our late-twenties and thirties  this place should be our mecca. Beer that doesn't taste like piss  video games from our childhood and a decent bite to eat  if you choose. Failing to see what the problem is here. This place is wonderful and I plan on making weekly trips here.   So here are my bones to pick...  1.) The beer... YOU'RE PAYING FOR QUALITY  NOT QUANTITY. Microbrews are also just that... MICRO. This beer is not mass-produced in multiple factories  it is hand-crafted by people who genuinely love beer. It takes time  effort  a lot of good equipment. You're goddamn right I'm going to pay $6 for a good beer. You can go right ahead and go down the street to pay $6 for piss water  if you'd like. That means more rare beer for me and less for your dumb ass.   2. Cut them some slack on their food. They're only been open a couple weeks! They need to figure out what is best and what YOU want. Give em some times  guys. They smoke their own meat! Just give em some credit and time. Damn.  3. The machines are 20-30+ years old  of course they're going to have kinks. Go find a 30 year old TV and tell me how the picture is on it. Then try to find a repairman to fix it in a timely manner (ie: 3 minutes by your impatient standards.) If a machine eats your money  they will gladly refund your quarters at the bar (but don't be a lying slug about it to get shit for free.)  Also... This is the SAME company that owns Barcade in Brooklyn and Jersey City. Is Jersey City also trying to 'become' like Brooklyn/Williamsburg too? NO. The owners trying to bring some good beer and video games into Philly. So shut up about us Philadelphians trying to be wannabes and go the fuck back to your overpriced Brooklyn 'art studio'. We don't need you bitching about everything too.\n",

      "This place frustrated me! Last night we hosted some friends and wanted to check this place out  big mistake. I guess going on a Saturday night wasn't the best idea. Anyway we got there around 730-800pm. It was a madhouse! I expected this place to be much larger. After some searching we finally found a small table in the front of the joint  enough room for the ladies to sit. Went and ordered 4 beers  $26.00  yes for 4 drafts. I know some will read and say must be good beer  it is  Neshaminy creek. Keep in my every other place has it for much less. Seems a bit much to me but it was overlooked as the atmosphere is pretty cool.  We attempted to play some games  lucky enough to play maybe 2? In the hour we were there. It's just too small and too crowded. No games  very tight  games are so close together so you're bumping people playing their games. No place to put your beer. I don't know  I wanted to love this place  unfortunately we all left disappointed. The idea is cool but the execution is a failure..We will not be returning....\n",
      "Good selection of beers  old arcade games  and the sandwiches were decent.  The prices were reasonable and  parking was plentiful.  A good way to use up those quarters!\n",
      "I won't be back. The concept is great! The games are only 25 cents. The drink & beer selection is awesome! But....the staff (at least who I delt with) is rude.  I went there Sunday night for my friends birthday. The bartender - named Neira according to my receipt - was the MOST miserable person I have ever met. She was rude & just very unfriendly. It kind of ruined the vibe of the entire night. At first I thought maybe she was just having a bad night  but after reading through all the reviews before mine  this seems to be a common occurance.  There are much nicer  friendlier places I'd be happy to spend my money at. But hey  if you really want to play some onld school aracde games  you may like it.\n",
      "The bar has old arcade games  cant beat that.  It was a bit pricey  but they do offer a ton of craft beers.  Considering the type of beers  its comparable.  It was a Friday night when I was there.  It wasn't too crowded until about the peak hours of 10-12.  Crowd or not  I will return.\n",
      "This is a food only review ( i already love the games and beer list). I've been there a couple times already and LOVE it. I don't get the negative remarks they get foodwise  the sandwiches and food are AMAZING. I have yet to order bad food from this place. So far I've had (or tasted) the pulled pork sandwich (which is my favorite) the duck sandwich  roast beef sandwich  grilled cheese with bacon  and the sirichia deviled eggs. All sandwiches come on hearty  artisan style breads with amazing toppings and great dipping sauces. Their barley mustard is to die for. Sandwiches also come with these great artisan style hard pretzels and one of the best homemade pickles i've ever had.  If you manage to get in there on a Friday or Sunday afternoon  grab the lunch special. It's a sandwich  chips and a beer for $10. You can't beat it with a stick.   Foodwise (or management wise) the place is losing a half a star for not having the lunch special on Saturdays (which makes no sense at all) and a half a star for having some of the douchiest bartenders in the history of man. I don't know if they're actually Brooklyn hipsters  but they act/look like the part. The female staff members are great and helpful  the male ones..not so much.\n",
      "This place is pretty cool. Very darkly lit  exposed brick walls. Very nice atmosphere.   The beer list is top notch. A little expensive  but still awesome beers on tap.  .....Ok  I can't go on with this review anymore. I'm really upset. Do you know why? I met someone at The Barcade last night. Our encounter only lasted 5 minutes  but I fell in love. Her name was Mac & Cheese Pulled Pork Sandwich w/ Arugula & Pepper Jack. We had the best time ever. But  as quickly as we met  she departed. Her taste lingered in my mouth for hours. I walked home  kicking rocks thinking about her. She was the best I ever met. I hope to run into her again someday.  She was cheap too  -)\n",
      "Environment: Breaks my heart but this place can get out-of-control. Been here a few times and it's definitely not a place that sticks out to me as much. The games are classic. Everything from Pac-man to Teenage-Mutant Ninja Turtles (multi-player) is always a win for me. Tokens are really cheap  too. Despite the reminiscent vibes of being on these arcade games  there was a fight that broke out and unfortunately it got to the point it just wasn't okay. No one diffused it  staff was completely oblivious  wish it could've been a more enjoyable experience. Although  you can never complain when you watch someone get sucker-punched 2 feet from your own face...  Drinks: Most drinks on draft are $5-7  wish they had a better selection of IPAs but I won't hold that against them.\n",
      "I have been to a number of dog friendly hotels...just not in the city and did not know what to expect. Usually they are motel like.  This one was in the heart of the city.  I walked tentatively into the hotel lobby as i have a labrador/golden mix who is not easy to hide.  We got to the front desk to register and i was still feeling uneasy although my  bf had assured me it was a dog friendly hotel. Reception was so nice immediately putting us at ease. As we checked in an attendant asked if Bentley could have treats which she fullly enjoyed. The Reception person also asked if we would like a welcome kit for Bentley. Holy moly. Of course. Dog dishes  a mat  treats  etc. I was blown away.    Plus the guests at the hotel all stopped to compliment and pet \\queen Bentley\\\". Our room was on the top floor. Awesome!  Even when i went to walk her the car attendants greeted her by name. We were so impressed with the service we decided to come back an extra night.   Thank you Loews. I didnt realize a hotel could be so dog friendly especially to a big dog.\"\n",

      "Stayed one night.  Room was clean and comfortable.  Employees were consistently the best!  Valet  front desk  servers  room service  all were courteous and eager to please.  Good place to stay  would return.\n",
      "Absolutely fabulous stay at the Loews hotel Philadelphia! The service was fantastic! Room was clean  had a great view. It was my boyfriend and i's anniversary and the hotel gave us champagne and chocolate covered strawberries at no extra charge!  My boyfriend spoke with concierge Kimmy and she made everything so special! They even put rose petals on our bed while we were out at dinner! Would definitely recommend to a friend and we will definitely be coming back to stay again!\n",
      "Summary: great location  great service  incredibly comfortable clean rooms. First rate. We stayed here for two nights when we were in town to work the election. Got a good deal through TripAdvisor using Booking.com . When we arrived  we were told that the hotel upgraded our room. Turns out to be a large room with huge king bed on the 18th floor with a corner view. Spectacular! Everything was clean  modern and lovely  and the sheets and comforters and pillows were incredibly comfortable. Room was very quiet we heard only the slightest noise from the binging of the elevator and the slamming of doors by our neighbors. Parking was easy  if a bit pricey  but worth the convenience. Great service on check-in from valet parking to assistance with luggage to checkin to assistance with luggage to our room. Concierge was extremely helpful arranging for a dinner reservation at short notice.  We did not use the bar which looked great  particularly if you are a Bourbon lover.  Lobby area is stunning  with renovated marble and a safe from its former incarnation as a bank.  Perfect location  a block from Reading Terminal Market and access to all the attractions of center city Philadelphia.\n",
      "Stayed here two nights for a conference. The rooms were very clean  comfortable  and fairly modern looking. Convenient location  definitely safe. All staff was very friendly. Lobby is busy  but nice place to sit\n",
      "\n",
      "The rooms are very updated with a great tv  work area and furniture.  The set up of the tv in relation to the bed was weird but I guess they couldn't put the TV in front of the windows. I was also excited how close Chinatown was located.\n",
      "Having an awesome stay. Had to be somewhere very early so I parked in the valet and brought my bags into the lobby hoping they could hold them for me until check in. Turns out  they had a room available  and I was able to get right in around 6am. Truly grateful as I woke up at 4:00 this morning so getting a 30 minute power nap on the comfy hotel bed before heading out was a real treat. The room is nice. I like the layout. Very open with lots of windows. Magnificent views of the city and you don't hear traffic at all from the upper levels. I ordered room service and the food was great. Later  I accidentally locked myself out of my room and security helped me get back in. They checked my ID to make sure it was actually my room  which is good practice. I was apologetic but the security guy was so nice. Everyone I've interacted with today has been a joy. I wish I remembered the valet's name this morning. He was wonderful. This is my first time at the Loews and I'll definitely be back! The staff is incredibly kind and accommodating. My room is clean  my bed is comfy  and I'm happy. Thanks Loews!\n",
      "GREAT place to stay! My husband and I spent our anniversary night here and the front desk (Jake) sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne and anniversary card. We stopped at the bar on our way out to dinner and the bartender gave us 2 drinks on the house as well. Great service didn't end at checkout... 2 weeks later my husband realized he left his eyeglasses at the hotel....we called and were transferred to Craig in Loss prevention who said that a pair of eyeglasses were reported found and that they would mail them out to us immediately free of charge. This by far is the best service we've experienced from our travels in the Northeast!! Clean  modern  and excellent service.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food here for a takeout lunch was on time  fresh & seriously delicious. Flounder mustard greens soup plus the leek pancake: order the soup and prepare yourself for a clean  bright set of traditional flavors led by fresh ginger  scallions plus tender filets so fresh they were almost sweet. A cut waaay above average. It's pan-Asian that respects its roots\n",
      "I normally get the Garlic Sauce entree. I love it at level 2 heat with chicken. My last time there (three days ago)  I ordered the House Special Noodles with chicken. It was simply ok. Nothing special. Way too many noodles with not enough protein or veggies. I added chilli oil to give it some kick and it tasted better  but still not as flavorful as I prefer.   Service was good and professional  as usual.\n",
      "My first try at Schezuan food and I am a fan already. I tried the popcorn shrimp and the picked chilli fish. The popcorn shrimp is crunchy spicy just perfect. the portions of the entrees as I judged from the pickled chilli fish is good enough for 2 people.  The place is pretty neat too.. It is while and red and I liked it =)\n",
      "Jane G is currently my most frequented restaurant. My favorite dish is the Fire Pot with Flounder served heated with a sterno. At a level 3 it's covered in dried chilies and has whole peppercorns  chunks of garlic and ginger and more chilis floating on top of enokitaki mushrooms  tofu and cabbage...and more chilies. I also love the Boiled Hot Sauce with fish  the Kung Pao chicken  and of course  the Dan Dan noodles. I wish they would bring back the rabbit with peanuts appetizer. Jane G will you please put it back on the menu?\n",
      "AMAZING! Being a huge fan of Asian cuisine I know what is good and bad Asian food  this is most certainly good. Starting off the mean with mouth watering scallion pancakes I knew this would be a memorable meal. I followed this amazing appetizer with the mango style Sichuan meal with chicken  I was amazed by the flavor and texture of both the mango and chicken. It is incomparable. If you're in the area and stop by  you're in for a treat\n",
      "Absolutely loved Jane G's. Everything we ordered (brussel sprouts  cucumbers  Dan Dan noodles  cabbage and peppers and long hots and chicken) were incredible!! I wish we has gone with a group so we could have tried more. Food was fresh  staff attentive and atmosphere inviting. Definitely going back soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went to Jane G's yesterday. I ordered fish dry pot lunch special. It tastes very fresh and good. It comes with a soup  and a rice. The environment is very nice. Very clean and kind of fancy. The people work there are very helpful. I love that place. I will definitely try Dan Dan noodles next time. It looks so good.\n",
      "Food is awesome!  I just moved two blocks away and this is my new to go Chinese restaurant.  Its not typical take out  its fancy.  The dumplings are my favorite.  Its decorated real pretty and they usually have live music for happy hour on weekends.\n",
      "Los Gallos is one of my mainstays. It's consistently good  wether I eat in or take out and I frequently do both. In house the service is friendly and quick and the restaurant itself is clean and spacious. As for delivery  they're always faster than I expect. The food is fantastic  I have to stop myself from finishing every single chip and scoop of guac. Tacos and burritos are great and the mole is one of the best I've had.   I thought they might be closed today (it's Labor Day) and when they answered and put me on hold  I definitely high five-d my bf and we did a happy dance  it's that good.\n",
      "Pretty good Mexican food. Nice chille rellenos  great shrimp tacos. The guacamole is not fresh and neither is their salsa. Service is ok  not rude  but not friendly. All in all I expected better based on reviews  but I cannot give 5 stars to guacamole not made to order and from a jar.\n",
      "Tacos were amazing!!! Our group shared el pastor  pollos rancheros  carnitas  and saudero. Each plate comes with three loaded tacos. The pineapple on el pastor was the perfect touch of freshness. We also had guacamole  which was so fresh  and tortilla soup. We were so happy with everything served.  The environment was also fun  with bright colors and decor  and very friendly service.  We would definitely recommend this spot right in downtown Philly. BEWARE of the parking situation...it may take a few minutes and a few times around the block.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to visit the restaurant because of the raving reviews. Well I would say that my food was not good at all. The beans were not seasoned  the sauce the enchiladas came in were salty and had a bitter taste. I actually decided to send my food back to the kitchen. The waitress wasn't pleasant but I wasn't surprised because they are working her hard -she's literally doing everything. I wouldn't recommend this place but my friend enjoyed his burrito. I tried his burrito also and didn't care for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Los Gallos is definitely off the beaten path  but it is a must. I asked a few Mexican friends where they go and Los Gallos was a consistent answer.  Since Los Gallos is BYOB  my girlfriend and I now go on weekends. It is a great substitue for Cantina. It is cheaper  better  and you never have to wait. The only thing Cantina has over Los Gallos is outdoor seating.  Contradictory to Yelp information  they do accept credits cards!\n",
      "Everyone in here is so nice. They make you feel welcomed as soon as you open their ridiculously heavy door.   When someone asks me where's a good place to eat  there's two places I think of. This is one of them. This is where you can get cheap  delicious food that tastes like your mom made. It's that good.  I'm not sure what part of Mexico they are from but they're a legit Mexican place. None of that Americanized Tex-Mex crap.    If you enjoy good food  give this place a try.\n",
      "Eaten here a few times before and it has been decent. Today i ordered pickup for two burritos: 1 chicken burrito no dairy  1 veggie burrito no dairy. I know english isn't  the first language of the lady on the phone  so i tried to be really clear. failed anyways.   Got to the restaurant  and I am told that the chicken burrito has dairy and veggie burrito has no dairy. They were kind of unpleasant about the entire thing. Apparently she said \\Chicken ALL\\\" which is suppose to mean that the chicken burrito will contain all of the listed ingredients. This is unfamiliar terminology to me  but if you're ordering make sure to listen closely.   Anyways  just decided to pay for the veggie burrito and go. Before leaving I asked about 3 times whether the veggie one had cheese. and she looks at me as if i am really stupid before answering \\\"no\\\" for the 3rd time.   Got to the car  found out the burrito had cheese. Went back to the restaurant  she blamed the cooks and while i was expecting the worst  she did refund me.   Bottom line: Good food. Learn Spanish.\"\n",
      "Amazing food and very pleasant service started with the the free chips and two sauces. Be careful. I filled my stomach with them  they were so tasty. Then mistake #2  we ordered guacamole and chips. So tasty   What ever space was filled with that. Then got the white rice drink with cinnamon. Tasty as hell.  Then the wife for the chorizo taco. Tasty    I got the #89. Pollo o Bistec con Dos Huevos.  Chicken with two sunny side up eggs.  Needed a wheel chair to carry me out. I ate like a pig.\n",
      "Buon Burger  abbiamo provato il cheesburger ed il veggie  entrambi buoni! Rimane sempre un fast food  ma ambiente carino  alla moda  personale gentile  al di sopra sicuramente della media. Si cena tranquillamente con 15$ a testa senza risparmiarsi alcuna delizia!\n",
      "This is another in the increasingly common number of gourmet burger places  with this one trying to be more hip trendy than others...and pretty much succeeding  at least in comparison to the others that 've seen.  The interior is bright and clean with light-wood paneling on the walls  high ceilings  and large windows at the front.  The décor has basically an industrial-rustic look  including several large communal tables made of highly polished thick slabs of wood that -- along with the wood paneling on the walls -- are countered with industrial steel fixtures.  There's plenty of seating at tables of different sizes and heights.  One side of the restaurant also has a large bar.  The custard milkshakes are very good -- thick and rich with flavor. The hot dogs are very good as well.  My one food 'complaint' is that the sauerkraut on the hot dogs was a bit odd to me -- it was much brighter (in color and flavor) and more crisp than I'm used to...and I whiningly had a taste for good old  regular sauerkraut that's more boiled and more sour than what I received here.\n",
      "This is a good burger! Definitely recommend getting a double though  spoke with a guy who was quite disappointed with his single  too small a patty! Oh well  flavors  texture  looks  smells  all there like a good burger to me! Tried my buddy's onion rings! Killer! That's where it's at a must!\n",
      "We stopped by at 11pm on a Friday night and ordered the cry and fry and a custard. Once we had paid  we were told they were out of onion rings and asked if we just wanted fries. After saying yes  we weren't offered a refund for the $3 price difference. Then one of the employees complained about how crowded it was and how they just wanted to shut the lights off and tell everyone it was closed.  When we went back the next day at 6pm for dinner  the front door was locked and one of the employees gleefully turned off the lights. It was supremely disappointing.\n",
      "Great burger  chili cheese onion rings and need velvet concrete.  Would definately go back. Good service. Would like to have a larger water cup but enjoyed the entire experience.\n",
      "For months I had been tracking Burger Fi like an Iroquois brave. I'd put my proverbial ear to the ground (aka read about it in The Insider / Foobooz) and my excitement would grow as signs of it's opening neared. Each day I would walk by on my way to work and glance in  and it seemed to be getting closer and closer but not opening  finally I couldn't take it and I shot them an email saying what's the deal  stop this nonsense and open already!! They told me to chill and it would be about a week.   Fast forward a few weeks and the day finally came for boo and I to spend our epic Sunday cheat meal at BF. We walked in and the place was jumping. NFL combine coverage on all the TVs  I felt like I could potentially be spending a fair amount of NFL Sundays here. There was not much of a line and boo and I each ordered the Brisket Burger bc why wouldn't you. 2 patties of ground brisket with Swiss and blue cheese? C'mon son. Then because I'm fat I got an order of parm fries and a Chicago style hot dog. Boo got a side of onion rings. Total cost plus a soda almost $40.00 a little on the high side for casual but whatev  if it lives up to its billing I'd gladly pay it every freakin' Sunday.  After paying you shuffle down the line and wait for your buzzer to go off to get your food. I stood patiently in the corner while boo secured a seat. at the 15 minute mark the guy next to me became agitated and I was thinking it's only going to get worse from here. At 20 mins he went up and asked about it and the manager checked on it and told him it was up next. This whole time I would look back at boo and she would shoot me these dart looks like \\say something! say something!\\\" I would look at her like \\\"I ain't got the energy girl\\\". Our food came at the 30 minute mark. Famished I handed in my buzzer and took the food to the table.   As crazy as this sounds both our burgers were really bland. Thinking back I can't remember if they put the blue cheese on or not bc its illegal for blue cheese to be bland. We ended up drowning them in ketchup. Very disappointing. The sides we got we fine but the star here is the burgers and it just wasn't up to snuff. Feeling dejected we walked out with our heads low. A week later I was walking by around 7:00 there were about 10 people in there so I decided I ain't going out like that  this place has to be good and we just came on the wrong day. I got the standard Burger Fi burger green style. It still took about 15 minutes to get. The lettuce wrap was awesome however the burger didn't taste like anything. Another ketchup drowning and I left again dejected.   I still am holding out hope that these are the early restaurant blues but I cherish my Sunday cheat meals and I can't take the gamble on Burger Fi again. Maybe a Tuesday lunch but not my Sunday.\"\n",
      "Only giving this spot 3 out of 5 reasoning the burger meat was excellent. Very fresh  very clean tasting   I didn't like that the burgers pretty pricey I mean I got the twenty eight I think that's what it's called...my daughter a beef hot dog and my friend got a veggie burger and a drink 4 for items 28 dollars sooooo.....  I wasn't to mad about spending almost 30 dollars for a burger  veggie burger  hotdog  and small drink....thinking everything came with fries I was excited to try this spot (always seen it going to the reading terminal)...  Food comes out...no fries with the order that a be a extra 5 to 8 dollars....and the burger was TINY For 11 bucks at a fast food joint I want that Jawn to fill me where I can't walk...not the case at all I most likely won't be coming back\n",
      "Modern atmosphere  friendly staff and a good burger! I got the 1/2 and 1/2 with a burger and quinoa patty. Delicious!!!   What sold us on the place was a good selection of beers  6packs to go and bat tender that knows the town and how to show everyone a good time.\n",
      "I ordered on UberEats because I've been wanting to try this place for a while now. I got a customizable cheese burger and added lettuce  pickles  and burgerfi sauce. They sent me that expect with tomato  I honestly hate tomatoes on my burgers so it kind of annoyed me cause when I went to take it off some burgerfi sauce came off with it. Definitely should be more cautious...what if I was deathly allergic. Also had to take the lettuce off after the first bite cause It just wasn't a good piece it looked too dark and just didn't taste right. After I took the tomato and lettuce off the burger it was quite tasty. I really enjoyed the burgerfi sauce and the burger was a really good size. Also got an order of cheese fries and was so disappointed with the cheese it honestly was so bland and just not cheesey enough. The fries itself were also not the bests a lot were burnt. Upside they give u a lot of fries.\n",
      "Best burgers in town! Hot and juicy and crispy french fries. Craft beer  wine and custard. Everything you would want for a casual lunch spot or fun family dinner or just a good place to grab a few brews and watch the game!\n",
      "This is the best place I've been to in a longggg time!! A grownup spot with no distractions...just focus on your dinner companion. The music is incredible with Live music and since I live down  I'll be back over and over...I'm in love\n",

      "Came here for restaurant week. It was extremely crowded on the day that we went because there was a jazz performance. We knew about the performance ahead of time and how popular it was so we were not bombarded or uncomfortable  we expected it. The ambiance  the decor the atmosphere... it's all perfect. if I could frequent this place without having to eat or drink  I would just to enjoy the atmosphere. Our server was polite  knowledgeable and attentive. Our appetizers  entrees and desserts were phenomenal.   Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I think South has the potential to be much better than what it is now. The atmosphere is inviting  live music is always a plus  but the food and service fall flat.  Our waitress was very inexperienced  describing menu items vaguely and haphazardly \\ we focus on fresh and healthy food- like we have organic chicken and things like that\\\". When she finally brought our bread  she described it as \\\"like Gouda biscuits\\\".   My boyfriends gumbo was so bland and tasteless he had to ask for hotsauce to give it some flavor  and that didn't even begin to give it the depth and complexity of flavor that a good gumbo is known for.  My steak which I ordered medium rare was more medium  very thin  and seemed like it was from the local supermarket.  My biggest criticism was that the 2 heavily bearded cooks who were wearily working the open kitchen  weren't using any coverings for their big beards. Gross!!!  The only item we ordered worth eating was the berry and peach cobbler topped with ice cream.  Do yourself a favor and buy a good steak  fresh veggies  and a bottle of wine and make yourself a better meal at home- without the beards and valley girl service.\"\n",
      "Had high hopes and was not disappointed. Food and drinks were very good  especially liked the grits  cornbread  and fried green tomatoes. You can't visit this restaurant and not get the cornbread  it comes warm out of oven in a small cast iron skillet with butter on top. I ended up ordering the seafood gumbo after much debate  not too spicy and overall good but I discovered I'm just personally not a huge fan of gumbo. Can't forget to mention the great service too  very accommodating and pleasant.\n",
      "South Restaurant  Biscuits- same texture as red Lobster  Appetizer Crab toast!! Awesome Entree Short ribs with cream collard greens yummy  carrots and grits ( I don't eat grits but everyone else said they were good) Dessert- warm peach and blackberry cobbker w/vanilla ice cream (so good. I don't usually eat dessert).  My drink- cucumber strawberry lemonade - yummy not to strong   Shawn had duck gumbo  salmon w/ cream corn and rice and same dessert. My my friends had the pecan pie w/ice cream.  Cons The drinks were really expensive. And they charged a drink tax. So our bill was really high.   However I would eat hear again. The décor is beautiful. Bathrooms very nice and clean. Service top notch. (Especially Lydia)We didn't hear the band. Our reservations were way before the band was due to play.\n",
      "I saw this place on line and when I visited my daughter in Philly  I couldn't wait to visit. So we went to see Cindy Bradley  a trumpeter( who is also a teacher). She was so entertaining with her various stories. But her playing transported me to the Bay Area of Cali. In the house band was no other than Gerald Veasley. The food was really tasty. I had the special of Mahi Mahi over yellow rice  with a mango and I believe corn sauce. I ate every last bit. These are the same people who own Relish  so it makes sense the food was delicious. My daughter had catfish   which she loved. The drinks were good but my cosmo tasted like it had no liquor. My daughter loved her strawberry cucumber drink. And I have to mention  we had one fine brother as a waiter. I can't remember his name but his hair was pulled back in a ponytail. Very attentive! We will return!\n",
      "Enjoying the south cuisine with the exuberant sounds of Jazz  a perfect start to a weekend.\n",
      "I literally spent $40 on 3 breakfast sandwiches  a small coffee  and a small orange juice. All 3 of the sandwiches were supposed to be the same  and they instead gave me sausage and eggs. I'm not usually one to complain  but this price is unacceptable for the wrong food.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food is OK  and the decor is somewhat trendy.  But the prices are out of this world.  And on top of that  they don't have prices on anything  so you just pay up because really  who cancels orders after they've been given?  Downstairs seating is ridiculous as people are always falling over you.  But if you want to look really trendy  this is where you should sit I guess.  There are better places for coffee and a breakfast in the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love their coffee  pastries  and they're super friendly.   All around  the perfect neighborhood coffee shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "One shot is a good summer coffee spot because there iced coffee and iced mocha are really good.  Their hot espresso drinks  however  are not.  I ordered one once and haven't since.  More recently  I tried a friend's  it reminded me to stick to my guns.  I haven't had their regular hot coffee  but one of these days I'll give it a try.  What I am totally obsessed with is Will's Bagel.  Honey  cream cheese  and almonds.  Get it on a cinnamon raisin bagel.  So good!  I make these at home now on weekdays  but they're much better here.\n",
      "Sigh.. Here's another disappointing cafe experience in Philly.  My boyfriend and I were excited to come here after reading so many positive Yelp reviews  only to discover that the food was below mediocre. Maybe they were just having a bad day  who knows.  We ordered a simple mocha latte  the ultimate breakfast sandwich on a bagel  and a regular plate of breakfast food items (forgot the menu name).   First  the ultimate breakfast sandwich: besides the bagel tasting like rubber  the sandwich overall was overwhelmingly greasy. I recall the grease literally dripping down and forming a puddle on the plate while my boyfriend was struggling to eat it. He said it was almost nauseating to eat. I tried it too  and noticed that the fried ingredients in the sandwich  most noticeably the hash browns  were fried in OLD oil. Man  that scent was bad.   Same applied for the second item  the regular breakfast plate  the main part was a biscuit sandwich with eggs and bacon. The biscuit was  wait for it.. OVERWHELMINGLY MILKY and buttery  which was also nauseating to me  and of course  the hash browns.. No need to repeat myself. The few bites of side salad were good though  but you can't really go wrong with veggies.   The bad experience with the food basically ruined the mocha latte. I can't even remember if it tasted decent or not.  I really wanted to like this place  but they need to tone it down with the grease and butter. :-(   Also  before I forget  everything we ordered came out to be around $30. Is it worth..?\n",
      "This place hits the spot.  I didn't try the coffee  but went with tea instead  so I can't comment on the coffee's goodness today.  What I can say is they place great tunes  there is plenty of space  the wifi doesn't poop out  and the decor & vibe of the place is perfect for me (kinda country  chill).  The egg sammy I ordered is delish  hot and cheesy.  I'm working here very productively  with a view of the horse stable out the window.  So I'll definitely be back here to work and chow down again.\n",
      "I've never eaten here  so I can't speak for the food. But the coffee is delicious  the staff is always cheerful and very helpful and eager to recommend their favorites. Very nice ambiance for sitting and relaxing with a cup of coffee and a book -- nice cozy atmosphere for a city coffee shop.\n",
      "Visited here last Sunday & really enjoyed the food  and live music!  The service was a little slow but the music def kept you distracted!  I ordered the chicken livers & gravy & a salad very yummy! (Asked for extra gravy)\n",
      "OMG.  We went last night for the all you can eat Crabs  and they were absolutely awful.  In fact  all of the food was vile.  The crabs were so small and all of the meat stuck to the shell.  So NOT worth the money.  I could have made my own crab legs for half the price and they would have actually tasted good.  AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL\n",
      "Ok Comedy on Monday Nights was soooo good. I had the appetizer sampler I posted a picture  more than enough food to share. We had no idea it was that big but it was delicious  especially the cat fish and corn bread. But get there early or make reservations for the shows because it gets packed and you end up paying to stand and watch a show. Great for the nice summer nights  and contrary to other peoples opinion  I like the new locations  more parking right by the movie theater  so you can get drinks before or after watching a movie and its right off the highway. I frequented this venue over the summer and have no complaints.\n",

      "Warmdaddy's is the number one soulfood restaurant in Philly.  A bit pricey  but the service is always excellent and the food is amazing.  I make it a point to come here at least a few times a year.  The portions are very generous and the live music makes it a memorable dining experience.  Parking is ample as well.  There's also the option of having meals outdoors  either the patio or the rooftop (beautiful view of Philly) - no cover charge for outdoor dining.\n",
      "The food is good.  But don't expect good service.  My husband and I went there for a Friday night dinner. We were seated outside due to the wait time. This suited us just fine since the music was too loud and over powering for me.  Once seated however the wait staff forgot about us.  I had to go and find our waitress just so she could come get our drink orders. At this point we knew what we wanted. Our order took so long that our appetizers and meals came out at the same time. Some sides never made it out. The wait for the check and even to pay was even more painful.   I might order take out but never dine in again.\n",
      "If for nothing else... I give them a five for the cornbread. I consider Warm Daddy's to be a Philadelphia treasure! Local talents are amazing  the cost atmosphere makes it feel like a speak easy or smoky jazz club. It's nice to feel like a part of a community.\n",
      "Awesome southern comfort food in the heart of Old City. The management here is great and they make you feel welcome. They have live blues music on the weekend and that helps make the atmosphere really chill. The food was excellent: chicken and waffles  gumbo  fried catfish  mashed potatoes  collard greens and candied yams. They also serve some strong mixed drinks  which are very  very good. The service was very attentive and accomodating  I highly recommend it for a fun night out.\n",

      "This place is ideal if you want to stop in for quick drink and appetizer and watch sports. Inside there's a main dining room area and 2 bars on opposite ends. This place also has a very decent beer menu  as well and cocktails and wine. I recommend the wings  as the seasoning is sweet and has a kick to them!\n",
      "Nice beer selection  outdoor dog friendly seating and good food. The inside restaurant is beautiful and it seems like a great place to watch sports (large projector screen with TV above the bar).\n",
      "I love love love the original location  so I was absolutely thrilled to hear City Tap would be coming to logan square (much easier to get to from the train!). They have good beer  good food  and an overall great atmosphere. While I am sad that this location doesn't have fire pits like the original  I hope to frequent this location in the future for happy hours and nights out.\n",
      "I went here late one night months ago with friends and have been meaning to write a positive review since! After putting it off  I'm finally making sure to do it. That's how much I liked this place. We arrived to a very warm welcome from the bartenders as if they new us as a regular customers forever and got some free welcome shots from a very friendly bartender who's name I can't remember. The staff was attentive and a lot of fun. Would definitely recommend you go here if you're in the area!\n",
      "\n",
      "This was my first time here since this became tap house and I must say I like it. I've been to the one in university city a couple times and while I do like this location I prefer the logan square one since it's in a ideal location which is near center city.   This place is very ideal for fans as there are TVs located pretty much everywhere one looks  including one huge flat screen which is mounted above the bar. The food is what one will typically Find in a bar ie wings and nachos. The main highlight on the food part was the pulled pork nachos as it had this nice cheese sauce that went well with every bite of the nacho.   All in all  it depends on what you are coming in for. If you are coming in for watching sports  having some good beer and decent food then this is the place for you. The atmosphere is inviting and the wait staff are friendly\n",
      "Delicious. So happy I Yelped for a restaurant closer to home and stumbled upon this. It's small and pleasant inside with some decent hip hop setting the mood. The menu is small  but packed a punch. We ordered the Duck Fries  which were heaven. Fries smothered in smoked gouda   shredded duck  and scallions. For 8 bucks came a pretty large bowl that I couldn't stop picking at. I ordered one of the specials  the scallop and foie gras  tacos...wow...so good (then I read the origin of foie gras and hated myself  but aside that...). The person I was with ordered the pork roll burger  which I tried of course. It was incredibly juicy and cooked perfect. I will definitely come back here. Definitely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where do I start. I ordered food to go it was my first time here so I ordered the Blue Jawn  burger no lie  I vomited we had to hurry up and pull over. I ordered the general tso chicken tacos not good and the sauce was too sweet. They were using bare hands to prepare the food which was already a turn off. The place is small and tight everything is everywhere. My 3 year old daughter brung me spray bottles I guess they had in her sight. The Mac and cheese were like baby elbow and partially hard . Looks are very deceiving  everything looks good but I wasn't happy.My baby didn't even like her Mac and she love Mac and cheese and my son love General tso chicken but not this one. I will not be returning ever. The prices were very high too.The food was being prepared or put together after food was cooked at least when a pizza goes in the oven  and bake it kills the germs.You'll do everything bare hands before cook and after and I have the pic of that too I can post it. No sarcasm needed. Thank you Nick. No everything wasn't as quack up to be\n",
      "If you were able to give it more than 6 stars  I would. The first exposure to the duck I had was at the beer and bacon festival where they had their tomato soup with garlic pulverized bacon. It was so good they ran out about half way through the festival.  Last night was my first time at the actual restaurant. It was a large group so in total I tried the blue duck fries  general tso's wings  the pork roll burger  house blend burger  quack and cheese and classic Mac. If you have a large group make sure they want to share because you're going to want to try everything. It's all amazing and will make you want to come back the next day. Looking forward to trying the brunch menu.  The managers also stopped by our table since it was my friends birthday. They made sure everything was perfect and I was really impressed with the staff.\n",
      "Love this place! I stopped in for brunch on Saturday and had a fantastic experience. Our server  Steph  was phenomenal. She went over specials of the day and ensured that we had a great meal. We started with the Blue Duck fries. They were PHENOMENAL! Definitely get them on every visit. I had the duck benedict and my friend had the chicken and waffles. Both were good. The chicken was nice and crispy but could have used more seasoning. The waffle was fluffy and delicious. The duck breast was tasty and went well with the cherry siracha sauce but I didn't like how the sauce tasted with the rest of the dish. It was taken off of our bill without me asking although they prepared it properly  it simply wasn't to my taste. Overall we had a great experience here. I def recommend it.  (Oh and it's BYOB. Wish I had known to bring a bottle)\n",
      "(to the tune of \\The Mack\\\" by Nevada feat Mark Morrison and Fetty Wap)  Yelpers tried to tell me so (yes they did) But I didn't wanna go \\\"Gotta car?\\\" gotta say no. But my mouth wanted to know. Yeah  I felt it from the start. From my tummy to my heart When my sister was in town We were headed to chow down.  No lies to me  (All those reviews weren't kidding) No lies to me Oh my god baby... Take a bite!  Blue Duck  it's like Quack (once again) Blue Duck  it's like Quack (top of the charts) Blue Duck  it's like Quack (gotta go) You know that I'll be back.... Blue Duck  it's like Quack.  Wow. Worth the trip is an understatement. While the schlep was a bit out of my usual trip for eats  my baby sister is all about that burger  and we'd heard only the best. We went later in the day  around 2pm  but service was still incredibly slow (frustrating because there weren't a ton of folks inside  but maybe they were recovering?) This resulted in us getting our duck fat cheese fries WAY before our burgers. We TRIED  to wait for the burgers  but our stomachs rumbling drowned out that idea. The mac and cheese  the cheese fries  the burger.... Every bite was perfect. I only wish that the food came out all at once like we asked. Oh well....  The Beast of Northeast (Philly) [wild boar and beef patty  smoked gouda  sweet tomato jam  crispy sriracha onions  and bacon on brioche] was insane and  IMHO  tastier than her pork roll burger  but that pork roll was sizzled to perfection.   I'll be back for the Quack and Cheese  next time a buddy with a car is feeling adventurous. Hopefully they can speed up the service a bit  don't want all that gouda sauce getting cold!\"\n",
      "Ever since I started working in the area a little over a year ago I dropped in to The Blue Duck for lunch and it quickly became a favorite.   The quack and cheese  duck fries  and anything off the brunch menu on Sunday's are out of this world. Dinner entrees are exceptional all reasonably priced for the quality of food.   I've never had a bad experience here. Great service and great atmosphere.   I try to make it in for one meal a month and if you've got the time you should too.\n",
      "The Blue Duck is located in this very small plaza filled with very bland store signs  but don't let the outside appearance fool you. Inside is very cozy  clean  and nicely decorated.  The staff is always friendly and attentive  and the food is pretttty good. Their duck fries are amazzzzing and the portion is huge! I can never finish an order with my girlfriend and it sucks that it doesn't taste half as good when heated up later. The burger here is really big and unique  but I feel that the meat blend can be a bit better as it seems a bit tough. The brunch menu here is a lot cooler than the normally offered lunch menu (the duck fries are still offered!)  and would much rather come for when they are offering brunch.\n",
      "The food was yummilicious!   The fries could have had alittle more shredded duck   but the overall flavor was spot on.  Duck Fat!  The Tso  wings writer the wasabi blue cheese dipping sauce was wonderful... not too spicy which was  perfect for me.  One complaint... . our waiter was packing our food and instead of using a utensil he used his fingers.... I was not happy about this... and will pack my own food moving forward.  So that means I'm going back!\n",
      "It's nice to have a decent culinary option in NE  but I hear folks talking about this place like it is the second coming of Christ!  The duck fries were some of best fries I've ever had.  Get them  won't disappoint. The duck sandwich and pork roll burger were both bland and barely mediocre. Salads were grossly overdressed.     I'd try it again if I were in the NE.\n",
      "Very good place. It was a bit noisy at first since the tables are right against the bar. The activity at the bar was intense and loud - some had already imbibed quite a bit by the time we arrived for dinner. The food was good  the service good  and over all this was a fun place to dine.\n",
      "Ran into this place on a rainy Philly night and had a nice  cozy meal. The service was very relaxed and friendly. Had a wonderful glass of wine and a few small plates to share. We really liked the food and decor of this place. It was pretty evident though that the charm of this place is the outdoor seating and generally for brunch. Next time.\n",
      "I came here by myself for dinner and sat at the bar. This was a good choice for solo dining  plenty of small tables and bar seats  and lots of options for wines by the glass.  My food--lobster fra diavolo with housemade pasta--was delicious. I probably would have liked it just a touch spicier  but other than that it was pretty perfect  perfect portion size  plenty of lobster  and well-cooked pasta. The wines-by-the-glass list included choices starting at $10  and both of the ones I tried were tasty. The complimentary bread was a bit hard and could have benefited from a toss in the oven  but it was still tasty.  My only complaint about Rouge is how cramped and crowded it is. It was not full to capacity when I went  but it was still uncomfortable sitting at the bar and having people constantly bump me trying to negotiate the small space. If they ever decide to do a big renovation  I bet they could make this place much more ergonomic.\n",
      "I'm in Philadelphia for work and looking for a chill place to grab a drink or two and a bite. Found Rogue and have to say I was very impressed. I sat at the bar and the place was surprisingly busy for a weeknight. Katie behind the bar was the perfect bartender. Nice and attentive without being too familiar and made one of the best cosmos I ever had. I had the tilapia tacos which were the perfect size. Spicy but not hot. Well seasoned and just large enough. Good to split as a starter. I would definitely come back  at a minimum to have another of Katie's killer cosmos.\n",
      "Went here with NYE with a rather large party of 7 (large for the space) and at no fault to Rouge  we weren't seated until 25 minutes after our reservation. The party before us was enjoying their dinner and taking their time. They did offer us a cocktail while we waited  which was lovely.   We ordered the 5 cheese platter which was lovely  great cheeses  although I have no idea what was what!   Next was the seafood apps- calamari  escargot  and mussels. I'm not as adventurous with calamari  but I liked it. The mussels were delicious and bread was plentiful for dipping in the sauce  but I have to say the escargot with goat cheese was hands down the BEST escargot I've ever had. EVER. I told my boyfriend I wanted to come if only for wine and escargot.   Main course was next! There were a good amount of NYE specials  but I opted for the salmon and kale. Kale was perfect  salmon was great. I also got to try one of the NYE specials of scallops and a truffle oil risotto. It. was. epic. I'm a huge fan of truffle oil and wish I could have had more.   Over all  top notch experience and I look forward to going back  and perhaps some alfresco dining in the spring and summer!\n",
      "Excellent service and food was wonderful. We did not have reservations for lunch and when we walked in they assisted us in getting a table by the open window  which was very kind considering it was a perfect day and perhaps would have been filled quickly. I would return in a heartbeat! Highly recommend.\n",
      "I enjoy the ambiance  décor  food  & the cocktails. Rouge is right across the street from Rittenhouse Park. It is a good place to take a date or meet up with friends for some drinks & dinner. You can always sit outside  or by the bar to get a good view.  The dress code for this place is casual but  it's a more sophisticated casual. This isn't your let me throw on jeans & a t-shirt type of place. It's a bit more dressy. I can appreciate that. This place seems to target people in there 30's & 40's but  I also see people in there 20's as well. It is definetly  a more mature environment which is nice.  During my most recent visit  I ordered the cheese plate that came with 5 different types of cheeses. I loved the french bread that came right along side of it. Everything was very fresh & flavorful. Cheese plates are usually a hit or miss for me. I enjoyed mine here. It comes with jam  grapes  & slices of apple. I really like the portion sizes here as well. Not to big but  not to small either.  If you are looking for a posh  upscale yet laid back atmosphere then Rouge  is definetly the place to go.\n",

      "Awesome happy hour and food specials. A bit out of the way for us  but we stop by occasionally because everything is so cheap but high quality during happy hour.\n",
      "Certainly one of the highlights of my time in West Philly was the opening of Local 44. It has served as a great locale to grab a high quality beer from all the US (Great Lakes  Ommegang  Sierra Nevada) and eat some decent pub grub. Its a great place to go on a Saturday night to meet up with friends and start a night there.  We have been coming here after our softball games and have found it to be a great locale to hang out with the team. It doesn't have quite the right seating set-up for out team  but we make it work.\n",
      "My roommate and I were visiting a friend in Philly and super excited that there were vegan options here. We called ahead of time because my roommate has a severe nut allergy that requires 0 cross contamination and complete confidence from the kitchen that her food will be safe. We asked the staff member about this and clearly stated these things and they assured us this would be a safe place for her to eat. When we arrived  our server communicated the exact opposite and said she couldn't make any promises that food would be safe for her. I got up to let her know that we wouldn't be able to stay seated and dine then and instead of listening  she backed up defensively and waved us away. I am incredibly frustrated that we were given inconsistent answers and treated disrespectfully when we tried to explain why we were leaving.\n",
      "Local bar with dedicated staff and affordable prices. Be sure to go during happy hour for the cheaper apps and even cheaper beer. This place has amazing bar food for those of us who are vegetarian vegan. Wildcard: they serve ramen that is off the charts. Make a point to stop by while in W Philly\n",
      "I've loved this bar since it opened  we live a block away and it's always been nice to have a great late night stop nearby.  Last night we stopped by at 11:30pm to grab a quick bite.  I ordered their pumpkin mac & cheese  which I've had before and loved.  When it came  though  it was dry... not more than noodles with chunks of pumpkin.. no cheese in the mac & cheese.  When I pointed that out to our waitress  she first lectured me for using the word \\cheese\\\" since the meal was vegan and the \\\"cheese\\\" is really a non-dairy sauce.  Then she offered to take it back and have the chef \\\"pour some more stuff on it?\\\"  We had ordered other food  so I said no and we ate our other dishes.  When she came back to our table  she asked if she could wrap up the pumpkin mac & cheese.  I said  no  I just wanted it taken off the bill since I didn't eat it.  She dropped the plate back on the table and told me nothing was wrong with the food so there was no way she could take it off the bill & she could either go get sauce or I could take it home.  I was really shocked.  We come to this bar all the time & I've never been treated with such contempt.  The situation escalated  I paid for the whole meal  including the infamous mac & cheese  tipped her well and we left.  But I will never go back.  As much as I like the food  I just don't need to pay to be treated like that. It's too bad that Local just lost a local.\"\n",
      "Everytime i walk in this building i rub the palms of my hands on my jeans and link my teeth together...   The faces on the people frequenting here are mostly recognizable from the neighborhood... unfortunately though i'd rather them be strangers.   Strangers only last as long as you want them to last  neighborhood people...fuck  they last forever.   The beer menu here is suppose to be the beef ' in the stew  but.... its eh'.... it always seems to be eh'.   Most of the weekends here touch on intolerable.   Most of the food here touches hot oil...   The ceiling though is beautiful... under the paint  it is my envy .\n",
      "\n",
      "I would give it 5 stars  but when I was there the bartender (who was very very very nice and attentive) smelled so horribly I could almost not function. I get it  I really do... deodorant is full of chemicals etc. I would URGE him to try the primal pit paste. It is all natural and organic. There is also a crystal salt stick deodorant thing.   The Happy Hour prices were great and we had the brussels sprouts (delicious)  pickled eggs (very good) and beets (love them).\n",
      "Brunch is great. They serve beer-mosas. As in mimosas  but with beer instead of champagne. They honestly get 4 stars just for that.  I've been here otherwise for dinner  drinks... great beer list. It's often crowded  but we didn't have a problem getting a seat for brunch.\n",
      "The best wings ever!!! And delicious dark beer. Walking into this quiet bar  I would have never thought the food and beers would be so high quality. Im generally quite cheap  but had to tip 30%. Loved it\n",
      "My group and I had a great experience here at The Little Lion. We loved the atmosphere and friendly wait staff. Our wonderful waiter made some great beer suggestions. We all enjoyed our entrees  notably the fried chicken and especially my entree  a pan seared salmon over spinach risotto  absolutely amazing. I will definitely be coming back here.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\Location  ambience  service and decor are highlights. Food is average and a little overpriced\\\"  If you want a big group of people to get together at a nicely decorated place  the Little Lion is a great spot! Service is excellent and everyone is friendly. Very well decorated and well kept.  Unfortunately  food is definitely subpar. Almost everything my group ordered was either overlooked (protein) or undercooked (vegetables). Majority of the dishes were bland  as well.  Menu seems to offers a lot of exciting options  but they are not executed in ways you would hope in your head reading the menu.  If you can look over food for a great ambience and seating for groups  this will do!\"\n",
      "I went here for brunch for the first time.  Great place!  The service was prompt  friendly and they didn't make you feel rushed.  We ordered the smoked salmon toast and it was DELICIOUS.  Very citrusy which I liked.  I ordered the crawfish benny and that was done perfectly.  We all enjoyed our meals in a cozy spot in the restaurant.   Here are the only things that were cons... I found it odd that they do not have salt and pepper on their tables.  I know that most white table cloth type of places do that.  But for this casual dining (and especially for brunch)  I found it odd.  Second  although the service was good  the food took a bit longer than normal to get.  Thirdly  I came with a friend that was born and raised in Louisville.  She mentioned that the grits were not very good. Regardless  I would go back.  Their variety of food and drinks are different and delicious!\n",
      "I was wondering when Yelp would let me down. Usually four stars and over 20 ratings makes me happy. This was not the case today. While the establishment is gorgeous and still smells of fresh paint they missed the mark on half of our dishes. Hopefully they are able to recover. The ham and pimento cheese was great. I was excited for the rest of our meal. The ginger snap cocktail was more of a lemon snap. I love ginger beer and the ginger liquor and ginger beer were over powered by lemon. The fried chicken was not properly breaded and bland. It tasted like it was battered in bisquick. The honey was likely to drizzle and I wanted to drown it to make it palatable but there wasn't enough. We were on the way to the airport and I hadn't eaten lunch so we discarded the breading and salvaged what we could and hit the road. The sweet potatoes fries saved that part of the meal. Basically we paid $60 for a few drinks  a ham sandwich  and sweet potato fries.\n",
      "We had an amazing lunch experience here. The Apple Crisp was a great refreshing cocktail for a warm spring afternoon... delightful fruit flavors  yet the rye wasn't hidden. The Peddler Buzz likewise was a nice take on an Irish coffee. We split the Blackened Catfish Po'Boy  which was perfect... baguette just the right texture  sauce super-delicious but not overwhelming  fresh and tender fish. We up-sold to the amazing sweet potato fries. All in all  one helluva lunch in a great atmosphere for a great price.\n",
      "Super yummy oysters  Mac n cheese  Brussels sprouts  tomato soup. Cocktails were ok. Would love to come back for happy hour. Right across street from American revolution museum. Time that visit right & stop in for happy hour.\n",
      "This is my new favorite spot in the city. Besides the fact that I've been waiting forever for someone to occupy the space after Haru closed  The Little Lion brings such a cool vibe to the area and it feels like it belongs. The upstairs is my favorite spot  but with three different dining areas  this place is huge. I have a love/hate relationship with all the small byobs and narrow restaurants in the city... it's so nice to dine in a large open one like this.  The cocktails are fun and tasty and the beer list is creative. I've been here twice and had a tough time deciding what to drink each visit because I wanted them all. The service and food are equally good. The farm cheese is such a yummy appetizer and the apple butter leaf salad was cleaned off my plate in record time. The presentation of the Lion burger was fantastic and it was delicious but next time I need to order an extra side of the sauce because I loved the flavor of whatever they put in it.  My fiancé and I loved the space so much that we have already booked our March 2015 wedding rehearsal dinner in the upstairs room. So excited!!!\n",
      "We went for Philly Restaurant Week and we were first impressed by the amount of food offered for the promotion.  Everything was delicious!  We also ordered the grits  which weren't on the Restaurant Week menu  but were amazing. Our server was very attentive and was very accommodating to my dislike of 1 dish.  It was very easy to switch it out.  I definitely want to visit again.\n",
      "I've had some wonderful meals here and some just ok meals  but Little Lion is an institution in Old City and I hope everyone visits when it comes back - I know I will be there.\n",
      "This place was incredible from top to bottom. Service was spot on and the vibe of the restaurant was like being in a movie. Everyone was laughing and vibrant it was an experience.   We walked in at 5 without a reservation and the place was pretty full but luckily they were able to accommodate us with an out time. Everything we tried was delicious and the plating was amazing. I am dreaming about that tiramisu because it was so unique and delicious.   This is hands down one of the best restaurants I have ever been to in my life from top to bottom.   Cash only but there's an atm in the back.   As most PA restaurants BYOB.\n",
      "Never have my taste buds and palate  something I'm still trying to refine  been treated to such delight.  On top of an exceptional New Year's Eve menu  we were treated to stellar service and a warm  lively atmosphere.  This was one of my best  if not the best  dining experiences I have had in Philadelphia.  Even for our fixed menu  we were allowed to custom order and went with 2 antipasti dishes instead of the pasta.  The eggplant and white bean puree topped with a crustini  pine nuts  and fennel was absolutely outstanding.  This combined with the chicken liver pate was the perfect way for me to start out a meal  sweet and savory.  For entrees  we went with the seafood stew and the Gorgonzola topped filet.  After devouring our surf and turf  I was amazed that my girl had eaten the majority of the filet.  She NEVER eats cheese like Gorgonzola  so you know it must have been prepared perfect.  I'm definitely excited to return and put the regular tasting menu to the test but after eating here and loving the sandwiches at Paesano's  I'm sure it will be another spectacular experience.\n",
      "I love italian food and at this point  can't settle for something that isn't authentic. This place is so unique and extremely delicious with a great deal ($35 person  includes starter  pasta  entree and dessert - I think it's available everyday  we went on a Saturday). The keyword is \\unique\\\"  so take that as you will... Changing classic dishes can deter people  but I welcome it if it is still amazing.  Almost everything on the menu has a special factor to it. Also the portion sizes are small but you will DEFINITELY be full after all four courses. I guarantee it. My girlfriend and I had the scallops and calamari for starters. The scallops were extremely minimal (2? maybe 1 and half? again  size doesn't matter because you have 3 courses to go) but full of so much flavor. I would order this again. The calamari is not like the ordinary fried versions at most places  but grilled - I loved it. It was almost like a salad with the arugula. These were complimented with bread and olive oil & ricotta cheese to dip the bread it... Every italians dream come true.  For pasta  she had the ravioli (I never tend to order these out  but it was full of flavor - again very small portion size) and I had the gnocchi which had much more quantity than the ravioli. I'm used to gnocchi in a blush sauce but the pancetta definitely gave it a very savory taste. It wasn't my favorite gnocchi but still you have to appreciate those flavors and we all should be going out to eat to try new stuff anyway!  I honestly forget what my girlfriend had because my entree was just ... too ... good. Bistecca Siciliana  I will have dreams about you. Again  I don't usually get steak at an italian place but i saw lemon caper butter and fried egg and couldn't resist. It was amazing and I was definitely full at this point. So delicious.  The dessert. I'm not a dessert person - Give me real food and more of it  is what i say. But this chocolate tart (\\\"flourless\\\" as our waiter constantly said. I guess this is an endearing quality when homemade? Maybe it was the wine  but I thought it was funny how he pointed this out many times) was the BEST part. If you like chocolate  you have to order it. No questions. My God  it was the perfect ending to an amazingly unique meal and experience (great wait staff - he was so knowledgeable about everything and polite- and even though small place  great atmosphere).  Did I mention BYOB? So you're paying a little over $35 per person (tax and tip) and that's it for an amazing night of food and memories. 4 stars because sometimes an authentic italian meal with huge portions just can't be beat. But do yourself a favor and go. Now.\"\n",
      "Still one of the best. Table for five right by the window at the front is perfect!.We all had the Turista of course  just ridiculously good for the $35 price. I had the Sformato  Bucatini  and Bistecca and tasted all the non-repeats. Dessert was too much  so we nibbled and took them home. Some on Yelp complain of salt and butter  but uh  this is a treat  not a way of life. Treat yourself. (Also had brunch at Monsu earlier in the day  so maybe I should buy stock!)\n",
      "Had an early dinner here a few days ago. It was the first time in. In all it was a nice dining experience and I'll definitely return to explore the menu further.  We (two) opted for the \\menu turista\\\" tasting which consisted of four small but more than adequate plates. At $33.00 per person  I thought it was a terrific value and offered us the opportunity to sample the menu with some depth. If we had ordered the same 4 courses á la carte (with same-sized portions)  I'd have thought it a bit pricey  but I think they expect most to order the tasting menu.  Our starters were balsamic grilled octopus with oven roasted tomato and house-made sausage with poached egg in a mustard cream. Both were very good  although the octopus arrived to the table room-temperature. For a pasta course we had a spicy lamb ragu maccheroni and lasagne bolognese. Both were very good  but again they needed to arrive piping hot from the kitchen  not barely warm. For entrees  we selected the beef cheek on polenta with salsa passito and the skate in apricot brown butter and lemon. The beef cheek was fantastic. Unfortunately the skate and its sauce were not quite up to par with the rest of the meal. We also ordered a side of  italian spaetzle (according to the menu with fennel  but came with arugula(?) instead). Although we were surprised by its crunchy consistency  the flavor was good. To finish we ordered a lemon crepe and an apple-walnut tart. The tart was superb  but the lemon crepe tasted a bit flat and heavy. In all it was a very good but not great meal.   The service was excellent  but at the time we dined  the restaurant was only a quarter full. The atmosphere is pleasant and the space fairly small. In sum we weren't wowed  but Modo Mio is a very solid 4 stars. CASH ONLY. BYOB. Resv. a must.\"\n",
      "A girlfriend and I had a terrible service experience here last night.  We had a 7 o'clock reservation and had to wait outside  in the cold  until 7:25 when we were finally seated. What's the point of a reservation? The service was so. incredibly. slow. Our waiter was perfectly fine  just seemingly overwhelmed. It took him about 15 minutes from the time we were seated to come around for our orders.  Food came out piece by piece  about 35 minutes between each course  and piping hot like it was just plated seconds ago. The portions aren't large enough to be served that far apart. Bread didn't come out until we asked for it during our second course......... To top it off  within 10 minutes of receiving our check  and 2 minutes of settling our bill  a manager came over and asked us to hurry it along because a large party was waiting on the table.  We still had an entire glass of wine to finish! When I informed him that we waited 30 minutes past our reservation to be seated and would be finishing our wine  he sassed me. We were stunned.   The food:  Antipasti was the rocket salad  which we loved Pasta was the gnocchi and ricotta & spinach stuffed lasagne  both unfortunately over salted  Main was the rib eye  cooked perfectly but with an overdone \\over easy\\\" egg on top  and the porchetta  which was decadent The chef also sent out a side of roasted potatoes and Brussel sprouts for us.  Ambience: it was freezing in there and SO LOUD. I have a sore throat this morning from trying to talk to my friend that was 4 ft across from me.  3/10 would recommend and it is unlikely that I'll ever return.  I'm genuinely surprised people have good experiences here.\"\n",
      "It seemed like over 90% of the reviews gave 5-stars for Modo Mio so I was suuuper excited to try this place. However...one word summarizes my Modo Mio experience: a DISAPPOINTMENT.   The services  atmosphere and the food presentations were Excellent.  On the other hand  SODIUM ruined everything.   For Antipasti  snails and bruschetta (worked very well in terms of flavor and texture)  grilled octopus (i liked  the raisins  almonds and lemon-flavor)  and crab and ricotta cake (which was our favorite). They were all very delicious but SALTY.  For pasta  Lasagne was the best thing. However  shrimp gnocchi had like 4 tiny pieces of shrimp and had not much flavor  along with the specials - lamb gnocchi....which was VERYx10 salty (there was no balance amongst the ingredients).  We were hoping that the last course would surprise us. Grilled swordfish with bunch of good stuff.... specials were Sea Bass as a Whole roasted fish and grilled pork with balsamic vinegrette and some stuff.... But oh man...dried grilled pork and sodium-marinated swordfish.... Salty food parade just had to end with exhaustion with the sodium overdose.  We had to ask to box the desserts (Tiramisu  lemon cake with blueberries on top  canoli with sprinkles of stuff....) because we wanted to get out asap.   I guess I'm still on a mission to find the best or better Italian restaurant in Philly.\n",
      "Stopped by this place with my parents a while ago and was blown away by the food.  The tourista menu was perfect  left the place feeling very very full! We also enjoyed the complimentary shots of Sambuca.  The portions were perfect  I didn't think I was going to be able to finish the many dishes.  Inside was noisy but that didn't matter  i'm sure my family and I were just as loud! I definetley recommend making a reservation as you most likely would not be able to get a table without.\n",
      "Great Italian restaurant. Loved the menu. Really interesting combinations. Decided on the tasting menu which was priced very reasonably considering the large portions. Thank you to Lilly our waitress and chef owner Peter who couldn't have been nicer to us as he walked around the dining room meeting and talking with all his dinner guests. Also  the busboy and other 2 waitress all very professional. Low keyed atmosphere and BYOB. Definitely make a reservation. We arrived and the dining room just starting to fill up but by the time we left  maybe one table available. Only downside is that we thought the food was a bit oversalted. Definitely will go back again.\n",
      "Modo Mio gets five stars.  I'll admit I was considering 4 because my entree wasn't exactly perfect  but I honestly think some of the other dishes were perfection.  I started this review months ago and I finally want to post it.  Modo Mio stays at 5 stars because I definitely plan to go back.   It was a special occasion the first time so I'm holding off on it  but without a doubt I want to go again.  I wish I could remember more of the specifics  but regardless so much of what we got was delicious!  It's a somewhat small space  but has a very comfortable atmosphere.  I consider the price range appropriate for a nice night out at a higher quality sit down restaurant.    Plus we took advantage of their three (or maybe four) course meal deal which at the time was $35.   The food was more than worth that price and I cant wait for a chance to give this place another shot.   Even though the entree didn't blow me away the rest was amazing and there are plenty of other entrees I'm looking forward to trying.\n",
      "I highly recommend this place! This was our first \\Chef Tasting\\\"! It was exquisite!! We had 9 courses and all were truly delicious. Wine was amazing. If you are in Philly  I highly recommend Vetri.\"\n",
      "Probably the best meal I have ever had.  We were overwhelmed with the quality of the food.  I had a smoked fish appetizer  spinach gnocchi and pasta with artichokes  a Mediterranean white fish fillet that just melted in the mouth.  Dessert I ordered was a strawberry rhubarb cobbler.  Now  we had WAY more food than what we ordered  as the chef sends out little surprises during the dinner courses.  Three hours after arriving  we left totally sated and feeling like we had just experienced something really special.  Of course  for the price  one would expect something special  but this was far beyond special--this was a meal to remember.\n",
      "\n",
      "No doubt this is one of the best restaurants in the city.  Food: I had the pleasure of trying the grand tasting menu and it was well worth every penny.  I tried Hallibut for the first time here and I was really impressed with the flavor and texture of the fish.  Get the foie gras you won't regret it.  Seriously the best food in the city.  Service: Our waitress looked like Anne Hathaway and she was really nice.  They strive to make sure you enjoy their food.  At one point she noticed that we didn't like the goat that was served as our 6th course - even though we said it was okay somehow she knew we didn't like it (I think they bugged our table).  They actually gave us an extra course of the Hallibut to make up for it - which was awesome.  Ambience: The restaurant is in a row home on Spruce street.  It's got an old feel to it and is prefect for a dinner date.  It's fancy.\n",
      "By far one of the best meals experiences I've ever had in the city. Our server Bill was fabulous  the chef came out frequently and visited our table. If you are looking for great service  food and overall experience- this place will exceed your expectations!\n",
      "Quite possibly THE BEST restaurant in philly. It's a very personal  small place which requires reservations well in advance for popular dining days times. Northern Italian fine cuisine of the highest quality by James Beard Award winning chef Marc Vetri. A visit to Vetri Ristorante is a special occasion in itself.  $$$$\n",
      "Slamming is the first word that comes to mind when wanting to describe this place! Vetri is very expensive  but I took my fiance here for her birthday as a treat. It was on her bucket list  we both love food  so I went for it. The house brined almond prosciutto was my most favorite thing we tried. I caught myself making faces like Andrew Zimmern makes when trying certain things that have such and incredible unique taste and did share with my server. It really was a treat! We did also get to see a short tour of the upstairs private kitchen and dining room which was beautiful as well. Everything tasted super fresh and each presentation was wonderfully created.  I would give them 5 stars  BUT  we did find a bone in the snapper dish they brought out  which the chef would have gotten \\chopped\\\" for and the desserts did not even come close to the amazingness of the actual meal. I feel like some places should skip the desserts and just stick everything else they do well. We will be back  just have to save up again!\"\n",
      "This is by far my favorite place in the city.  I'm on the road a lot and have dined at some of the best restaurants in the U.S. and I would put Vetri at the top of the list.  For a special occasion this just can't be beat.  I went last year from our Anniversary  I'm a foody  my husband is not and they gave him a few extra pasta dishes...it made the night perfect!  I love having Verti right in Philadelphia.\n",
      "Anyone who says that this restaurant is \\shockingly average\\\" does not know anything about fine dining.  I have eaten in famous restaurants all over the world  and this one is right up there with any of them.  I will admit that if you are looking for a \\\"scene\\\" or a \\\"trendy atmosphere\\\"  this restaurant is not for you.  However  having said that  I will say that there is no other restaurant in Philadelphia that produces food that is as interesting  fresh  and delicious as Marc Vetri's.  The service is impeccable  the menu ever-changing  and the preparations fascinatingly nuanced.  I went there tonight for my tenth time.  I took a few friends out for a celebratory dinner.  We ate their famous charcuterie plate  a special preparation of nantucket bay scallops  pig's foot ravioli  pork belly papardelle  spinach gnocci  shoulder of baby goat  salt-cured branzino  a cheese plate  lavender gelato  and chocolate souffle.  We ordered \\\"family style\\\" and enjoyed every single bite.  In fact  we ordered \\\"seconds\\\" of the papardelle and scallops because they were so delicious.  Some advice before dining at this restaurant.  First  eat family style.  It is the best way to taste as much as possible of the diverse menu.  Second  let them help you choose the wine.  The employees of this restaurant are well-versed in the nuances of their wine selections and will help you find a reasonably priced bottle that pairs well with your menu choices and preferences.  Third  when you eat here  \\\"go all out\\\".  That means  get ready to eat a lot  and prepare to enjoy yourself thoroughly.  This is a restaurant tailored for those who enjoy a cozy  comfortable atmosphere  nice people  and good food.  Again  if you are looking for a trendy restaurant  go to Morimoto.  The food won't be NEARLY as good  but you'll find all of the wannabe hipsters you can handle.  I know this is a strong review  but I believe every word of it.  There are a lot of excellent restaurants in Philadelphia that may enjoy more \\\"street cred\\\" (think Le Bec Fin  Morimoto  Buddhakan  etc.)  but certainly do not deserve it.  This restaurant is absolutely terrific  and if you walk in with an open mind (and granted  an open wallet)  you will absolutely enjoy it as much as I do.  Enjoy.  This will be one of your better dining experiences  anywhere.  --WEM\"\n",
      "Having just read about Marc Vetri and his eponymous restaurant in Bon Appetit (Sept issue)  and having a scheduled trip to Philly  we decided to visit this much lauded Italian restaurant. You might have missed this place walking by it. The restaurant has only 35 seats  a very cozy atmosphere as you would find in typical Italian restaurants. Buon Ricordo (good memory) ceramic plates on the wall remind you that this chef travels to Italy often to further immerse himself in food.  The menu is updated weekly and changes with the season. They also offer 6 and 8 course tasting menus during the summer. We called just a day before our visit (they book 2 months ahead) we were very lucky to get in! The chef and staff were so welcoming and treated us like royalty! Here's what we ate:  Antipasti - huge antipasto round with lots of yummy grilled  marinated vegetables  smoky cheeses  mixed greens with grana  and freshly sliced ethereal slices of prosciutto done a la minute and brought to our table. We also ordered the Crisp Suckling Pig with Roasted Corn antipasto that was so delicious! The chef also sent out the Foie Gras Pastrami with Cherry Mostarda (the foie gras is \\cured\\\" like pastrami - this was such an amazing dish!).  For pastas  we ordered the Mint Pappardelle with Lamb and Sweet Pea Ragu and the signature Spinach Gnocchi with Shaved Ricotta and Brown Butter. Lots of butter in the gnocchi sauce! The gnocchi were almost entirely made of spinach - and just so light and delicate. The chef also sent out a taste of the not-on-the-menu corn ravioli with shaved black summer truffles from italy. Divine!  We decided to share the main course  - another signature: Roasted Capretto (baby goat) with Soft Polenta - it was out of this world! Chef Marc Vetri presented each dish to us  and this was especially incredible - they roast the goat outdoors for hours. It was so tender!   Such a great experience and we loved meeting Marc. He is an incredible chef and we will be back!\"\n",
      "I admit I was pretty hard on Pistolas  but the service and food were horrible.  I went to the UYE cupcake/December/Jan birthday extravaganza right before Christmas. They had a really tasty Francoise Lambic that I wish I could have gotten more  except the cask ran out. Grr. The other beers were also very good  albeit expensive. The nachos I got were pretty dang tasty  with tons of chorizo and toppings on it. I think just about everyone who shared the order with me loved them. The burger I had was kinda a hockey puck though and it had a slightly off taste to it.  Casey our bartender was hilarious  entertaining  and quick with the tap. After he sang  I realized that he is infact the long lost 3rd member of Tenacious D. Seriously.   The jukebox provided good tunes. The people I was with provided good times. It was nice to see old friends and meet new ones  including the truly lovely Valissa.  4 stars for beer and nachos  2 stars for food.\n",
      "I had a great time at Jose Pistolas. Their beer selection is top notch  as they have a wide variety of IPA's and Craft Brews on tap. Along with that they have a large selection of bottled beers.  The menu seemed limited to nachos and burrito's  but as a Mexican food lover it was right up my alley. I got the Sunrise Burrito and I have to say this was one of the best burrito's I have ever had. The burrito offered a lot of different tastes and tasted like the person who made it took time and effort rather then slapping something together.  The guacamole app was delicious as well. They offered two types of salsa as well as a mountain of chips. Overall a great little place if you are in the mood for mexican\n",
      "Holy Guacamole! I mean that literally. Get the pistachio goat cheese guac  thank me later. I've been here twice now and am yet to be disappointed. The nachos (+chorizo) are amazing  but the chip to toppings ratio is a little off. We ended up ordering extra chips to get all the topping goodness. I've also had chicken tinga tacos  so flavorful! The queso and the tamarind chicken wings were just ok  stick with items above!   If you're looking for something sweet go for the churros  mostly for the chocolate dipping sauce honestly. V good  especially if you save some tortilla chips and dip in the chocolate  for some nice sweet and salty action!  Don't forget a pitcher of margs for the table  or just yourself  no judgements.\n",
      "RIP BEST NACHOS IN THE WORLD.  Did you ever love Jose's? Enjoy the chilled atmosphere and amazing food? Then STAY AWAY! Just returned after they changed up management/chef. Here is a brief list of things that ruined this favorite spot.   1)               THEY CHANGED THE NACHOS                         ........... and give you SMALLER plates that cost MORE MONEY. And by changed I mean the only thing still the same are the chips! NO MORE PICKLED ONIONS  refried beans instead of black beans  LESS salsa  Gross cheese instead of the delicious feta it used to be (feta still barely sprinkled on it  but it's doused in generic white cheese). No more half or full size orders  they are just half size orders. Instead of being $7  its now $9  and any meat add on is $4 instead of $2 to $3.5. I CANNOT EXPRESS MY SADNESS AT LOSING THESE NACHOS. they were the best nachos in the world and now they are just overpriced bleh.  2) NO MORE TASTY VEGETARIAN OPTIONS! Jalepeno popper empanadas are a thing of the past! spicy vegan burrito? not spicy anymore  just a meh blend of soy chorizo with various grains. Best black bean burger at a restaurant  NOW GONE. what they do have a portobello anything because that is all vegetarians want to eat right?  3) Atmosphere changed to bro-house rude yelling people. Came in and even though the night was pretty slow  the upstairs was super loud. There was some kind of retro SEGA game night going on that took up the whole bar section and 6 seats in the seating area. Despite the fact that no one was playing the SEGA at the table   i saw them TURN AWAY CUSTOMERS BECAUSE A SEGA WAS SITTING AT THIS TABLE FOR 6. WHAT HAPPENED?!!!!!!! Jose's used to be so amicable and nice  now its some bro-club you can't sit in to eat? WTF? annnnddd our waitress left for such long periods of time we actually had to go hunt her down to order and get out of there  because the other staff was distracted by fucking video games.   4) Menu is now UBER EXPENSIVE! Guacamole OR salsa for $11-$14???!!! No wayy......  No cheap alternatives if you just want to chill with pals and snack. You will spend at least $12 if you want to eat anything with meat in it  $10 if you are an exclusively portobello eating vegetarian. Used to be able to split a meal between friends and save some $$$ but now the food is tiny  exotic named mediocre dishes.  THIS WAS MY FAVORITE TEX MEX............I AM NEVER RETURNING.  The new chef ruined all the charm and flavor in the menu  substituting it for over-priced fancy named generic items.   Never thought this day would come when I am so disappointed in Jose's I am actually writing this bitter review of one of my all time favorite places. If you ever loved it  just abandon it. Remember the good times  don't go back. You'll just get your heart broken.    I hearby strip you of the title of Best Nachos  adios old friend.\n",
      "I DON'T EVER write reviews/yelps etc... especially being in the service industry because none of us want to hear it. BUT I will tonight.  I would've privately emailed but didn't find an address...   In short:   food and drinks and accommodating a group of 7 girls for hh was absolutely great!!! BUT your server  that took care of us is AWFUL!!! We ordered pitchers and apps  super easy  we didn't even ask for refills of water.  We're a bunch of servers having a girls hh and your server felt the need to braid her hair in the midst of not clearing the piles of dirty app plates on our table!! On top of us not drinking or eating anymore because of HER service we asked for the check.  And she felt the need to add the 20% grat herself.  I'm sorry I thought 18% grat is the norm and would've left her more if she didn't take it upon herself to leave a tip that wasn't deserving!! DO I FILL IN MY OWN TIPS ON CC SLIPS?? Oh yeah and throw the cc book on the table at your customer???\n",
      "After a long day at work I just wanted a good beer and some decent food. Unfortunately I went to Jose Pistolas.   I ordered the burrito platter  which came with rice and beans and a small side salad. I also got a La Fin Du Monde  which is an excellent Belgian style beer made in Canada. The beer was good. Sadly it was the high point of the night  aside from the smiles from the downstairs waitress and the beautiful ponytailed waitress from Montana(I hope your grandma gets better)  The rice and beans were not fully cooked. I hate crunchy rice bits and I had several. The beans were not fully cooked as well. Note to chef  soak the beans before you cook them. The salad wasn't bad  but it wasn't notable either. The burrito had nice chunks of pineapple and some nice cheese  but the meat was pretty flavorless and somehow they managed to get a lot more tortilla wrapped up in the burrito than filling. Also I didn't taste any jalapenos in it. The side verdes sauce was pretty bland and definitely not fresh. My guess is they made it up ahead of time from canned tomatillos and left it in the frig.  Compounding my annoyance at the lackluster food  I ran out of beer. I sat around waiting for the waiter. Then I had to find the bathroom. As previously mentioned the bathroom is upstairs. What they didn't mention is that there are no signs directing you to the bathroom. So I hunted around like a jackass for bathrooms. Finally I gave up and asked the bartender. I then hiked up the back entrance into the bathroom. Problem solved.   Finally I got back to my table. No waiter. I sat around for another 3 minutes of the Lakers-Nuggets game  still no waiter. Finally I got up and took the bull by the horn. I ordered a Troegs from the bartender. He actually was very nice and apologized for the lack of service and comped me the beer. I went back to my table and started sipping some Troegs. It was then that I saw something dart around out of the corner of my eye. I looked over and saw a mouse skittering across the floor. I thought for sure my tired eyes were deceiving me. Sure enough though  about 2 minutes later I clearly saw it scamper across the floor again. I told the bartender  and he apologized  but that was about it. The waiter said something lame about sharing a wall with other establishments(ie. McGlincheys).  At this point  I just wanted my check. Unfortunately I had to wait for the waiter. Usually  the waiter is supposed to wait on you. How annoying. The waiter did apologize when he rang me up. I can't tell whether the lack of service was due to inadequate staffing or he cared more about the big table on the main floor. The cynic in me thinks the latter.   No mas Pistolas. Or should I say  no mouse Pistolas.\n",
      "Terrible service. The server came to the table three times in the first two minutes while we were still getting settled. Then he never returned to take our order. When we asked for chips and salsa which we expect to be complimentary like every normal tex-mex place  we get a huge platter with guacamole  two salsas and chips that is a starter. When I explained that we just wanted the houses chips and salsa  he looked at me like I was crazy.   The server was basically watching the Phillies game at the bar the whole night and barely said two words to us. He never replaced our blown out candle. We had to ask for plates and napkins. He gave us an attitude when I asked to keep the chips on the table. Then he didn't take the plates from the table once we were done. We asked three times for a bag to take our leftovers  but the bag never came.   The bathroom was not very clean. One of the bathrooms had no light. The whole experience was ruined by the service which is a shame because I actually thought the carne burrito was quite good but I'm definitely never going back.\n",
      "First time I've been here in a while!! Came in with co-workers for happy hour on a Thursday. When we first came in it wasn't crowded  we were seated quickly and our server got our drinks started. By the time we left it was PACKED.   Happy Hour menu is good for drinks. We got a pitcher of marga for $13!! And it was good!! Unfortunately there was no food HH special  so be prepared for full price food.   Bathrooms are on the second floor... not the nicest... so be prepared.   Overall  I'd come back for HH again. Not sure if I'd do a full meal though.\n",
      "Stopped by on a weeknight.  A local Mexican place had too long of a wait time  so  Joe was a perfect alternative.  Great beer and super carnitas burrito!  Service was prompt as well.  Second bar upstairs. Friendly staff and good  though younger  crowd.    I will never wait in line at the local competitor again when I can go to Joe's . 4 stars cause the ambiance is lacking a bit (think narrower/ two level City row.).  Overall  a great place for good Mexican food and drinks.\n",
      "I am a sucker for any place with a great beer list. I don't know if you could be disappointed  it is pretty diverse...  and awesome. I have had some good dishes here as well. The Bells BBQ wings were pretty tasty and large. Chicken tortilla soup is huge and was fresh and bountiful-not just broth. Definitely will be coming here more often.\n",
      "No doubt about it  the quality and presentation of the sushi at this art museum byob is very good.  The decor inside is dark  the opposite of nearby Doma which is white  clean and contemporary.  I had the tuna and yellowtail sashimi which was fantastic  I also had a spicy tuna roll which was also very good  for a specialty roll I had the traffic light  which is tuna with red  yellow  and green roe on top.  The traffic light was good  but the roe tends to get messy.  The only downside about this place is the prices  it's not crazy expensive  but a spicy tuna roll is $8 as compared to other places like Doma and Sakura which are $5 or $6.  If I had to pick a sushi byob in the city I would have to choose Doma.\n",
      "Umai Umai is the best sushi restaurant I've been to in the area.  The place seems to be all about their special rolls (or at least it is for me)  which can often be overpriced at other sushi restaurants.  They're not cheap at Umai Umai  but they're worth every penny.  I've never been a special roll fan  but Umai Umai changed my mind completely.  You actually get a lot for your money here  and the rolls are so good I was blown away the first time I ate them.  My favorite is the Pingu by far.  If you don't mind spending a little  Umai Umai is the place to go for sure.  Update: On my most recent trip it appears they have reduced their portions and prices to go along.  I definitely preferred paying a little more and getting more  but it's still my favorite sushi place.\n",
      "Absolutely wonderful. This place is small-ish  so it's important to get a reservation so you're not waiting forever to get sushi. It is a bit far out if you dine a lot in the city  but I promise this place is worth it! I came here with a group of 6 and we literally got everything on the menu - and everything was so ridiculously delicious. If you're feeling adventurous or you're in the Art Museum area  definitely stop by this place!\n",
      "\n",
      "We had been anticipating trying this neighborhood sushi place. Positive points: it is byob  and the mixed maki rolls exceeded expectations. Note that there is no a la carte nigiri menu  so it was difficult to evaluate the fish quality.   The appetizers we ordered were an udon soup and an octopus salad. The former was uninspired and the latter overblown with smoke and vinegar. The octopus itself disappointed. The cleanliness and general condition indicates complacency. Door sticks when open  lightbulbs are out  paint chipping badly in places.   In short  we would try it again someday since it is near and byob  but would avoid appetizers.\n",
      "BEST SUSHI I'VE EVER HAD! The atmosphere was great  the service was wonderful  and the Goyza was delicious! The sushi  I can't even begin to describe! Yummy and fresh! Loved it!\n",
      "Great spot! Love the atmosphere and I wanted to try everything. When I got the menu I said  \\would you look at that!?\\\".  Unique signature rolls with fruit  nuts  and awesomeness. Appetizers and rolls were all amazing. Definitely a go to place for sushi and friendship. Highly recommended!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "by far thee best sushi place  ever. hands down. I go out to eat A lot  and this is my special place that I don't tell anyone I know about because I never want it to be crowded. we order an insane amount of food and its BYOB  solid winning combo.\n",

      "Welcome to Philadelphia!  This was the first stop on our 3 day stay in Philadelphia...I'm really glad we stopped!  It was freaking great!  I ordered a cheesesteak with whiz and onions and my buddy got one with provolone and hot peppers.  We shared some fries and got some sodas.  Good times!  The bread they use is awesome.  Its like a long torpedo roll (non Amoroso)  and its a perfect vehicle to help stuff that steak  cheese and onions into your belly.  They also use slices of steak here instead of chopped up steak.  Every single bite had bread  pieces of steak  fried onions and hot molten cheese.  It was a winner!  A tad salty though and thats the only semi bad thing about it. (I got the dried out puffy lips type salt effects...ha!).  The steak was awesome though!  Fries were good and they serve Coke products which always gets bonus points in my book!    This was a great first steak in Philadelphia!  I cant wait to eat many more!  Hopefully they will be as close to as great as this one was!\n",
      "Hands down the best cheesesteak that I've ever had! Unlike most Philly cheesesteak restaurants that serve chopped steak in their sandwiches  Steve's serves sliced beef and it made all the difference! The staff was pleasant and I will definitely return!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my favorite place for a cheesesteak in the city!  What makes it stand out?     Most importantly  the steak is thinly sliced (quality meat)  not that chopped up unidentifiable stuff served at places like Pat's and Geno's.  The steak alone makes this place special.  Yes  it's still a dive like other cheesesteak places  but it makes one hell of a good cheesesteak!!!!  Of course  they have the usual options for cheese (wiz  American  provolone)  and with (wit) or without onions.  I get mine with provolone (just not a wiz kinda girl)  wit onions  and then add extras like mushrooms  and hot peppers.  I like the ability to add hot peppers and mushrooms to the steak while it's cooking  but they also have a good \\condiments bar \\\" which allows you to add extra hot peppers  sweet peppers  thinly sliced pickles  ketchup  and relishes to your sandwich on your own (if you want). That's is a nice touch. I like the thin sliced pickles on the side  and sometimes add extra peppers. Finally  they have good fries  cheesy smothered fries  and onion rings.   Hands down: The best Cheese Steak in Northeast Philly!\"\n",
      "Growing up in Philadelphia  the cheesesteak capital of the world   I always found it strange that I didn't love the cheesesteak as much as the next diehard Philadelphian. I mean it's just bread  meat  and cheese whiz and in my case some fried onions too.   The food was fresh and prepared quickly and the best part was that you didn't feel like you are being herded like cattle lining up at the slaughterhouse when you ordered *cough* pats & genos *cough*   The sandwich was good and the meat slices were a nice change from the usual chopped meats cheesesteaks. But for 7.95 plus tax  the sandwich was a little smaller than I expected. I took one look at my cheesesteak and knew I had to order some fries at the window on the other end of the store.  I decided to order the \\spicy\\\" fries since I didn't try that before. The spicy fries weren't as good as I hoped. The fries were seriously salty  and the mix they poured over the fries tasted like instant ramen mix combined with a crapload of Morton's salt.   four star for the steak  two star for the fries so 3 stars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Best cheese steak hands down in all of Philly period. No equal in fresh soft tasty roll  original cheese whiz and a hearty portion of steak meat make this the lead favorite for so many loyal fans of this great fast fix for lunch or dinner. The staff moves at a break neck pace to serve customers quickly and efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let the tourists go to Pat's and Geno's  both of whom have had their run and have ceased to serve anything good for probably longer than I've been alive.   Steve's is where it's at. For starters  they don't use that scrambled meat that the majority of cheesesteak places uses  rather they have thin strips of well marbled beef. Sometimes  you can see them bring it out of the fridge and slice it up prior to throwing on the grill. Secondly  Steve's doesn't just slap cheese slices or drizzle the Whiz out of the can onto your steak  they keep melted American cheese and the Whiz in metal pots that are kept warm. Trust me  this makes the cheese taste better.   Right in front of the grizzle they got acceptable condiments to put on cheesesteaks. I prefer the dry roasted chili peppers myself. If you ask for lettuce  tomatoes  mayonnaise  etc. you are basically spitting on Ben Franklin's grave  so don't do it.   Steaks are pretty pricey  and they've risen in price since I've been going there  but unless they are $100 a pop  they are still worth every penny.   As a bonus  if you order a flavored soda  such as Cherry Coke for example  they won't give you a Cherry Coca-Cola but a Coke flavored with real cherry syrup just like they used to do waaay back in the day.   No matter how busy this place gets  and believe me  it gets busy  service is always fast. They have ninjas on crack in front of that grill making steaks fast.   The only downside is it is located in the NE where there generally is nothing.   Come up and try it and you'll see. You'll probably drive all the way across town to get one of these. If you disagree  then you're a silly goose! OK  if you want something \\official\\\"  Steve's has been Zagat rated several years in a row as superior.    Growing up nearby and having frequented Steve's since I was a punk kid I am quite proud to know that the neighborhood cheesesteak joint has become so popular that people make the drive from VA  and NY to get one. I am proud to read that when people from the left coast have business in Philly  they make it a point to get a steak from Steve's. Thanks Yelp for making the stories available. Now you know how far Steve's kingdom stretches.   The time has long past for Steve's to rise from prince to the true KING of steaks. We  the loyal subjects of the true king of steaks kneel before your majesty!\"\n",
      "I got some of the worst food poisoning of my life in this place several years ago and just can't fathom going back when there are so many better alternatives.   Cafe Viet Huong at 11th & Washington is just a few blocks away  has a more extensive menu and the food is way better.  Oh yeah - and it isn't filthy inside like Pho Ha.  I'll gladly pay just a little bit more to eat in a restaurant that seems to grasp the concept of hygiene.  Pho Ha is just a bit too \\rustic\\\" inside for my tastes.  Blech.\"\n",
      "Usually it's the Cheese Steak that we get when we are in Philly  but this time it was Pho.  Pho Ha is located on a Plaza and in an area full with Vietnamese restaurants. Pho Ha became our choice because of the many Yelp reviews  and it is the first Pho restaurant you see driving up to the Plaza.  The Pho restaurants I know are storefronts  little whole in the walls  but Pho Ha is a serious big place. All though big in size  it still gives you that family restaurant atmosphere. Due to the grandkids walking around while the parents are obviously cooking our Pho and granddad keeps an eye on his descendants.   The bowls are big and filled with delicious broth  there are two sizes of big  small big and large big... These bowl are no joke  and sooooo tasty and for $6.50 per bowl you can't go wrong.  Pho Ha is for sure a place you need to try out when you are in Philly  and if you like Pho or never had a Pho in your whole life!\n",
      "Best bang for your buck pho place. Their portions are HUGE. I'd say the large bowl is big enough to feed two people. I had the \\everything\\\" pho  and it's good  very comparable to Nam Phuong  which has become the benchmark for Vietnamese food for me. The meat is thinner so it tends to get all over the place (a bit messy) compared to Nam Phuong. Good broth. Also the 6th street Vietnamese strip mall is less occupied than the 11th  so it's easier to find parking here.\"\n",
      "I was pretty hyped about trying pho in Philly. We pass by this little Viet town every time we make our way towards Pat's. I asked a Josh V.   fellow yelper and friend for some suggestions and this was one of them.   Pho Ha is the corner store in this shopping lot. There's a supermarket and other various Viet stores. There's a pretty decent size parking lot but boy  nobody knows how to drive or park. Parking lanes are a bit narrow  people with large SUVs have a tight squeeze and many folks just park slanted. But the parking lot remains an upside and the street parking didn't look all that bad either.  My wife and I both ordered a large #13 on the menu. I had my pho with egg noodles  she had hers with rice noodles. We also ordered spring rolls (2)  and a side order of pork chops for our son. The pho came to our table piping hot. The broth was delicious. Just thinking about it is making my mouth salvilate. The noodle portion in my opinion could be a little more especially for a large order. The amount of tendon and beef they gave was reasonably fair. It was a good bowl of pho all around. Better than any other pho I had in New York by far. My one issue with the pho came later. Our mouths became extremely dry by the time we checked into our hotel. Both of us were just so thirsty from all the msg they used.  The spring rolls and that fish sauce is spot on. Very nice crispy texture and tender and juicy on the inside. The spring rolls here easily beat all of the Vietnamese spring rolls I've had in Jackson heights  Woodside  Elmhurst  and Flushing Queens. The sauce was well made too. I was kinda turned away that they didn't give some leafs of lettuce to roll the spring roll in. Maybe that's just a NY thing? I dunno.  The pork chops were also delightful. Nice thin cut  gently seared on both sides and kept all the juices entact. I cut pieces of the pork chop and mixed it into a bowl of pho from our order and our son finished everything. However  again  he also became very thirsty when we got to our room.   Verdict - Despite the msg  we still enjoyed the heck out of it. We finally ate something other than cheesesteaks  roast pork sandwiches and crap from Reading Terminal. If they toned down the msg a few notches or remove it entirely  the broth and everything about their pho would rank #1 on my list. It's a very busy restaurant  our waiter was friendly during the lunch rush  it was a way better experience than any pho spot I ever had I'm NY.\n",
      "Best pho in Philly. And best spring rolls. And best Soda Chahn. I guess best everything  really.\n",
      "I ain't Vietnamese ok  but gurl  I am Foodnamese and this is some good food. The service is quick and the food is so good.  I usually order the rice vermicelli w/ meat dishes. It's cash only so watch out for that. There's an ATM inside the store if you need it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really liked Pho Ha! I was very skeptical at first- the place looks super sketchy from outside  like it might be a fast food chain or something- but I am glad I let my friend from work talk me into going.  Even when you walk inside it's really sketchy. The tables are plastic and the place has the definite feeling of an Asian Shoney's. But the waitstaff is very friendly and hospitable. The menu is massive and I probably would have had trouble with it if I hadn't been with someone who knew what she was doing.   I started with the summer rolls with shrimp. Very fresh and simple and healthy. It was a good start.   Next I moved onto the chicken vermicelli roll dish. I shared this with my friend at her suggestion  though I didn't think it would be enough food. Sure enough  there was so much food that she and I could not finish and my boyfriend had to help us out! The chicken was tender and flavorful  and the noodles were cooked perfectly. It came with the rice wrappers and a bowl of warm water to moisten them  which took some time and a few botched attempts before I got it right. It also came with a massive pile of mint  which was delicious  except...beware the \\fishy mint\\\"!!!! I took a bite of a leaf  and was instantly nauseated and had to spit it out. When my waiter came over  I said \\\"what IS this  it's awful!?\\\" He looked at me with a smile and a wink and said \\\"Oh. You don't like the fishy-mint.\\\" And walked away. Quite an experience. I hope to go back soon! But will avoid any sort of seafood flavored leafy green.  Also...you would be hard-pressed to spend more than $20 here on a couple of people  and to not bring home leftovers. Portions are huge and prices are crazy cheap.\"\n",
      "What can I say? This is one of my favorite restaurants.   The pho is DELICIOUS. I always order a number 2  with steak and brisket. The pho comes with a plate of bean sprouts  thai basil  culantro(i think)  sliced jalapenos  and lime. This allows you to doctor up your pho the way you like it. Add some sriracha...maybe a squirt of fish sauce...golden!   I think I am seriously addicted to the hoisin sauce as well. I love dipping my meat in it. *snickers*  The meal would not be complete without the jasmine tea they give you while waiting for your order (it takes them like less than 5 minutes to deliver a steaming bowl to your table)  as well as some vietnamese coffee...rich  robust...floating on a cloud of condensed milk  poured over ice or hot. Seriously  if you don't know about vietnamese coffee  and you're a coffee drinker? Well...you need to learn. If you're not a coffee fan  order the jackfruit smoothie.   I eat at Pho Ha at least once a week. I have also brought at least a dozen people there so that they could experience it for the first time. You will get a fulfilling meal that only costs about 6 bucks...perfection.\n",
      "Giving this place 2 stars  the food is good  fast and is very inexpensive.  But why am I leaving 2 stars you ask?  i'm giving them 2 stars for iver charging my credit card.  My meal with tax was ~43.  So I leave 6 in tip to bring it to a total of ~49.  On my CC  they charged me ~54 ( not a big deal but that's still wrong).  Looks like someone gave themselves extra tip.  Be careful and watch out!\n",
      "A wee bit pricey for the portions they serve. I come to Beck's for their gator gumbo over jambalaya. The whole thing is just so savory and the spices are just right. It's not overly spicy and not too salty as well. It's a great meal. The gator is in a sausage form. All chopped up into the gumbo. During this visit  I had to order their pasta. Chicken alfredo  for my 2 year old son. It was alright. The whole pasta tasted a bit dry. It's something I wouldn't get twice.  Verdict - Gator gumbo  end of story.\n",
      "Atmosphere:  The craziness going on around you in Reading Terminal depends on the day and time of day that you go. It is really convenient that you can sit at the counter and get waited on there.  Service:  The staff was upbeat and pleasant.  They were the ones who recommended we sit at the counter  which was a really nice experience.  We didn't feel rushed to get out of our seats.  It was really great that they offer you a sample of the food if you are unsure.  Food:  Overall very good.  I was hoping for a bit more spice and strong flavors  but it seems like it is made marketable for the general population.  Which worked out fine with me because there were seasonings available on the counter to bump up the flavor profile.  I got the etouffee and bread pudding.  The etouffee was good  but the flavor got a little muddled after eating it for a while.  It didn't have the depth of flavor that I was hoping for.  The bread pudding was super delicious!  I would recommend it to anyone needing a sweet fix.  My friend enjoyed her jambalaya.  Overall:  I would certainly come back.  The convenient location  good service  and yummy food are all definite pluses.  I am not sure that it is the best New Orleans place in Philly  but I am happy to partake of the menu again sometime soon.\n",
      "We discovered Beck's cafe at the Reading Terminal Market last weekend. Boy am I glad we did. My wife's family is from Louisiana and Mississippi  and have a long history of cooking cajun cuisine. We had the muffaletta sandwich and shrimp crawfish etouffee. The etouffee was amazing and as good as what my father-in-law makes. The chef was knowledgeable about the holy trinity (celery  bell pepper  onion) and gave us a good tip on where to buy gumbo file powder. The bread pudding with pears and raisins was the best I've had since visiting New Orleans. We will have to go back for there breakfast beignets. They also have alligator on a stick!\n",
      "We ordered the fried oyster and the catfish platter and sincerely speaking it was terrible. Incredibly greasy and please don't tell me it is because it is Cajun food. Moreover  the service is really bad. We wanted to sit but the place was packed so we ordered food and ate while standing up. When there was finally a place the waitress was really rude and said we couldn't sit because we had already ordered food and we were already eating. Hello? Funny thing is that one of the people eating at the bar had the same exact plastic container for to go food that I had. Please  don't ask me for tips on the receipt if you are going to give me a plastic box and will not let me sit in your restaurant.\n",
      "I was fully surprise by Beck's Cajun Cafe  I never would've thought that a hole in a wall like this place that is tucked in Reading Terminal Market would be this amazing.   The staff behind the counter is a trio of mother and daughters working together. They are extremely nice and are willing to give you little samples of jambalaya or gumbo if you ask for it.  I had the Gator Gumbo with Rice and Fried Mac and Cheese ball. I was hoping the mac and cheese was good but it lacked cheese. A lot of mac inside but not even cheese so it was definitely a bit bland. The best part was the Gator Gumbo  packed with cajun spices and a lot of gator sausage and meat. This was absolutely amazing and a must get at Beck's.  A place worthy of a return when I visit Philly again.\n",
      "For years  I have lamented about the lack of good cajun food in Philly. Thank you  Beck's  for filling this GAPING void. I think the first time I tried this place  it may have been in part because the line at Dinic's was unbearably long and the throngs of people waiting were spilling over into Beck's stall space (they are next to each other)... and boy am I glad my inner fatty couldn't wait another minute because I just don't know what I'd do without this jumbalaya!   I will note that the service here is a bit terrible. Don't get me wrong - everyone is very nice  but ... SLOW-moving. VERY slow moving. I have never seen a more inefficient operation in my life  but like I said  they are super pleasant and helpful so you forgive them for taking 10+ minutes to pack  your order and collect payment (note: I've been there at least 4x and it's been true every single time).   As an example of the employees' niceness/helpfulness  as an FYI  they do let you sample pretty much any of the entrees so you can make sure it's not too spicy or too peppery etc for you.  Also  no credit card machine here so bring CASH.  WHAT WE ATE *Jumbalaya: perfect. perfect. AND it's surprisingly spicy! It's less saucy then some jumbalayas I have had  but still really flavorful and the rice is perfectly cooked. They also usually spoon on a bit of sauce on top and adds that extra flavor. IF you get the right cashier  she will upsell you the cornbread - GET IT - and eat it TOGETHER. They're not messing around when they say the cornbread + jumbalaya flavors complement each other like whoa.    *Etouffee - the flavors of the bell peppers were a bit TOO strong for my personal liking  but I could appreciate the complexity of the flavors and the spiciness here as well. My friends really liked this dish  so I did want to mention.   *Oyster Po'Boy - I thought the fried oyster was great. The breading they use to coat the po boy sandwich meats (and oysters) are really tasty and not overwhelming. I wish there was more oyster in the sandwich itself  but that would be the only complaint.   *Beignets - warm and delightfully light fried dough and generous dusting of powdered sugar make this dessert just decadent enough.   *Praline cookies - these were decent  but not the best I've ever had. The color was a bit darker than I was used to (more coffee with a splash of milk rather than latte color) and it almost tasted like they had burned/overcooked the butter or brown sugar.   Beck's also has this authentic root beer from New Orleans available. I'm not a root beer fan so haven't tried  but I keep hearing awesome things about it.\n",
      "The shrimp po boy was completely off on proportions. The bread was super thick  hard and chewy and I threw away half of it because who can possibly eat that much bread in one meal. The shrimp was good but skimpy portions. The creole sauce is  good too. I would not get it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything about this place is great. Located in Historic Reading Terminal  quick service  flavorful dishes... :)  I don't know anywhere else in Philly that you can get amazing  authentic New Orleans food.  I seriously salivate thinking about how amazing the bread pudding with the whiskey butter sauce is... MMMMMMmmmmmmm !!!!!  The jambalaya  cajun chicken alfredo  and gumbo are also so yum.   The owner (I hear also a professional caterer on the side) loves New Orleans food.   Go here when you go to Reading Terminal  trust me.\n",
      "I live in Hawaii and came to Philly for vacation. Came here before and the Gumbo is Great. My g friend sat next to me with food from another vendor. (Plenty of Open Seats). Female waitress observed this  nothing said. So she opens the wrapping to eat and female (now) advised she couldn't eat other food at their area. (Even though I was still eating my Gumbo) I understand the concept however their were plenty of open seats. So I hurried eating my Gumbo so I could sit with my g friend. No Aloha\n",
      "I had my boyfriend's 25 birthday party here with a few friends a few weeks ago. I had never been to North Bowl before  but my boyfriend had and liked it a lot. I had 2 lanes reserved for two hours  and a buffet set up to feel all of our friends.  All of the food was delicious and there was a TON of it. When you book an event here  THEY FEED YOU WELL. I didn't order a bar package  but I found the drink prices to be pretty reasonable  especially for a venue like this.  If I had to give some criticism  I'd just note that the cashier didn't really give my party any specific directions about when we'd know that our lanes were ready (a few of us had arrived early to get drinks before hand). Other than that  everyone had a great time!  Oh  and we went there the night Whitney Houston died and the establishment was sensitive enough to pay tribute to the Queen of the Night herself by playing \\I Wanna Dance With Somebody.\\\" So if you were there the night we lost Ms. Houston  yes  that was me dancing in honor of our sister in soul. God damn you  Bobby Brown. I will never forgive you.\"\n",
      "I had a wonderful evening out at a friends birthday party last night. The bartender named Katelyn is the truth ! she made the best drinks I had tasted in a long while . she created some of the drinks on the awesome menu. They had so many delicious items on the menu  I tried a few and will be back for more. The  Rabbit flautas Special was  Absolutely  amazing .A  Salmon burger on an English muffin with  red cabbage slaw and a spiced mayo a keeper. Funnel cake French fries 2 orders  so much fun .I will be back very soon to try more of the well balance taste of the North bowl which give 5 star restaurants something to think about!!!! I didn't bowl  but my friends did and had a blast the games where fun and it was so much space to talk and have a great time with friends. highly recommend with reservations\n",
      "Good thing I put a hold on the bowling wing in my mansion lol. This place spoils me grand! LOVE the fact that there is a sweet bowling alley with pool tables  pinball  and NO DRESS CODE! (Eat that Lucky Strike!)... then there's more... tater tots!  photo booth )  table pac-man  2 floors & 2bars - I recommend trying to get the upstairs lanes  there's only two but if you have enough people to get both lanes its an instantly like having the bar and bowling in your living room! The staff is awesome and friendly as well as eye catching ) There's a special on bowling every Sunday & Wednesday after 10pm... Have fond memories of bowling from my childhood and look forward to many more because of this place- keep it up!\n",
      "Nice spot for bowling in the city   seems nice packed   good music . Nice old school look spot. With upbeat tech. Outside is very clean and dog friendly\n",
      "Ah  North Bowl. I give it more like 3 and a half stars. How did someone not yet mention their AMAZING black and white photo booth? Oh gaaaawd  that's the best part! I showed all of my friends the great shots we took and loved that. Okay  it loses a star because the server brought me actual mini corn dogs  not the veggie ones I ordered. But I didn't even ask for a change  because it was so busy and I was so hungry by the time they came.\n",
      "most important thing to know about north bowl:  THEY HAVE THE MOST RIDICULOUSLY AMAZING AND REALISTIC VEGGIE WINGS I HAVE EVER EVER EVER TASTED.   after craving chicken wings for the past 3 years ive been veggie  i have finally been able to get something so close to the real thing that i no longer have to crave chicken wings. amazing. they are well known for their amazing tots (i like the buffalo kind)  but they should be known for these wings  too.  ok. wednesday's here - $2 tots and $2 bowling (after 10). there's always a  waitl ist though so you might wanna go early and put your name in. early as in before 9. there's a bar downstairs and upstairs while you wait.  the decor is nice  sleek  and modern. there's a big lebowski screen shot on the wall. great seating at the actual alleys.  and my second favorite thing after veggie wings: an oldschool photobooth for those cute date photos.\n",
      "Once again  North Bowl provided the setting for a fun get together with our friends and family in the 215. Good as ever.  One problem that cost a star: Lanes 7 & 8 kept experiencing trouble -- odd lane resets (or no resets)  trapped balls  etc. The mechanic is always fast to help  but it happened a lot this time. That said  it still isn't bad enough to kill the buzz. Thanks again  North Bowl.  Note: Make sure you call ahead for reservations if you're playing on weekends. That makes all the difference.\n",
      "If I could provide zero stars - I would.  North Bowl used to be a fun spot for bowling and beverages in nolibs...sadly  it has become riddled with less than desirable clientele  bartenders who tip themselves  counter staff who are beyond rude to everyone and a security guard wielding a gun.   I went to North Bowl with a group of 10 friends for a birthday party.  We expected that the wait would be long on a Saturday night but 4 hours is a bit ridiculous.  We arrived at 8pm and were told to stop back in 1 and a half hours to actually get our wait pager.  The group proceeded upstairs to order drinks and food while we waited.  The food was served cold...nothing like icy tater tots and skin on your melted cheese to start your night off right.  The bartenders also enjoyed keeping change from my friend's $20 instead of letting her decide how much she'd like to tip.  There was also a lovely display of class in the ladies' room with broken glass in each of the sinks...  During our wait we noticed another group of patrons at the next lounge area who appeared to be having a good time until an altercation began between a man and a woman.  They began yelling in each other's face and then became violent with hair pulling  pushing and slapping.  The armed officer who had been patrolling the facility noticed the incident and broke up the fight.  He then told the man that he was to leave only to have another man in the group argue with the officer as well as other women in the group.  They gave the officer extreme attitude and even said \\It was [their] right to be here\\\"...he then proceeded to throw the entire party out only to experience more refusal and pushback.  I'm sorry...it's your RIGHT to get violent and begin fighting at a bowling alley and then demand that you should stay??  Their behavior was extremely unacceptable but I was only further shocked when the manager and security guard allowed the group to remain!    At about midnight  our pager finally buzzed and we went downstairs to bowl.  The $15 per person for 2 games is always a hard pill to swallow but I digress. After such a long wait  we were definitely ready to get our evening started.  As the birthday girl began her turn to bowl  we noticed that her ball didn't return.  She threw another and that also didn't come back.  After the second and third members of our group went and experienced the same issue we pushed the \\\"Help\\\" button.  After waiting 10 minutes  one of our friends had to walk over to the counter to request help in-person.  The guy walked to the back of the lanes and then came out front to address the issue.  After another 10 minutes we resumed bowling only to have the lane break again after 2 bowlers.  Our friend walked over again twice more to have various problems addressed by the staff.  The manager should have recognized that this was a major issue and offered some type of compensation - especially since we were approaching 1am and hadn't even completed 4 frames of our first game (I have to reiterate that we waited 4 hours to bowl and this was what we waited for?!).    Finally  we had had enough.  When the birthday girl approached the counter with her receipt and asked for our money back  the woman behind the counter gave her extreme attitude.  For some reason  she couldn't understand how we'd be upset after waiting 4 hours  paying over $100 to bowl  not including the $200+ in food and drinks  and then experiencing 3 separate problems that caused stoppage in our game.  She was told only $12 per person could be refunded but not the $3 for shoe rental - I thought that was complete BS...give me my full amount.  The girl literally threw the money at my friend - literally.  They did allow us to finish our 1 and only game - at least until the lane broke again.   My friend called the following day and asked to speak to the general manager about the unpleasant experience.  She was told the GM would return her call - she's still waiting.   Overall  our experience was so disgusting that I don't plan to EVER return to North Bowl.  I hope their complete disrespect to paying  decent customers while catering to clientele who start fistfights serves them well.  I'd rather go to Lucky Strike or the burbs for bowling...it's definitely not a 4-hour drive.\"\n",
      "Out with a friend a few nights ago  we decided to go to North Bowl  since I utterly failed to get tickets for the Body Worlds II exhibit at the Franklin.  Yes  they're easy to get  and yes  I am an idiot  and yes  my procrastination got the better of me.    Note to self: Do not wait until the last minute to buy tickets for ANY exhibit  anywhere  at any time. It is rarely successful.   Remembering my Yelp friend Monica's review for North Bowl  I knew there were a few recommendations to remember when I got here. I think the first thing I noticed is that sadly  the vending machine did not have any of the 1950's era  three-dollar \\How to Get Along With Girls\\\" booklets in stock  which I really really wanted  because it sounds hilarious. Maybe I can get one from Amazon. Another thing I missed out on is ordering the award-winning Tater Tots (next time for sure)!  I'm not joking - they really have won awards - you'll see!  And the lastly  there was no way I was going to \\\"let her win\\\"...because my friend Michelle is an avid bowler and is more than capable of winning without the slightest bit of my help!  (She won the second of two games).   In the end  it was a really good time. The beer selection is quite nice....not huge  but very good in what they do offer. I would also stick with the popular suggestion of going here during off-peak hours (weekdays/nights). It's not a very big bowling alley  and it's easy to see how it could be packed on a weekend night.  It's also a tad expensive  but who cares - it's not like you're going to bowl here THAT often. It's definitely something fun for a change.\"\n",
      "This place is fantastic when you can get a lane.  My group waited for several hours one Saturday night and ended up getting too drunk to bowl anyway.  They give you a beeper that buzzes when your lane is free and ours never buzzed  sadly...  Instead  we just played pool on the mezzanine level and chilled on the couches.  There are also some mini private lanes upstairs that can be rented out for private parties.  Star off for the ridiculous waiting times.  Also  the area is a bit scary at night with my friend being robbed at gunpoint while walking home from the lanes (only two blocks).  But don't let that put you off.  If you wanna bowl  bowl!  Don't let a little gun crime stop you.\n",

      "A nice bowl of hot ramen for dinner is always a good choice. I went to other ramen shops around Philly and always got the miso soup. With this place  I got a large and felt it was a standard size while the regular was pretty tiny. Prices were a bit higher than other shops. The plus is that there is lots of seating and the way they prepare their pork belly was great. Big slice cuts of pork has lots of flavors than thin slices. The broth was good as well as everything in the ramen.\n",
      "The ramen was alright and not as great as the ones in Manhattan  NY.  But food was at least 3 stars and environment was 4 stars. Unfortunately I just noticed that what I tipped them on my credit card was not what was shown on my statement. They had the guts to add an additional $4 on my card while I have tipped them $5 on a $31 total meal.  Be careful of your credit card. Therefore they gave themselves a 28% tips. Am going to see if I can dispute it since it have been a few months.\n",
      "I just came in to try their snow ice  I was very happy with it. I got the matcha snow ice  which comes with azuki bean  condensed milk  grass jelly  strawberries  and fried rice cakes. This place looks very clean and customer service is awesome. I will definitely come back to try different things maybe in a month or two when their credit card machine becomes available.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is another favorite \\value meal\\\" place in Center City for me. I've been slowly working my way through the army of restaurants in Chinatown and had my doubts about this new ramen place. I'm so glad  I tried it. The place is charming in an authentic Japanese ramen shop kind of way (I've been to Japan) and all the food presentation was first class. I had the shoyu ramen with chasu pork  it was both pretty to look at and tasty to eat. Our waiter was fantastic. As a bonus  water was served in little chem lab beakers and the check came slipped into a manga comic book. Enjoy a really great meal and service for what you'd spend at a fast food joint. Good job  Yamitsuki!\"\n",
      "I walked in one day and was falsely accused of not paying a bill that was left by a group of people last week. Apparently  the waitress there mistake we were the group of people that \\did not pay\\\" the bill. I was treated as a thief and that really piss me off. This place need a better surveillance system. They can not show proves nor they were sure if it was us. The waitress treated us with a very bad attitude. I will never come back here again. If you need a good ramen place  go to Terakawa. I went here because terakawa was packed. They overcharged and the only ramen that actually taste ok is the Karai. Yamitsuki owes me and apology!\"\n",
      "I give three star because the service and shaved ice were really good but the ramen was just disappointing. The sliced pork was tough to eat  soup lack of flavor... I am glad we ordered Matcha shaved ice  it was good looking and delicious and it probably would be the only reason I'd come back to this place.\n",
      "Being within walking distance to this spot is one of the main reasons why I miss living in Bella Vista Hawthorne. Perfectly designed space  baristas that are the opposite of a lot of Philly douchebag baristas  excellent coffee  and a ton of charm.\n",
      "No matter how crowded it may seem when I've walked through the door  I'm always greeted with a sense of calm.  It's the ease of the service  the mood of the music  the ever changing talents of artwork on the walls  and the soothing coffee drinks.  For serious  I've never been let down by their luscious concoctions.  If you can grab a table or even a comfy chair in one of the middle rooms  you're sure to fall in love with it  too.  And I don't know who the hell controls the music selection in there  but oh my damn...they should be programming their own radio station at this point.  Amen.\n",
      "I was in Philadelphia on a trip  and was looking for a cute coffee house. I must have come on an \\art night\\\" (not sure how often a week this happens) because the place was packed. It was about 8pm  there was no place to sit  and barely enough room to move. This is fine  it's an event  you can't rate a place based on that. But... the barista  a twenty-something guy with long hair  was so unpleasant it ruined the whole experience for me. I asked about sandwiches  he said they were all out. Of ALL of them. Okay. I asked about a coffee. He said they didn't make that particular style. No biggie. So I order a plain iced coffee and day-old danish  and as he is ringing me up  I ask about what was going on and if it was always this busy  as this was my first time. He looks at me and shrugs  \\\"I don't know.\\\" Seriously?   He must have made my coffee and placed it on the counter without me knowing  because next thing I know he's making a smoothie. I'm watching him  confused  and we made eye contact several times. It wasn't until he served that smoothie to someone else  he lets me know my coffee is ready.   I can't rate the coffee shop since it was an off night  and the coffee was decent  but a talk with the staff about courtesy and customer service could go a long way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great coffee  good food. Wonderful light in all the rooms -- even the basement. My only critique is that it is so popular that it is often hard to find seating later in the day.\n",
      "Dear Chapterhouse   I dont feel loved or appreciated anymore.  You never smile when you see me.  You don't enjoy making me coffee in the morning like you used  you never put the cute lil java art on the cappucinos anymore... I have found another who smiles and likes to make me coffee  better coffee  with a smile....so long....  Sincerely  Brew Ultimo's new girl\n",
      "Not a coffee shop for coffee lovers... Lots of flavored mochas lattes and whatnot built on over roasted espresso.  Urban modern hipster vibe inside with typical ambient music.  Interior design is nice. Lots of seating with wifi. If you're into the flavored \\coffee\\\" drinks  sandwiches and whatnot (like my wife)  this place will be great for you.\"\n",
      "Excellent location  lovely vibes inside  pleasant happy staff.  Starbucks is fine if you're on the Jersey turnpike  but if you have the choice  go for something a little special and have a cup at the chapterhouse.\n",
      "Great ambience. Adorable dog. Coffee is yummy as is Mexican hot chocolate. Service is great too. Can't think of a single thing I disliked. A longer  less telegraphic review when I'm at a computer stop\n",
      "\n",
      "First I'd like to say  I really like what they've done with the place. I remember when it was Thomas' and it looks like they've updated the decor  torn down the middle wall so it's nice and open  and the bathrooms (which were previously a DEE-SCUSTING) were quite cozy  clean and nicely decorated. 5 stars for ambiance.  I came here with a couple of friends  one being gluten intolerant  this is the only place in Manayunk that offers an extensive gluten-free menu. The plates are small  but they did mention that they're meant for sharing. Well  they were kind of in between  so I think the Goat's Beard is not really sure if it's skimpy plates or tapas. And it's not what I'd think of as sharing kind of food  so they really need to hammer that out if you ask me. We all got our own plates anyway. The waitress was way overly enthusiastic about how good the food was. \\The lady doth protests too much me thinks.\\\" I had the fish tacos  which were ok  but pretty soggy. My friend had the steak mac and cheese which the waitress RAVED about. That was ok too. I mean  it's kind of hard to mess up pasta  cheese and meat. The wings would have been good if they weren't so sugary. It wasn't bad. I think it was just really over-hyped. I don't think they've been open long  so hopefully there will be improvements. 3 stars for food.   We sat outside  which is a plus  but i have to say  those have to be some of the most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat in. Everyone else agreed. My second time here  my boyfriend even noted that as well. Backs are too low and lean back too much. The wooden planks that make up the chair are a world full of hurt against your tooshie. You cannot get comfortable to save your life. 1 star for poor choice in seating.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I ate brunch and dinner here several times and overall the service was great  drinks were good  and the food was delicious...the only dish I did not like was the shrimp and grits dish which the grits were made with a savory flavor which I felt just didn't compliment the grits or the shrimp. Other than that you should definitely check out the restaurant  loved the Mac and cheese gnocchi  the various types of fries  chicken wings (awesome)  and the vegetable Napoleon (my fav).\n",
      "Typically I'll write a review on various sites if the place I use comes up short. In other words I don't get motivated too often to compliment. The Goat (Goat's Beard) has changed that for me. First of all  the surroundings are super comfortable and I wish I lived a little closer so I could frequent this place more often. It is what I always pictured a bar with great food should look like.   For starters  the Goat's chicken wings are incredibly unique which during the first time I visited put me in a really good mood. Where else can you pick between scallops (scrumptious)  duck (perfectly done) lamb (succulent)  fish tacos (de-lish) and the unbelievable steak mac and cheese in a comfy bar setting that is conducive to camping out for the evening. I guess I sound a bit over the top but when I see a place that is unique in a world full of \\sameness\\\" it pumps me up.   The menu is really geared to small plates. If your are starving and want to pig out on the cheap  this is not the place. The food is impeccable which I will take over generous portions any day. There is something for everybody on the menu. As I said the wings are great and I hardly ever order them. Wings are now  a staple for me here though. I have been to the Goat three times now  and everyone in my group was not disappointed and were pretty much over the top like me about the food.  Service was very good especially for a place that has been open for a pretty short period. I think it was opened in March. The thing that stands out about the servers is their enthusiasm. One time they made a mistake on my order and the way they handled it was extraordinary. I hope this friendliness continues as word of the Goat spreads.   The bar is cool. Different drafts make for a great selection of beer. I enjoy the harder stuff so I can attest the drinks (both brown and white) were excellent. The truth is someone here knows what they are doing. I really think this is the kind of place that can replicate to other areas if they can create the same unique atmosphere and maintain the quality of the food and service. Folks  you will really like this joint!!!!\"\n",
      "I'm writing this a little late but I can't stop thinking about this cute little place. My boyfriend and I were visiting a friend this weekend and Goat's Beard was recommended. It was a beautiful  night so we grabbed a table outside  ordered a Kentucky mule and the BF got a Manhattan. Naturally I was starving and wanted something hardy so I went with the Steak Mac and Cheese. Perfectly seasoned meat and the gooey cheese sauce made it even better. My boyfriend had the fish tacos but wouldn't even let me try it  I guess they were good. We sat for a little longer while the BF tried different kinds of bourbon and enjoyed the night.  Although I'm just a visitor  I bet this place is great with locals. It has a big bar area that is great for grabbing some wine and cheese on a weekday. Also nice that the staff is very friendly and really knows their liquor.\n",
      "Very good food. Staff is genuinely friendly.  This is a great place for a first date  but call ahead. Your chance of getting a few seats at the bar are slim post Happy Hour. Late night music is excellent with fresh young talent playing oldies to new stuff.  I have even seen Philly legend Kenn Kweder play there.\n",
      "Came here for an early dinner  just in time for the tail end of happy hour so appetizers and drinks were discounted.  Buttermilk wings are a must try.  Wings were large  very well fried and had the perfect amount of sauce and tanginess.  My new favorite 'wings' in philly.  Previously my favorite wings would have been cafe soho's garlic soy flavor just to give you an idea of what kind of wing I'm putting it up against.  Definitely not your average bar food as everything we tried was good. Steak mac and cheese using gnocchi  fish and chips with a unique tartar sauce  etc.  I look forward to trying more of their menu.\n",
      "Terribly overpriced for the selections offered. They're trying to recreate some kind of center city Passyunk type of hip atmosphere  but it takes more than overpriced food and terrible service to make that happen. Save your money and go to any of the other great places on main st.\n",
      "Yum! Came here for happy hour snacks and man were they delicious. I love places that offer exotic flavored french fries and man did they deliver  and also the goat nuggets are little nuggets sent down from the Gods  ) The seasoning on both dishes was yummy and they were so big that it ended up being my dinner despite sharing it with people.   The atmosphere is romantic yet fun and the servers were all super knowledgable  friendly  and attentive.  This will definitely be a go-to spot for me and I'll continue to update as I try more things here!\n",
      "I am shocked this place is so well-regarded.    1. They ran out of bread.  Who the hell runs out of bread?  I had to eat my lame pepper steak in a tortila.  Worse - the staff was annoyingly jovial about the issue and said \\Oh  we always run out of bread.\\\"    Well  if you always run out of bread  DEMAND IS CLEARLY HIGHER THAN SUPPLY - ORDER MORE!    Now  I am no Wharton graduate  but this should be obvious.  2. Beside the bread issue  my pepper steak was below average.  Just kinda 'bleh'.  3. Also had the chance to try the 'chimichanga' which was flat out disgusting.  It tasted like all the ingredients (beans  rice  etc) were bathed in dirty dish water before being added to the wrap.  Horrible.  I eat meat  but I also love creatively done vegan/vegetarian stuff.  I've been to Horizons  Red Bamboo  etc. . . and this place really doesn't hold a candle to anything like that.\"\n",
      "There are two schools of vegetarian: those that embrace vegetables -- from beans to greens to grains -- and the 'meat substitute' kind.  Lately  restaurants have been trending toward the former  but Govinda's is squarely in the old camp.  Perhaps faux-meet vegetarian can work  but it doesn't at Govinda's.  My \\burger lover's\\\" wrap contained a soy-based \\\"meat\\\" with a pungent after taste.  It was so unappetizing that neither I nor my companion could finish it.  The other dinner  a \\\"meat\\\"ball sandwich  was at least palatable  but only barely so -- with generous camouflage courtesy the cheese and tomato sauce.  The French fries we shared were greasy and soggy.  (We did eat in the quick-serve area closer to the corner of Broad & South  the dining room was closed for renovations  and perhaps that menu might be different).  Can meat-substitute vegetarian restaurants work?  It has been done successfully -- the Horizons restaurant comes to mind.  But for me  this sort of place gives vegetarianism (and veganism) a bad name.  Implicit in eating here is a sort of compromise: the food tastes weird  and to the degree that it's editable  it's because it's been smothered in cheese  as in each of the items in our order.  Rather  a better (and tastier) model for vegetarianism is to embrace all vegetables  and create delicious dishes  not poor meat substitutes.  Beans  cous-cous  hummus  yellow rice  bell peppers  asparagus  green beans -- all can be ingredients in delicious dishes.    But Govinda's takes the other approach -- vegetables are just along for the ride.  Until restaurants like this one get the message  vegetarians/vegans are doomed to the stereotypes  we're going to have to keep answering the question \\\"how can you eat that stuff?\\\" and \\\"if all you can eat is salads  don't you get hungry?\\\"  So  in sum  the ingredients were reasonably fresh  but the faux meat was revolting.  Go elsewhere.\"\n",
      "I wish I could give this place a better review  as the 'chicken' cheese steak is great. However  the service here is sooooo slow that it makes me reluctant to stop in. Even when I tried calling ahead  I still found myself waiting.   Be prepared to wait.\n",
      "Love this place  staff seems to change often so service can be hit or miss but food is great. Highly recommend you try vegan or not.\n",
      "So I was really excited to eat here after reading the reviews and it didn't live up to the hype for me. It was pretty good food  not terrible but the atmosphere was just too crowded and dingy for me. We wanted to eat at the fine dining part but I wasn't really sure how to get into it so we just walked into the \\to-go\\\" part. There really isn't much room to stand if there's a line and it's really tiny  there are as few seats on the other side but not that many.   I got the soy ham and egg salad wrap on a chili wrap  I'm not gonna lie  I thought it was real ham and when I took my first bite I thought it was amazing. After eating more and more  I started to not like it was much  I think the ham had a different after taste since it's not really ham. I think the idea of eating the ham again made me a little nausaus. I don't think it's because of the food but just me over thinking it. My boyfriend got the Golden Tofu wrap (I think) with a wheat wrap and I thought that was really good. The rice in it tasted really good. We had gotten the chicken nuggets as an appetizer but it came out half way through our meal so we weren't that hungry to eat it. It tasted and peeled like real chicken  crazy! I'm not a big fan of BBQ sauce  which is what they give  but overall those were pretty good. We got ice cream as dessert and it was good! I loveeeeee mint chip ice cream and they had just that.  I know you're thinking so why 3 stars? It's more for overall appearance along with food. I guess I can't expect too much in Philly to be spotless but it is what it is. It was just a little too small and crowded for my liking.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I had hi hopes for Govinda's because the reviews are great and I love a good vegan-friendly place  being a vegan myself. Unfortunately the food did not live up to my expectations. I ordered the golden tofu wrap on the spinach tortilla  a brownie  and a samosa. The wrap was supposed to have peppers  tahini sauce  rice  and soy cheese along with the tofu. All that was in my wrap was rice  a creamy sauce and tofu. The brownie and samosa were fine  but since I came for dinner  I am pretty sure they had been sitting out all day. Also the cheesecakes are extremely over-priced and were just tossed into the freezer  many upside down. The food is priced pretty good for vegan food but it felt unorganized and messy.\n",
      "3 and a half star average? Really? So it's between 'A-OK' and 'I'm a fan'? So  what does that make it? 'I'm OK'? How very humble of you  Philly.  Well  I have to say that you're more than OK. I was overwhelmed by your warmth. I'm not talking about the summer heat  but the 22 responses within 12 hours to my 'Veggie Cheesesteaks?' talk thread a week ago. You guys are awesome.  And why not when you have places like Govinda's to eat? This place is 'the dog's'  as we say in England. I'll leave it to you to see what that means.  I had the Chicken Cheese Steak and was blown away. I think I checked three times just to make sure I wasn't breaking my rules and actually eating meat. It was soooooo delicious. And at just $8 is great value. I loved the veganaise sauce and the vegan cheese... there really was nothing I didn't like about it.  The best thing about this place for me is its self-awareness. I really got the feeling that they know what they are and they're fine with it. They don't pretend to be anything more  they aren't so pretentious to jack up the prices because they know they make awesome food  and they sell delicious extras like funky juices and massive cookies.  I'll definitely be back when I'm next in town. And I'll be sure to go anywhere else Philly Yelpers recommend!!!\n",
      "Ok so I'm from Connecticut but all of my family lives in Philly so when I visit I make it my mission to go to Govindas. This place is my first stop when I'm get there and the last when I'm going. I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything when I get the chicken cheesesteak and I always get a couple to go. Make sure to get it in a hard roll  the wrap is good but the roll is better. Also try a couple of their donuts  they're better than non vegan ones!\n",
      "as a vegetarian living in center city  sandwich options are severely limited. philly just does not seem to be a sandwich town. instead  we have to make due with hoagies  subs  whatever you call them.   govinda's is the go-to place for vegetarian and vegan friendly fare. but i have to say  i've become a little disappointed over time.   i used to rave about this place  but recently i've noticed that portions have gotten smaller and prices have gone up. i realize that shadow inflation is happening all over the place and our corporate media is afraid to talk about it  but it hurts even more when prices go up while quality and quantity go down.   when i am in the mood for fake meat sandwiches  i get either the pepper steak sandwich or the chicken cheese steak. others have described the latter in detail  so i won't go into it. the former  however  is equally tasty in a completely different way. the gooey  saucey fakey meaty concoction lights up your taste buds and glazes your fingers into something even a veg might contemplate nibbling on.   sometimes i also get the chicken fingers  which are inappropriately named. i don't know what to call them because they're somewhere between a finger and a nugget. maybe chicken mini fillets? anyway  for fakey chicken they are tasty  but somewhat overpriced at $1/mini fillet. when i say mini  i mean it.   golden tofu is recommended by others i've eaten with  if your compelled to like that sort of thing. i am not. i suck at tofu.   desserts are of the vegan variety and even though i hear good things  i can't bring myself to eat $6 dairy-free desserts. damn wisconsin upbringing.   finally  get a tattoo in a visible location before eating here if you don't want to feel out of place. this advice is for the two of you that live in philadelphia without a visible tattoo.\n",
      "Last weekend I rented one of Fuji Mountain's private karaoke rooms as a surprise party for my boyfriend and 20 of his friends. I stopped in a week prior to check out the place and spoke with John the manager. He was very pleasant and answered all of my many questions over the phone and by email. Our party was in a large 40 person karaoke room with its own bar! We each paid $35 to have an open bar for 3 hours which was amazing! Our bar tenders Sam  Tim  and Alice were a lot of fun and helped us out with anything we needed.  I did not have any food  but a couple of my guests did and said it was great! I would highly recommend this restaurant for any karaoke parties!\n",
      "Love  love love this place! Huge rolls compared to other places. Calamari with the avocado sauce is great. Washington roll and King Cali Crab roll are a must try. Prices are pretty decent considering the downtown  and service is always good. Just ok for karaoke  Yakitori has better karaoke rooms and better selection of music  and you can actually pay separate tabs. In Mt Fuji's karaoke room  there's only one bill per room  which can be a hassle at the end of the night when divvying up who bought what........\n",
      "Food was awful! This place has really gone downhill. Horrible customer service. Host should have taken at least the main course off our bill  chicken teriyaki! It was undercooked! No way were we eating it. Sushi and Maki rolls used to be good now it's mushy and very fishy even if no fish in it. It's a shame. Used to be our go to spot in this part of Philly.\n",
      "This happens to just be right next to our apartment so the bf and I have been frequenting here literally once a week. We usually get take out - my favorite is the volcano roll and the negitoro roll (pretty good for the price). My bf usually gets the katsu because it's a pretty good deal and fills him up - it comes with generous slabs of fried katsu  soup  salad  rice  and a slice of orange.  I also tried the salmon platter and various other rolls previously but def. just recommend what I had mentioned above if you wanna save some money and satisfy your sushi craving.\n",
      "so many great things to say about this place. open late and they continue to make great sushi. I've been coming here for 10+ years and the quality is always consistent. I highly recommend the mixed ceviche which is my favorite thing on the menu besides the wasabi tobiko -- also can't go wrong with the chirashi or sushi sashimi combo meals. sashimi is always fresh  service is always exceptional  and have never had a bad experience.\n",
      "Overall a good place. It can be a little pricey for the size of the rolls and sushi  but everything is fresh! Also its great for late night sushi! The restaurant is a fun atmospher and they have private rooms for karaoke!\n",
      "While the sushi at Fuji Mountain is not the most imaginative or highest quality I've ever had  it's very consistent.  I've never had a bad experience there  but never had one that I write home about  so to speak.  However  in my experience  the service can't be beat.  They are exceptionally kind (we're regulars  so maybe that helps).  Do try their specials board  but it's not a guarantee.  Also  there's good meal options for all diets and budgets (using any sushi place as a baseline).\n",
      "Great service - always prompt with seating when I have reservations  waiters are always pleasant and attentive. Good food - the rolls are tasty  although they used to be a bit larger. Decent beer list. Great place for date night.  Quiet comfy atmosphere without all the crowding you see at other Center City sushi joints. Go back? - All the time.\n",
      "Was here for a karaoke night in the small bar upstairs.  Sushi was good (I mostly had nigiri) Cocktails were good (white russian & sake mojito) Service was good.\n",
      "Came here and ordered the california roll  arizona roll (with yellowtail  scallion  masago  and spicy sauce) and spicy scallop roll.  We also shared the fried calamari and  \\dynamite mussels\\\" (new zealand mussels stuffed with a spicy sauce).  The fried calamari came out looking like onion rings  lightly fried  not too oily  pretty tasty.  The mussels were good  couldn't recognize the sauce.  The sushi rolls were all freshly made  with the rice soft  sticky  and warm.  The scallop roll actually came out as chunks of scallop  instead of ground (??) scallop I usually get.  All of the rolls were tasty!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My first time here was great.  Beautiful outdoor seating (so dog friendly!) and great  attentive service.  Their beer list is great with great prices.  I LOVE their vegetarian friendly menu as well.  They're not your typical vegetarian selections but very unique (like a cauliflower crust pizza with mushrooms - delicious!).\n",
      "A friend and I took a chance on this place after reading their menu one night.  I'm so happy we did!  The mussels are to die for and I LOVE BELGIAN BEER!  There's no shortage of beer here  the list is endless.  Our waiter Ken was patient and very helpful. I can't wait to go back and eat drink more.\n",
      "Brunch at Belgian Cafe was very good today. I had the chefs omelet special  tomato & Brie  Loretta loved the peppers & scrambled eggs. Coffee is strong had 2 & half cups each.  Very reasonably priced. Wil go there again and again.\n",
      "Very great meal and to add a compliment - our waitress Megan gave us a credit on one of our burgers because it was not the temperature we had asked for (was well done and we had asked for rare). We didn't even ask for the credit she just gave it to us  which made it even more meaningful. I am the general manager of a cafe in New Jersey and long story short I had just gotten into an argument with a vendor last week because they were {inexplicably} an entire day late with my shipment of perishables and they didn't even offer a discount or credit and I told them how crappy of a business practice that was. In my cafe if someone disliked his or her sandwich or anything else they would and DO get full refunds because I believe that is a good business practice. So in closing I really commend that waitress for sharing good business practice and values  that is the reason I have given this cafe five stars.\n",
      "If Yelp allowed half stars I'd probably rate Belgium a 3.5. Incredible beer selection  awesome mussels  and chill cozy atmosphere make this a neighborhood favorite of mine. The service at the bar is sometimes hit or miss but overall I really love this place for dates or just grabbing a beer with friends. Looking forward to warmer weather to enjoy the outdoor seating again.\n",
      "We went here on a sunday around 2pm for a late lunch/brunch.  Sat outside since it was a beautiful day and who doesn't love sitting on green street.  I will not be going back here again however.  I ordered a coke and a cheeseburger with lettuce  tomato  onion and swiss cheese. Cooked medium with a side of fries (since yelpers say the fries are good here)  waited 15 minutes for the Coca cola.  waited another 15 minutes for the burger.  Burger was burnt. Teeny Tiny on a Roll that tasted like nothing. oh yeah and i asked for ketchup  something salvage this burger. waited 5 minutes for ketchup.  I'm not sure why yelpers love their fries so much? they arent a crisp fry so if you dont like crispy fry then okay fine. But how do you warrant a french fries that are only 1 inch long? its not exactly appealing having to grab hold of fries with your finger tips  6-7 fries at a time.  Living so close to the Belgian cafe it is so disappointing that it wasnt a home run.  Guess ill be continuing on down the street back to st. stephens.\n",
      "Waitress (from the table next to us) dropped a glass of milk on the floor next to the table where my friend and I were eating.  It splashed all over use.  She was very apologetic  and brought a wet cloth so we could try to clean up a bit (cloth didn't help much).   Slow service. Food came.  Good fries.  Soup was just OK  room temperature  not hot.  Then the bill came.  Our waiter had quoted us a price that was much less then the item appeared on the bill.  I pointed this out to the waiter.  He just said \\sorry.\\\"  The manager said the same.  For the milk spill  they should have paid for part  if not all of the bill.  Also  they didn't reduce price of misquoted item.  No change to the bill at all.  Tacky.\"\n",
      "Awesome beer list  both on draft and in the bottle. I had a chance to try Harviestoun's Ola Dubh  a collaboration between Harviestoun Brewery and Highland Park Distiller that ages Harviestoun's already delicious Old Engine Oil beer in malt whiskey casks. I'd have to place this beer in my top 5.   The food is great as well  loved the veggie burger topped with blue cheese and the fries are awesome. I was less impressed with the desserts so save yourself the calories and order another beer. Cheers!\n",
      "I've been trying different Philadelphia eateries for the past few days (visiting) and I've got to say this place is highly underrated on yelp.  My food was fantastic  I got a veggie burger with blue cheese and fries.  The beer list is huge and varied.  I love the neighborhood and the atmosphere too.  A little pricey  but worth it overall.  Great vegan burger!!\n",
      "Authentic Mexican food this is one of my favorites  I've ordered many dishes been pleased every time  they also make a mean breakfast  great service\n",
      "We ventured here during our week of all Mexican food. We didn't plan it as such  but we can't get enough of fresh ingredients and simple eating.   This place is a true gem. Meal started with some free chips and salsa. The salsa verde was tangy and packed some heat to it  so good. The original salsa was a bit on the \\canned tomatoes\\\" taste though.  We each got three tacos: grilled steak  al pastor  and chorizo. They were served on double corn tortillas (soft and delicate). The steak and al pastor were a bit on the dry side  but I will give them the benefit of the doubt that on another day it would be real moist. The chorizo was spot on. I didn't see tongue or any of the crazy parts on the menu  but I will try to ask them next time. Remember that these are served with just raw onions and cilantro. Nothing fancy  just tortilla  meat  and 2 toppings.  I am not a fan of the horchata though! It just wasn't for me. Too chalky and spicy  in the sense of spices like cinnamon.  Will be back  probably tomorrow :)\"\n",
      "\n",
      "my favorite byob spot at the moment! came here twice already and i am in love with their tacos! most recent visit  we got the chorizo  al pastor  tinga  and the cow tongue tacos and they were all very good! though  i have the say the chorizo and al pastor were probably my favorite.  All the food came at the speed of lightening and they're all very meaty! we also got the Alambre  which is the diced steak with peppers and onion with cheese on top! it is super flavorful and really hit the spot! it will definitely be a staple choice for when i come to veracruzana!    PS. making a reservation beforehand is highly recommended!\n",
      "Told them I had a food allergy  served me something that had wheat. They told me they didn't know  but that's their job. I got sick  and they wouldn't even comp what they gave me. Pretty inexcusable. Also  the food sucks.  All that aside  our waitress felt so bad she comped me with her own money. She was a sweetheart  it was the cook and the manager's fault.\n",
      "\n",
      "A variety of food was ordered for the office in honor of first Friday lunch. The absolute highlight  the whole reason I am writing this review  is to shine spotlight on the Cuban chicken sandwich. Just imagine a thin crispy breaded cutlet on Cuban bread topped with cheese  avocado  jalapeño  lettuce  tomato  onion and mayo pressed to perfection. Not at all what I was expecting from a Mexican themed lunch but beyond pleased that I snatched one of these up before they were gone. I will make a point to eat here again!\n",
      "Good and cheap eats  must try the red sauce enchiladas best I have had  in the city very traditional  clean and home made! Their flautas which are rolled fried little taquitos are like crack! Also the burritos delicious and huge!\n",
      "I love it here. It'd be hard to find a better place in the city. Three tacos for 6 bux. Mix and match if you wish.  Tacos al pastor (pineapple-y pork) are great. Steak  too. And try the stuffed (with cheese) jalepeno taco. Lots of meat on 2 corn tortillas. What a deal.   Take out or eat in.\n",
      "Great place for Mexican food! Authentic  cheap  and generous portions. I've had their burritos  fajitas  and tacos. The guacamole is incredible!\n",
      "Best. Cannolis. Ever.    I love all of their cannolis but their marscapone is my favorite. Their Italian cookies are delicious. The apple walnut  tart was good. I absolutely love this bakery.\n",
      "Isgro's is the best!  Their cannoli are so good and always freshly filled.  I've tried a number of cookies and other pastries from this bakery and every one is out of this world good!!  The cakes are fantastic as well  and they have so many unique flavors styles that you can always find something to please anyone!  Any time you need to feed that sweet tooth Isgro's is the way to go!\n",
      "I usually love Isgros but I'm not sure what happened. I received my favorite cake  Italian cream pie  for my birthday cake. The taste just wasn't there. It was missing the chocolate layer and nuts. The cake was also like mush. As soon as you cut it  the whole thing crumbled. For $40  the cake should taste good. I'm so disappointed. I wait all year for this cake and now I'm not sure I'll be waiting again.\n",
      "Craving some Italian dessert. I need to eat some good cannoli and lobster tail. I walked all the way to Italian market and got in this small bakery.  Need to warn you  the ladies who worked there  they must be super busy with non stop customers. They don't want to be bothered so do not ask any question...  My cannoli... Ok.. Wasn't bad. But not as good as the one at Veniero's in NYC but definitely better than the Bruno's or petitio's. Lobster tail was ok. Pastries were well baked but their custard cream was just ok. I'm general their fillings were nothing special to me. I would never crave their filling though.   Unexpected jackpot was carrot cake. Not too sweet but their cream cheese icing was amazing. Now I am craving their carrot cake though.   If the ladies there were little nicer  at least answer your questions w/o being annoyed I would give them 4 star because of their carrot cake.\n",
      "My last two birthday cakes have been from Isgro's.  This year  tiramisu cake.  The year before  cannoli cake.  Seriously  how insanely genius is that.  Cannoli cake!  And I can't even tell you how good they tasted.  How much time I spend thinking of them all the rest of the year..  But in the mean time   there are the actual cannoli.  Amazing  crispy  creamy  wonderful  with a sprinkling of powdered sugar goodness.  These will bring you back from the edge.   This is not even to mention all the cookies and pastries and miniature tarts and cakes- from the traditional Italian to the plain everyday works of art.   I've literally never had anything bad from here.  There were things I might have loved slightly less than others  but only slightly.  Indeed  I have loved them all.  Sfogliatella  Italian Rum Cake Squares  I could go on  but I won't  just this once. This shop is adorable and clean.. such a cute little storefront.  The ladies are always nice and helpful.  Their website claims that their famous customers have included both Paul Newman AND Frank Sinatra.  There is no more win than that. I also want to say that they have a picture of a Pope on the wall  but I may be imagining that in my sugar-fiending frenzy.   It can get a little crowded and if you're a glutton like me  also a little pricey-  But these sweets are for special occasions and therefore worth every penny (And really  where else are you going to go?).  And remember  there is no shame in buying yourself cake.\n",
      "MOVES FAST?!?!? i would have liked to been in the line that moved fast. The ONLY thing i get here is the tirimisu  it's actually the only place i like it from. I stood in line for 2 hours on xmas eve  by no means did it move FAST. for every one person on the sidewalk there were 4 more crammed into the store. It was complete chaos and you couldn't even breath in there. Listen  do yourself a favor  go in the summer and even better yet  go a few blocks further and go to Potito's for your cannoli  you'll be better served and leave with some money in your pocket!\n",
      "For a place that's been around so long  they act like inept amateurs. Avoid them at all costs  unless you like taking risks.   Isgro's made what was apparently a delicious and beautiful cake for my wedding. Unfortunately  I only got one bite  and the cake topper that we froze got ruined. So a little over a year later  for my birthday  my wife and I decided to order a replica of the cake topper as my birthday cake. We order it on a Sunday to be picked up the following Saturday morning - the day we're moving out of South Philly. I show up exactly at 9  when I'd agreed to pick it up. Oops  they forgot. \\Please come back tomorrow mid-day \\\" they say.   So I show up the next day  patiently taking a special trip back to the city on my birthday itself  in the middle of a hectic move. I stand in a 25-minute line and when they finally call my number  they tell me that they forgot again. I did NOT have time this weekend to head over there twice  and it really helped to ruin what was already a frustrating and tiring birthday weekend.  Just the icing on a really bad cake  so to speak.  By all means  if you like taking risks with special orders  go to Isgro's. Roll the dice  see if they bother remembering you.  If they forget  you can roll the dice AGAIN and see if they forget you twice. Apparently  they have more important things to do than take your money and make cakes and pastries.\"\n",
      "I had the misfortune of trying the cannoli here.   The cannolo was terrible!  It had an artifically flavoured filling with the texture of canned pudding instead of genuine ricotta  which is what good cannoli ought to be filled with. Pastry part was okay  with a crispy texture.  The cannolo was also surprisingly expensive  direly overpriced for the quality.   If you like your cannoli tasting like they came out of a supermarket can of pudding  this is the place for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just had the best zeppoli from here! Made with marscapone rather than ricotta.It was sinful! Their cannoli and butter cookies are better than any other South Philadelphia bakery.And all my birthday cakes come from here. The pound cake is a must! My only complaint is that the lines are huge on weekends anymore. And forget about holidays.\n",
      "Absolutely loved this charming restaurant. The atmosphere was welcoming and the food was amazing.   We had fried green tomatoes  the burger with sweet potato fries and the milk and cookies dessert. All of which were amazing.\n",
      "I've been twice and both times with other foodie folks. Burgers were great  drinks strong. The rest of the meals were average in prep and taste  but the outstanding service makes it a nice place to be.\n",
      "If you're in the mood for southern comfort for brunch  please come here. The chicken and waffles & shrimp and grits was perfection. The waffles were made just right and home fries is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Saltiness of the chicken is balanced out with the amount of syrup. The pouched egg just gives it extra texture. Shrimp and grits has the best combination of the jalapeño cheese sauce and spicy tomato sauce. The mash potato in the middle goes perfectly with the two sauces. Excellent meal :) Not to mention how friendly the staff were! Def coming back!\n",
      "This place is awesome. Great ambiance  great food  excellent staff. I would definitely recommend. If you go for brunch  get the Shrimp & Grits. You will not be sorry!\n",
      "I like what Rex 1516 is trying to pull off  but after dining there twice I just didn't have a good experience.  The decor is nice  but the food was inconsistent and overpriced.  The experience is casual yet pretentious  making me feel like the restaurant doesn't know what it wants to be  with servers pretty much ignoring you for long stretches of time.  The food has to be way better for that.  The $11 scallop appetizer nets you two  that's right TWO scallops on a giant plate with some okay looking greens.  Maybe I just don't understand scallops  but we didn't see/taste anything special there.  The vegetarian meatloaf felt like something you could get out of the frozen section of the supermarket  to be awfully blunt.  The chicken was good  but not what you'd expect for the price (again).  The friend I dined with wasn't raving about the pork loin either.    The best part of our first visit was the crawfish pot pie  but when we returned a second time we got two and they were not as good and mine tasted somewhat sour.  Disappointing.  Lower some of the prices and the pretentiousness level and you've got a good place to go  but as is  I won't be returning.\n",
      "The mushroom bucatini is the best pasta dish I've had in philly! unbelievable taste!  probably not cooked by humans. Alien creation. Yummmmmm!! Our server was very funny and friendly. His recommendations were great! Inexpensive  beer  wine selection\n",
      "This is one of my favorite places in the entire city! We have a great time each and every time we go. Heather and Lou always make us feel welcomed! The food is outrageous  from the mac and cheese with pulled pork  to every single special they serve ( go with the specials!) brunch is fantastic  drinks are delicious. Truly no complaints! Tuesday night is a burger  shot  and beer for $15.00  really can't beat that and Rex won best burger this year. The cookies and milk are unlike anything I've ever had  also a must! Love Rex!\n",
      "Holy crap  this is hands down one of the greatest burgers I've ever eaten!!!!   I came here on a last minute whim in the mood for a burger and I am literally speechless...I don't quite have the words to describe this meal other than PERFECTION!!!  Heaven in my mouth pretty much sums it up.  Please do yourself the favor and come try this place.  PS  this is my first Yelp review ever written!!!\n",
      "Went here on a desolate weeknight and experienced: 1. poorly executed and overpriced food  2. bad service and long wait for food  3. freezing temperatures!  Literally  there was no one else there and we waited 30 minutes for appetizers.  No update from waitress on why our food was taking so long  no inquiries as to how we were doing (hungry!).  We didn't even get any bread while we were waiting!  The food was conceptually interesting but poorly executed.  I mean seriously - $7 for a rubbery Scotch egg?  The mussels were mediocre at best and served with 2 measly slivers of toasted bread  the menu says it is served with sweet potato fries but they were more like over-fried tiny slivers of garnish.  The beignet was too doughy and reminded me too much of Hot Pockets ... actually that's an insult to Hot Pockets  because I think they are crisper than Rex's beignets if you use the aluminum sleeve when you microwave them.  The crawfish pot pie had decent flavors but the pastry should have been flakier.  The fig bruschetta has balanced flavors  but I one of my poached figs was dry and chewy.  Lastly  THERE WAS NO HEAT ON A CHILLY NOVEMBER NIGHT BECAUSE IT FELT LIKE IT WAS 50 DEGREES IN THERE!  I guess the servers didn't notice because they weren't really in the dining area at all.  Really  al fresco dining is not my thing at this time of the year and all I could think about was getting the bill so I could leave and get warm again.\n",
      "The only caveat I can give is that service was a bit slow. This place is sick.  The decor is kind of extra  the combination of being a super narrow space with all the random excess makes it feel like a very cozy 1700s Spanish Imperial coatroom. I'm pretty sure leather covered tables is incredibly excessive  but whatever floats your boat.   Came in on a Sunday around 2pm  reasonable crowd inside but not terribly packed. We were seated promptly but it took a while for the waitstaff to get around to us. However  once they did  they were nothing less than fantastic. I asked for a beer recommendation and they brought out a small sample for me to try.   My friend and I both got the house burger. It's probably the 2nd best burger I've ever had in my life (behind Blacow in Tokyo if you ever get the chance) and goddamn it is amazing. It's thick and satisfying. The buns were warm and soft and slightly grilled (extra as fuck  I'm pretty sure that made no discernible difference in taste  but extra is fine when it comes to the food). The pimento cheese adds a serious kick to it and every time you bite into the egg  a warm  salty  drip of egg flavor just hits you. It's fucking fantastic. The lettuce is kind of overpowered by everything else that's going on  but that's not really a knock against it.  It also came with an order of fries  which were pretty good I think  but honestly after that burger nothing really mattered. Would definitely come back.\n",
      "I've had plenty of good pizza  bad pizza  and overpriced pizza. Santucci's at 10th & Christian makes good pizza. The prices are fair - nothing outrageous. The toppings I've had are great  but the base pie (tomato  mozz  or white mozz) is just as satisfying. They have a great location and should take advantage of that by continuing to produce a quality product (and correcting any service shortcomings that people here on Yelp have mentioned). While I applaud any business for improving a neighborhood  some South Philly pizzerias are just not in good neighborhoods and anyone from north of South Philly is not going to want to be there.\n",
      "Despite poor service at last visit  I've been back again for take out several times because  frankly  their pizza is so good.  Take out was timely and delicious.  I've heard service has improved and I am working up the courage to return to dine in.  Stay tuned.\n",
      "It's pizza and movie night at our place every Saturday  and Santucci's has become a family favorite -- we love their pizza!  Coming from Chicago where we were big fans of Lou Manalti's  we really like the thicker crust Santucci's offers.  Great taste and the ingredients (sauce  cheese  bread) feel legitimate authentic.  We get delivery  so I can't say anything about the restaurant dining experience.\n",
      "Stopped in here on a sunny Saturday with my man for some lunch.  Obvi the line at Sabrina's was out the door.  We settled on a medium veggie lovers pizza and a garden salad.  I have to say  the prices here are amazeballs.  Lots of pizza for not a lot of dough.  The salad was also very large.  I should have got the dressing on the side  or light on the dressing  cause it was pretty doused.  The pizza was just okay  unfortunately.  The spinach and broccoli rabe were fully loaded  which made the pizza a bit watery (think of all that water that comes out of spinach when you cook it...).  I thought the cheese was a bit flavorless  too.  I'm bummed I didn't like the pizza here more.  But  of course  how you like your pie is so personal.\n",
      "Website says they deliver to all of Center City  however they won't go above Market Street.... not very honest\n",
      "AWFUL service  mediocre pizza - at best. We were so excited to finally have the Santuccis open  so we ordered pizza at 6PM on a Sunday night. Clearly stated chicken and spinach  and 30 minutes later got green pepper and spinach. Some of the green peppers still had the little pieces of the sticker from the store on them. EW. Called to get the right pizza and an hour and a half later we finally got the right pizza. It was cold. Can't figure that out since the lady on the phone said it was coming straight from the oven. The delivery guy  also apparently the Manager  even had the balls to ask for the original pizza back  and said he wouldn't charge us the difference in price for the chicken.... Um... wasn't it THEIR fault!?! Will never be ordering from here again.\n",
      "Best pizza ever!!! Its great that they deliver to all of South Philly. Blake  who answered the phone  was really helpful with my special requests. Kirby  our delivery driver was right on time  and helped me carry my pizza upstairs  because I had a big order. Its really outstanding employees like this  that make this place a south philly gem!\n",
      "Santucci's serves one of my favorite pizzas in Philadelphia.  The crust is perfection and unlike any other crust in the city. I love the reverse topping style-- baking the cheese into the crust first is really tasty. Then the sauce is added and it is baked again. I loved it. My husband finds the sauce to be a bit salty for his taste  but I've found that it varies and since the sauce is applied conservatively  the saltiness does not really bother me.  Great job Santucci's and welcome to my neighborhood!\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a similar experience to Elise S. -- I called in an order  they told me 20 minutes.  I came 20 minutes later and then waited 30 more minutes for my order.  Sat awkwardly.   To boot  I had only ordered 2 sandwiches.  One was soggy  the other real just bland tasting.  Not worth a 50 minute wait.  Also no one apologized or even talked to me as I waited.  Just talked on their phones.  Not going back.\n",
      "Sure  if you don't know good Indian food and you automatically love any vegetarian/ gluten free spot you come across  then it makes sense that you'd give this place anything above 2 stars.   I've been here twice (once was enough  second time was against my will) and I've tried at least six or seven things off of the menu. Only one of them was any good  the rest was made really poorly and prepared strange overall-- just read the ingredients on the menu and you'll see what I mean.  Once one of the wraps was just plain offensive and my friend couldn't get past two bites. I tried it too and thought it was pretty disgusting. Finally we sent it back because it was just plain awful and ice cold. Can't believe they would even serve it. I was surprised that they offered to serve something else in its place for free  but after having something so bad  we had pretty much lost our appetites and declined.   The service is pretty awful as far as I've seen. They always seem to be in a terrible mood as if they hate talking to you. They can't even fake smiles or happiness for some unknown reason. It puts a sour twist on the already bland and sub-par experience.  The place itself seems super sterile and clean which is good but leaves the room smelling like soap and chemicals. They could either lighten up on the disinfectant or at least use air fresheners. The seating is fine for a shack-type spot  nothing impressive here either.  Drinks are overpriced.   I hate going here and will avoid it at all costs. There's absolutely nothing that appeals to me about this place and I have never once actually enjoyed my meal here. There are other spots in the city to get Indian food although none of them are all that great and have similarly rude attitudes as far as I've seen. I don't like to make sweeping generalizations but you can try them for yourself and you'll see what I mean.  Friends who try to suggest this place for dinner are now ex-friends.\n",
      "Authentic North Indian food  great taste and made fresh compared to the other indian buffet places!\n",
      "I got a mango lassi and a chicken dosa with goat cheese  spinach  and portabella mushrooms. Thankfully for me  it wasn't spicy (gastrointestinal issues make it difficult for me to consume a lot of Indian spices) and the chicken was pretty flavorful. Unfortunately the coconut chutney was missing something - maybe a chai-ish spice combination? It didn't have a lot of flavor.  The mango lassi was a bit thicker than I was expecting  but I'm not super-well acquainted with Lassi. It was most definitely delicious - plenty of mango flavor!  The staff were pretty friendly - I asked if they made stuff like gulab jamun or barfi/burfi and the latter is apparently too difficult to make there  but they have made gulab jamun in the past. The desserts are switched out on something like a bi-weekly basis.  Also the dosa came with some kind of soup. It made a good dip for the dosa in the parts where there wasn't any filling (which was about two-thirds of it  for better or worse.\n",
      "Some really nice food in downtown philly. Worth checking it out! We had the Mysore dosa and paneer kathi roll. Both of them flavorful  the roll was a little oily. The chutney was watery. Other than  the place has decent options and the service is quick.\n",
      "I went back and I am sitting here in the afterglow of a bowl of sambar. It was 93 cents well spent.  I ordered:  - Dosa with veggie chicken  spinach and roasted onion  - Idli   - Sambar  - Curry Chutney  - Mango Chutney  - Masala Chai  If you'll recall  a dosa is a rice-flour crepe  and an idli is a savory rice-flour cake. Sambar is a stew/gravy made from lentils  tomatoes  tamarind  hot pepper  and various spices and vegetables. An excellent accompaniment to any Indian meal  sambar can be poured on dosa  idli  rice  or just about anything.  The spinach  onion  and veggie chicken did a really nice job of adding body to a dosa as a meal. I split an order of idli with my coworker. Both the dosa and idli dipped in mango chutney  curry chutney  or sambar were  savory  spicy  and quite tasty. The sambar is solid  especially at the price point of 93 cents. Its kick leaves you with a gentle spicy glow.   The masala chai was as expected.   So go grab a dosa  idli  or samosa and drop an extra buck on the sambar. You'll be glad you did.\n",
      "We stopped in here to take a food break from watching the 2017 mummers' parade. The place was fairly quiet and the staff was helpful and friendly. I love the dosas here - tasty  light  crisp. Both the chutney and sambar that their served with were delicious. I'm a big fan of the spicy potato filling  great on a crisp January day. This is one of my long time favorite go-to value restaurants in Center City  give it a try!\n",
      "First time trying  PCC and it was a good experience. I tried the Chicken Tika Masala which was really flavorful and not too spicy with good amounts  of chicken. The rice was very good with the sauce. I would have liked a little more salad. My Mango Lasi was good also  My daughter got a Kati Roll which she liked. The fries were surprisingly good.   The inside was really pleasant and clean and hip. Sort of a fast food  good quality Indian restaurant. Not a bad choice for lunch or a quick meal plus Federal Doughnuts is right next door!\n",
      "Blah. The concept is great and dosas are naturally gluten free  so I was all for Philadelphia Chutney opening here. I've tried similarly named Hampton Chutney in NYC and was so happy to finally eat a \\sandwich\\\" again.  Unfortunately  Philadelphia Chutney did not measure up. First  the taste of the dosa was a little overwhelming. While Hampton Chutney's dosas are a lot lighter and very subtle  these dosas tasted very sour and were too thick to have a good crisp texture. My main problem  though  was with the fillings. When you're dealing with veggies  you gotta step up the flavor. There was certainly spice  but something (salt maybe?) was lacking to balance out the flavors. The masala potatoes sounded good  but it was basically yellow mush that had zero flavor. The roasted onions were lost in the mound of potatoes  as was the paneer I was looking forward to.  The worst part was the cilantro chutney. It was HORRIBLE. It had this weird grainy texture and sort of gray in color- definitely not fresh. And a really bad coconut-like aftertaste.  I would consider returning in the future  but for now I'll stick to my trips to NYC for dosas.\"\n",
      "Excellent fast food  Indian style. The dosa's were paper thin and wonderfully greaseless-quite a trick! The chutneys were also excellent and tasty. This place is about 100 feet from my hotel  so I suspect I'll end up eating here a lot.\n",
      "You've got to get a dose of.... Philadelphia Chutney Company's dosas!    ...And their sambar  idli  lassis  and chutneys!!!  Having fallen in love with New York's \\Hampton Chutney Company\\\" (though not with their prices or massive crowds)  I've been longing for a local place offering delicious and quick South Indian cuisine and my wish has come true!!  Philadelphia Chutney Company is just what this area of center city needed--the food is fresh  tasty  and special and the venue is comfortable with no frills or attitude.  The prices are reasonable and the service is great!  I highly recommend the mango  coconut and cilantro chutneys--and just about any dosa will be a good choice!  And make sure to get a lassi!  For a tastebud adventure that will leave you feeling very satisfied  get thee to the Philadelphia Chutney Company!\"\n",
      "BabyBlues has never failed to please me! It is always so yummy and the service is great as everyone is super friendly and cool! The ribs are hard to beat  and the banana pudding is unreal. Definitely recommended!!\n",
      "Baby Blues is not a bad place at all. It's pretty affordable and the food is decent. I really enjoy the catfish sandwich and the collard greens. I'm not a fan of the mac and cheese (they use bleu cheese which gives it a weird flavor  but some people like it.). There service is pretty good there too.\n",
      "So...I ordered food from Baby Blues while working an evening shift.  I was super excited to get my food since most of the reviews rave about how good it tastes.  Well...it never came.  I ordered at 6:43 and now it is 8:59.  I called the restaurant  I called GrubHub and still no food.  Can't comment on the food itself cuz I didn't get to enjoy it.\n",
      "Fantastic food at this place. This was our first time but well definitely be back!  Service was phenomenal  they're recommendations were spot on (we had the half bbq chicken with Mac and cheese and creamed spinach)  it was clean  cool and fun. Outdoor seating looked perfect as well!   Can't wait to come back and try more from the menu!\n",
      "Great everything. I tend to do the greens and chicken. But everything from the ribs down is great. Even the corn bread is legit actual corn bread. In addition  there are a bunch of different hot sauce   BBQ sauces available. The xxx sauce is no joke. Messy and delicious.\n",
      "I was wavering between one and two stars  but settled on two because the pulled pork wasn't bad and I liked the pecan pie. I had dinner with 6 people. We were seated immediately and the waitress took our drink order right away. We got our drinks and she took our order. Then the waiting began....our food arrived about 40 minutes later. I ordered the three meat platter - pulled pork  brisket and blackened catfish. My sides were fried okra and mashed potatoes. Pulled pork was moist and flavorful. My brisket was beyond fatty and basically inedible. The catfish was flavorless. My sides were cold and nothing to write home about. My husband's mac-n-cheese (also cold) was underwhelming. Everything seemed to need salt (which we had to ask for as there was none on the table). The corn bread was funky and not in a good way. After we got our food our waitress all but disappeared. We had to flag someone down to get us water. The space is pretty tight in there and I ended up getting elbowed in the head by one of the waitstaff  who exclaimed \\don't worry  it was just my elbow\\\" as he rushed past. It was just his elbow as opposed to what? A greasy  dirty plate? No idea. In sum  it's expensive and the food is mediocre. I was also unimpressed by the portions  not that I was dying to eat more of anything  mind you. We won't be back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately when I walked in I enjoyed the scene  a vintage BBQ spot! The place looks way bigger inside than it does from the outside. At first I wasn't sure where to go to be seated  there are signs  but the final sign is a bit hard to find. I'm not sure if they do take out but I would NOT recommend coming here on your lunch break  once I ordered it took 40 minutes to get my food (you can determine if that's long or not) but once I got my food I enjoyed every part of it. I got the yard bird (white meat) and it was juicy which is hard to do.  Also  if your looking to have lunch and read a book or catch up on some work  THIS IS NOT THE PLACE  though this can be great to catch up with a friend or have a meeting you don't mind being public because it's loud yet chill. The prices are also extremely reasonable!   I would definitely come back but not during my lunch again!\n",
      "Absolutely delicious! Had the pulled pork platter with Mac and cheese and the blues corn. My boyfriend had the brisket sandwich with pork and beans.   Excellent food and service. Great ambiance. Just a heads up  it gets busy during peak hours. Will definitely be back.\n",
      "Very good BBQ- not the southern style more commonly known around the country  but it's own style of delicious food. The dry rub ribs and sweet potatoes fries are amazing as is the BBQ sauce. The sauce has a distinctly fruity flavor missing in other sauces I've tasted  making it quite distinctive and delicious. The collards are also unexpectedly good for a BBQ restaurant in the heart of Philly!\n",
      "Been here for happy hour twice. Great food and drinks both times. Bummed they took the spinach chaat off the happy hour menu. A must have for each visit. The ribs and mussels are good apps as well. The HH cocktails  old fashioned and some cucumber cocktail were good and refreshing.  Definitely worth stopping by.\n",
      "So excited to have a good Indian restaurant with nice ambiance. Service was great  cocktails were amazing and food is delicious.  The only drawback was the lighting (too bright) and the height off booth seating.  Inder is the GM and very attentive.  Loved that the waitstaff had perfect pronunciation of dish names.\n",
      "We picked this place because of the happy hour only to find out that if you're sitting at a table than it doesn't include you. Bummer! We got vindaloo it was so exceedingly delicious. The meat just falls off the bone. The best I've ever had.  -The saag paneer/ palaak panner was so very delicious. Lots of paneer. Yum. - The Kashmiri naan was insanely delicious. We all loved out food.  I wouldn't order the chai again. Not sure if it was a mix or if they used skim milk. No cardamom? Something off.  -- Still the food was great.  -My friends loved their gulab jamun.  The decor is true desi modern art... it was extraordinary.  Really loved the colors and Hindi script and huge size.  Great atmosphere.  Lots of waiters at hand to serve you. We were very well looked after and glasses of water were topped off often. Great great great service.  I wish the music was more desi style but ... its your style. I can dig that \n",
      "Tried Veda with the family over the holidays  and were amazed.  Not super familiar with Indian food  so let the Manager make some suggestions.  Everything was delicious  and we struggled to pick a favorite.  Crispy spinach a must  and the Veda Mule is officially my new favorite cocktail.  Will definitely be back...\n",
      "Great space! Great time! Walking into an Indian bistro is usually intimidating as a Caucasian male but Veda.. WOW  what an amazing experience! Awesome decor followed by an awesome atmosphere blended a traditional Indian restaurant with a progressive and upbeat downtown Philly eatery. I will be going back - insider tip: try the Tandoori chicken on the appetizer list. To die for.\n",
      "Food is awesome but lighting sucks. They need to dim the lights  Service was great as were the drinks\n",
      "I have to say this is the best happy hour that I've been to in Philadelphia. The prices and food are phenomenal in every aspect.  Let's start with the walk-in. It absolutely looks like you're in somebody's house with the bookshelves and the alcohol. The whole feel is very welcoming. If you look at the seating there's a surprisingly large amount of it. Go to the bar for happy hour and you'll see even the bar has lots of seating. Contrast this with a small place like Tinto. The whole atmosphere just comes together well. I personally appreciated the straws decorated in a black and white swirl. It looked very elegant. And of note the bartenders were very pleasant and attentive. They're definitely worth a nice tip.  Now  on to the food. I think most items on the happy hour menu (which I've attached in a photo) are $5. I would definitely go for the Calcutta ribs because they're delicious and there's three of them and it's $5! The naan with goat cheese is also delicious with a nice serving and that is also pictured. And for dessert I would suggest the rice pudding like I always do at Indian restaurants because it was phenomenal.  Go here and then come back for more. I definitely plan to!\n",

      "Oh Greek Lady. I've probably had it over 40 times  despite not enjoying it that much  purely due to Penn 'free food' events. Sigh. The only thing I've liked here has been the Greek salad in store.   The gyros are really nothing special here  they're not especially terrible but nearly all of them (despite different meats  flavor combinations  etc) taste the same. Isn't it a problem when multiple people cannot tell what they are eating by the taste and need to look at the label??! (Sadly  I've seen this happen at least 3 times).   Service in store is bad for take out but pretty reasonable if you are eating inside. Delivery is also very hit or miss-when I've ordered it with other people  sometimes you get more than you ordered (one time  we all got fries with gyros) and other times you don't get something you asked for (we ordered grape leaves and got none). Unless you are absolutely desperate (or it's free)  I would avoid Greek Lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had an hour before my next meeting at Upenn and walked by the Greek Lady. On a whim  I turned around and went in. Their menu has the usual beef and cheese steaks  wraps  gyros  souvlaki and Greek appetizers  however  because it was 21F and 21 mph  I opted for their homemade chicken and orzo soup with a side of homemade spanakopita. The soup is hands down the best I've ever had. Big strands of white meat chicken  carrots  onions and orzo  however the chicken broth is what made it spectacular. Seasoned perfectly with the right amount of chicken fat  it is heaven in a bowl.  The spanakopita is absolutely delightful made from fresh homemade fillo dough and filled with wonderful spinach blend. It is so big  I got a to go box.  I will be eating at the restaurant again and again it's so good.\n",
      "Nothing too special about this place. Just your average greek food for an average price. Got the house gyro  which came out to $7.51. You can get a similar but smaller gyro at the halal cart for less than $5. You can see the spits that they carve the meat from though  which is either great or gross  depending on your perspective.\n",
      "Stopped here for dinner with the brother and cousin--pretty decent  but nothing that blew me away.  Fries in the chicken gyro were a nice surprise--even though I'd read about it on Yelp.  Wish there were a neater way of eating the gyro--there's really no good way to eat that thing without making a mess.  Cousin got the chicken platter? looked like quite a bit of food.    Will revisit next time i'm in philly :)\n",
      "Greek Lady! Wooo!  The gyros are good. Love the tzatziki. The salads (~$10) are awesome and generally last me 2-3 meals. Fries and mozzarella sticks are always good  though the sticks are a tad on the expensive side. In fact  if everything on the menu were a dollar or two cheaper  this place would be perfect. This also used to be one of my favorite places to grab a cheesesteak in the city  though this may or may not still be true. Regardless  Greek Lady makes a really good cheesesteak.   The new renovations make the place nice and snazzy  and quite a bit bigger than it used to be.\n",
      "oh greek lady. how i love thee  let me count the ways! you've made it all the way from a food truck to the relatively large storefront you have today! i think i could live off of greek lady salads and mashed potatoes. the grilled chicken is the BEST.\n",
      "Greek lady is an awesome fast food option for gyros and some typical American fast food  but the service with pick up orders is very lacking.  The food at Greek lady isn't out of this world but for the most part it is a great option for a cheeseburger  gyros  or their grilled chicken salad. In terms of bang for your buck  the grilled chicken salad is a pricey $8.50  but you get a significant about of food that can easily become two meals!!   The reason I'm giving Greek lady three stars however centers around the service I've received with pick up orders. On my last four orders  something has gone wrong ranging from getting the wrong order  to getting the wrong dressing  to placing the wrong order in the computer despite repeating the correct order back to me. It is a pretty small thing but now I always check my bag before I leave the store and I would recommend that to anyone else.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you haven't been here yet  there is some TING WONG with you. Ok  I promise that's the last cheap Asian joke I'll make in this review. Speaking of cheap - this place! 4 of us had dinner with leftovers for $14 each!  When I'm sick I get super Asian and all I want is jook (aka congee)- a rice porridge. It's Asia's chicken noodle soup and Ting Wong does it well  with big flavorful chicken pieces. You can tell it's good because almost everyone (Asian) was eating this (and most people looked healthy). I'll have to come back for breakfast when they have the fried dough to dip in it (yep  Chinese people eat rice for breakfast).  We also really enjoyed the roast duck and roast pork and spare ribs. Clearly they do meat well here (just look at all the delicious looking meat hanging in the window). They even have Peking duck! (They have the pillowy mini taco type  not the crepe kind).  Service is not their strong suit  but the food comes out super fast and I appreciate our waitress talking us out of getting the wet chow fun and recommending the dry. What I don't appreciate is having to hunt our waiter down for water and having them offer us forks (what an insult!). They take credit card and are BYOB.'  Ting Wong  you'll be seeing me again  hopefully in full health next time  but definitely also when I'm sick again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best and most reliable food in Chinatown. Perfect roast pork  great wonton soup and amazing ribs. My favorite meal here is breakfast. Can't wait to come back and try the lobster and duck buns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some friends and I went to Ting Wong for a quick bite to eat. I was a little hesitant at first  but now I'm glad we went.   I ordered beef with string beans  which is also served with white rice. For the price ($5)  it was certainly a lot of food! The meat was flavorful and the string beans were crisp. The sauce was yummy. I'll be back to try more dishes!\n",
      "CASH ONLY!!!!! I did pick up. The food was okay. It was all fairly bland  to be honest. It was so cheap though. The best things I had were the duck and roast pork. They actually had GREAT flavor  but the portion was tiny. The rest of the dishes were forgettable and I won't order them again (beef chow fun  lo mein noodles  and sesame chicken)\n",
      "This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Chinatown  where I now live  but I have been coming there way before that... It is no frills  but the food is great  as are the prices! The duck and the soy chicken are my favorites (I order the appetizers without the rice). Their won tons are nice and thin and very good. Great fried rice too. They are also very efficient. Highly recommended.\n"

When I go here  I would usually order the duck and wonton noodle soup but I've had other items on the menu like the pork blood congee and the seafood pan fried noodle. If its your first time here  I would recommend one of the noodle soup. The broth is very light with a little hint of flavor but its recommended that you eat the noodles with a little piece of meat and broth. The saltiness from the meat will balance out the broth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quick and simple place to grab a bite  the service there is straight to the point. The food is always good. I usually order the rice with meat options or one of their delicious soups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love this place! It is my go-to date night spot.  I always get the same thing - chips and salsa trio  cauliflower tacos and the house margarita.   The vibe is lively and fun  the food is great and I've never had a bad time!\n",
      "\n",
      "Very poor female bar tender this is why places go out of business rude and obnoxious.  According to her when asked  \\a restaurant can have poor quality drinks just cause she makes them \\\" wow and too top it all she says that to a customers face    Guy bartender was good and made fresh margaritas unlike the female that poured stale pre mix from a bottle over a glass of ice.  Food quality is very poor too this place is a disaster and is crowded only cause there are very few choices left.  Don't waste your time and money in this place.\"\n",
      "They've done it again. This time they put one of their irresistible Mexican restaurants right in my hood. I'm going to have to figure out how to get my paycheck directly deposited to Taqueria Feliz because surely that's where I'll be spending most of my money.   We went to Taqueria on opening weekend  twice. Everything I had was delicious. The vibe is cool  casual  dark and fun. The menu has many similar items to the ones you'll see at Calaca or Cantina  but they are definitely doing their own unique things as well.   I've had: The nachos (with and without meat) -- bangin' Guac - you can't go wrong with guac The tortilla soup -- a little spicy  a lot affordable Beef tongue tacos - interesting texture  lots of flavor Tacos al pastor - spicy and sweet  can I have some more please?  Fish tacos - lightly fried fish  topped with crunchy radishes  a slice of avocado and some citrus. The cubano - not your average cuban sandwich. So much more!  Sweet plantains - the perfect sweet side to balance everything out Three chili margarita - hands down my favorite margarita of all time.  I look forward to trying the rest of the menu in the coming weeks!\n",
      "Amazing! The carnitas tacos are incredible and my favorite but the brisket tacos take a close second. Nothing beats a good margarita  and Taqueria makes an excellent one. The only bummer is that as of my last visit  the frozen margaritas only came in fruit flavors  not original. All in all  one of my favorite places to eat in Manayunk.\n",
      "Not the most comfortable seats at the bar or at tables  but nachos are some of the best I've ever had.  Lots of cilantro and other fresh ingredients.  For drinks  the chili margarita and a tequila sampler are the way to go!\n",
      "All I can say is you have to come here ...they definitely have the best taco EEEEEVVVERRR...we jus came here out of the blue and I'm glad we did the lamb tacos chicken quesadillas  fish tacos  cheese tacos everything was delicious!!! The service was great also!!\n",
      "Went there last week for brunch. Food was good. Service was exceptional. Our waiter  can't remember his name but he had curly hair  had awesome menu knowledge. He understood how everything was made and prepared. Wasnt pushy or anything and he made great suggestions. Gonna go back just cause he was so great.\n",
      "Wife and I walked in and were seated. Waitress took our drink order and never came back. Another couple came in 10 mins after us and the SAME waitress took their drink order  brought their drinks  AND took their food order... Meanwhile we're still waiting for our drinks to come. This is on a Saturday afternoon  so it wasn't like she was very busy. Immediately left this place and will not be coming back. Very disrespectful service.\n",
      "I am not an indian food type of person but this place lives up to the hype. When you go  just let Hassan make something for you  don't try and overwhelm yourself with the different options. Make sure to get a chaat and a lassi as the two really complement one another.\n",
      "Amazing place for lassi and chaat. The chaat is elegantly presented and tastes like traditional Karachi chaat. However  the chaat isn't as nearly as good as the lassi. It is soft and creamy and sweetened beautifully. Will be coming back for sure next time I'm in the area.\n",
      "A must go-to place if you're in University City. This place's chaat and lassi are to die for. It tastes fresh and refreshing  and will fill you up. My recommendation for chaat: go for the mild  even if you like really spicy food. It's not because it's super spicy (it still has a kick though) but because the balance of flavors is better with the mild chaat. The spicy chaat  the spiciness overpowers the rest of the goodies and it gets a bit too saucy for me. As for lassis  I've had the mango  rose  and mint - all I would recommend.\n",
      "First word! Amazing... The owner 'Hasan' is an artist. My husband had a bad cold but wanted to try cafe's lassi... Hasan made sure my husband not only enjoys the Lassi but also catered his sore throat with a medicinal combination. It tasted amazing. I wanted a spicy Chaat... Its been ages I had such a perfect chaat... Spice  taste and innovation all came together. Must say  have never had such a chaat even in India.  I wish we had one in Milwaukee. We will make more trips to Philli again to eat in ur cafe  Hasan Saab! :)\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been to Desi Chaat a lot and wanted to try another place  so I went down the street to Mood Cafe.  There is one guy behind the counter who spent a while asking me what sorts of food I liked and what spice I can handle.  I asked him to explain all of the ingredients and he went through them one by one.  It was very informative and interesting  and I appreciated his excitement and knowledge about the different flavors and combinations.  We eventually decided on the crazy chaat  a blend of a lot of chaats.  I say \\we\\\" decided because he took my feedback - and perhaps my mood - into account.  I would venture to say the chaat was life-changing  but I'm also a huge fan of Indian food and chaat so count that as my bias.  In any event  because of the good vibes of this place and the ridiculously delicious food  I will surely be back.\"\n",
      "I used to live right next to Desi Chaat House and pretty much went there just for the grab-and-go mango lassi. If you're in the area  Mood Cafe is definitely the better out of the two. Depending on how busy they are  they will walk you through what exactly each chaat is (and what chaat is if you've never had it)  and will make recommendations for whether you are craving something spicy  savory  sweet  etc. I've stuck to the lamb and beef chaats  but all of them are pretty tasty. Customer service definitely prevails on this one.\n",
      "I stopped by this place for an after school snack and am going to make it a weekly installment.  The owner was extremely helpful and welcoming and could tell that I didn't have any chaat experience  so he gave me a crash course.  We decided he would make me what he deemed to be a good chaat for \\beginners\\\" and he made me one of the best things I've ever eaten!  The flavors were so unique and balanced and went so well together!  The mango lassi was also delicious.  Definitely come here and try the chaat  even if you are new to it.  This place couldn't be friendlier!\"\n",
      "Just so you know  I now eat a chicken chaat from Mood Cafe at least once a week. They are so amazing and unlike anything I have ever experienced before. I would attempt to describe a chaat as \\Indian Nachos\\\". It is crispy chips  chick peas and potatoes topped with fruit  nuts  sauces  fresh herbs and chicken. The flavor is ADDICTING! :) The samosas and lassis are also fantastic. Thank you Mood Cafe for introducing me to my new favorite food!\"\n",

      "Doma would get 4 stars if not for my reservation hassle.  I called a couple of days prior and got voicemail.  I left a detailed message (name  party size  date  time  etc).  By the next day no one had called me back so I called again and this time was able to make a reservation for 7:30 pm the next day with the hostess.  Or so I thought.  She confirmed my info  explained that if you're late they hold the reservation for 10 minutes blah blah usual stuff.  The next night my friends and I showed up at 7:30pm starving  with wine bottles in hand....but there was no record of my reservation! Great.  The hostess took our name/number and said she'd call when a table opened up.  Good thing Kite & Key is next door because we didn't get that call till almost 9pm.  I was craving Dok Bok Ki and it did not disappoint.  The Korean tacos (with bulgogi) and the agetofu were also delicious. The rolls were solid: no complaints but nothing amazing - although I really liked the crispy sticky rice in the Naked Tuna roll.  It was different than any other roll I've had. For dessert we split the molten lava chocolate cake and the banana tempura thing.  Both were very good but the banana tempura was my favorite.   I'll give Doma another chance but would go mainly for the non-sushi dishes.\n",
      "I'm so glad this place is right a round the corner.  It's so delicious. The fish is fresh  the staff are friendly  and the prices are reasonable.  Did I mention that it's a BYOB?  It is.  The only cons  otherwise they would get a full 5 stars  are that it takes a little bit more time to get your food (not excessively long  but it's well worth the wait)  also the place is very small.  So if you want space to have some privacy  this is not your place.  All in all  this is my new favorite spot for sushi.  Their fish is perfection!\n",
      "Just had their yellowtail belly and albacore sushi. Best sushi in Philly so far imo...pretty much on par  maybe even better  than Sagami in nj.\n",
      "\n",
      "No complaints about our recent visit to Doma. The sushi is very fresh  the ambiance is lovely  the service is top-notch  and the menu is really creative. We had several exciting rolls and hand rolls that we had never heard of before - very unique combinations that were all delicious and satisfying. We brought along a big jug of sake and they heated it up for us as much as we wanted. The prices are completely fair for the high quality of sushi here! It's great to have Doma in the neighborhood.\n",
      "A happy medium of Japanese and Korean.  I got my fix of both sushi and bibimbap.  We arrived 30 minutes earlier than reservations and got seated right away  mind you it was a Saturday night.  The place itself is small your most likely to bump into the next table.  The decor is very chic with the clear chopsticks and clear chairs.  Although  the chopsticks are not useful once your order of bibimbap arrives.  No worries they provide disposable wooden ones.  I'm not sure if the air conditioning in this place is broken or just on low but it was so humid inside.  It made dining a bit uncomfortable.  We ordered the soft shell tempura.  I'm a fan of soft shell anything so this was a hit to me.  I could've ordered a couple more of this dish.  The husband got bulgogi bbq on a stick which he said had nice flavors but portion was small.  We also got the triple spicy tuna roll.  It had a very nice kick to it.  The bibimbap was a bit of a miss.  The flavors was lacking.  It could have used more gochujang sauce.  I'd like to stop by and try the other rolls that sounded amazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm certainly no sushi aficionado and really only enjoy sushi once in a long while but it was very good. Had the tuna club  bibimbap  and naked salmon rolls. Very unique display for each. Love the creativity. Overall  the sushi was not a home run but definitely intense heavy petting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The staff is really friendly   super accommodating and they food is really good and fresh every time . The triple spicy tuna roll is really good!\n",
      "After visiting for brunch this past weekend  it's really challenging to give Fare any less than 5 stars.  Fare is an upscale restaurant in the Fairmount district of Philly  just across from the Eastern State Penitentiary (which is a museum from a former jail that was closed in the early 70s). After learning that Fare closed at 3pm for brunch  we rushed over to see if they would still seat us about 2:50pm - there was no one else in the restaurant at the time (they close from 3-4:30pm to switch and prepare the kitchen from brunch to dinner service).    With smiles  they welcomed us as long as we agreed to order somewhat quickly. That was only the beginning.    Our server  Danielle  truly exceeded our expectations.  She offered exceptional service  while not being overly attentive.  The appetizers and food we ordered were amazing (from the Pikilia of Spreads starter  to the Gyro Platter  the Eggs Benedict  and both the Mixed Greens and Greek Salads with Chicken (and mediterranean spices)). Even the cocktails were delicious and on point.    When one of us couldn't finish our meal  the restaurant offered to hold on to our to-go bag so we could pick it up after we visited the Penitentiary across the street.    Fare really has it together and I would definitely return anytime I'm in Philly.\n",
      "I enjoyed lunch here with my parents. We decided to sit inside because it was a little too hot outside. The ambiance was nice and the restaurant is chic and comfortable inside. The service was just okay. Our waitress was very friendly but we found ourselves waiting too long for simple things such as having our water glasses filled. I ordered the burger and it was quite good. Really juicy and flavorful. My mom had the tuna melt with guacamole  my dad had the fish tacos. Both dishes were fresh and flavorful. I wasn't wowed by anything at Fare but I would return there for lunch. Overall a pleasant experience but not outstanding.\n",
      "I have been here several times and mostly enjoy sitting outside when the weather is nice. I have been here for lunch  dinner  and late night bites. More recently  I have enjoyed the bucket of pumpkin beers for $16. Food-wise  I have had their mussels  truffle fries  tuna melt  ceviche (not a favorite)  kale salad with fried egg (not a favorite) and fried calamari. They have a happy hour but you must sit in the bar. I seriously hate when restaurants do that. I found out recently  they deliver too  which is a pretty cool service.\n",
      "Five stars for the food and two stars for the service. We went here with a party of eight for a birthday.  Our server greeted us but neglected to take our drink order. When we finally did have an opportunity to order drinks they were slow to come out. Other notable service fails - -- we were not offered any bread - as a rule I think that restaurants that charge over twenty dollars for entrees should have some type of bread offering. After our server took our order he disappeared and did not check on us. We told him one of our friends was having a birthday and clearly identified who but a desert with a candle came out and was given to the wrong girl. Other notable fails - out of the Pumpkin Creme Brûlée even though three people at our table wanted to order it. My friend's chair broke while she was sitting on it (the back fell off and she had to reattach it)  Now for the highlights - everything that came out of the kitchen was presented beautifully and tasted wonderful. We tried the salmon  the squash soup  the beet salad  and the fig creme brûlée. Other friends had the strip steak the bison burger and a flatbread.  A plus for food - -- staff just needs a bit more training and or a bit more incentive to get the job done right.  As a side bar a 20% gratuity was added to our bill.  I wouldn't have minded this if the service was good...but we already had that conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food serviceable  service awful. I would expect a higher level of interest engagement from a counterperson at Taco Bell.\n",
      "This place is awesome! My wife and I just finished dinner here. The truffle fries are loaded with parmesan cheese and served with a chipolte mayo that is out of this world. The crab cakes are served with a sweet-and-spicey chili sauce that leaves you begging for more. The seafood pasta has more shellfish than the Chesapeake Bay.  If you're ever in the Fairmount area of Philadelphia  you have to check this place out.\n",
      "The food wasn't awful  but not worth the price and the ambiance service did nothing to redeem it. The service was awful- our waitress was just the worst. She tried to embarrass my friend because he asked for bacon instead of ham on his eggs Benedict. Strange choice? Yes. What he wanted? Yes. That's all that should matter. I will say: the fries were bomb.\n",
      "Was in Philadelphia for the Army-Navy Game and the family decided to try Fare for dinner - yep based on YELP. Excellent choice.  We had twelve people in our group. Our server Leyla took excellent care of the group. We came in early so when we left they were getting really busy.  Food was good. We had the Crab cake entrée  flank steak (2) and chicken breast.   Bathrooms very clean.  Only negative some of the food could have been a bit hotter (probably sat for a while waiting for the other foods). But I understand that - big party and hard to time 12 meals.  They are located near the Eastern Penitentiary - very interesting neighborhood. This place is worth a try.\n",
      "I was so excited to visit Fair during my visit to Philadelphia  that I studied the menu tonight before and knew exactly what I was going to order the \\apple ricotta pancakes\\\" they were calling me! Also perhaps a lovely cocktail to go with it. Yet when we stepped inside  instead of a friendly \\\"hello\\\" as you get in most establishments we were greeted with a nonchalant \\\"may I help you?\\\"  Ok  fine whatever  the hostess did say she was \\\"on break\\\" .  Then as we were hesitantly taken to our outside table where we were then ignored. A couple that came right after us were greeted warmly   the server went to them first and took their order . Suffice to say we left and went across the street to another establishment.  I probably will never eat apple ricotta pancakes ever again  not cool!\"\n",
      "After a brief visit to the Mummers Parade  the guy and I stopped by Devils Den while walking down 11th Street. It was my first time there. We were immediately seated and walked by a nice  warm fireplace. Our table was by the bar and the stools were high. I don't mind this  it wasn't too crowded but fairly busy. There is another room with more tables. They had the Mummers on TV.  Viewing the drinks menu  I was glad to see they had $10 flights and I chose the Import flight. They have a very diverse beer menu as a lot of the other reviews have mentioned. We chose mussels. He had the mussels over pasta and I ordered the mussels Diablo which was spicy but not overly so. It came with fries  bread and dipping sauce. The food was very good but I thought the fries were a little soft.   The service was great. Our waiter was friendly and joked around with us. Apologized for the wait on receiving our check. The wait for drinks and food wasn't long especially for being very busy. I didn't see the bathroom but I heard it was horrible.   Overall  I would like to visit again  especially for the flights and they look like they have a really great brunch.\n",
      "[8/28/08 update] Craig LaBan just gave the Den one Bell. Ouch. His criticisms were accurate though. While the beer selection  service  atmosphere etc are all great  they just can't figure out the food. We recently got a crabcake napolean  and my wife said it was amazing  and I'm sticking with the thai mussels  but I've given up on getting a good burger. It's too inconsistent  and always a bit of a letdown compared with a monk's or royal tavern burger. I REALLY want the Den to find some good dishes and do them right every time  it just hasn't happened yet.  [4/2/08 update] The Devil's Den opened last night  so a bunch of neighbor/friends headed over to check it out. It's got the makings of something really good  but it has a ways to go.   The decor is pretty nice - not divey  but not too showy. Less rustic than the Royal or the POPE. I didn't see any Eagles decorations  but it's still early. The second floor  which is rumored to host 8 beers on tap in addition to the 16 on the first floor  is still under construction. I felt the beer list was a little gimmicky....lots of beers with demonic/satanic names - I would have liked to have seen a wider selection of domestic craft beers over the themed selection. The kitchen had a sprinkler complication so there was no food on opening night. We did get to meet the owners  Scott and Erin  who both seemed courteous and ready to bring their experience running Manayunk's Old Eagle tavern to the Devil's Den.  The draft beer selection was pretty good and reasonably priced. I had several glasses of a strong ale at $5/glass  and there's enough variety of domestics and european beers on tap to keep me interested in returning again and again. One downside was that a friend ordered Heradura on the rocks and it rang up at $15/glass. That's kinda crazy...maybe they only have the most expensive type  but it was a shock when we got the bill.   It was a warm night  so there were several large windows and doors open  which gave the main seating room a nice al fresco feel (if you were close to these openings). The music was not too loud and at times was drowned out completely by the crowd  which is the way I prefer it. I do wonder how summertime noise levels will jibe with the neighbors  who are certainly not foreigners to noise  with the Nam Phuong/Pho 75 restaurant complex and Washington ave so close.  I look forward to seeing how this place fills out  and hope to give it more stars once I try the food and they get their sea legs.\n",
      "Went here last night for happy hour. The happy hour is amazing!!! Wonderful beer selection  and the bartender knew his stuff.  Service was great and I totally dug the atmosphere.  They had a nice fire roaring  massive attack playing and it was just so damn cozy!!!  I do believe I will be a frequent visitor here.\n",
      "Half price Happy Hours!!! Great Bear!! Good Food! Half price Happy Hours!! Half price Happy Hours!!! Half price Happy Hours!!! Half price Happy Hours!!! Half price Happy Hours!!! Half price Happy Hours!!!\n",
      "This place is great! Always a decent crowd I've never seen this place empty! Very good selection of wine and beers. Service is always good as well!   Now for the best part... The food! Sooo good. Must try the famous duck fries! Shredded duck confit over ipa cheese fries!  So good! Also try the mussels they are fabulous! I love the aventinus cream & leeks mussels or the Diablo spicy chipotle mussels and they're served with crusty bread to sop up the goodness and choice of fries or pasta! Flat breads are good as well! Don't pass this place up!\n",
      "I like beer  I drink a lot of different styles of beer  devil's den makes even a knowledgable beer geek feel like a beginner.  Their draft list is always lined with several beers I've never heard of which is awesome.  Their prices are good and their half-off all drafts is the best happy hour in Philly period.\n",
      "Been here twice and my complaint is about service. Yes  they have good beer  and the food I had was tasty enough. I just don't know why it took 40 minutes to come out when we were the only people there. Bartender and server friendliness does not overwhelm  either. I return to the places where I feel welcomed  and the energy is positive and friendly. There's so many bars that out perform  I'd only go back if there was a planned meeting that was not under my control.\n",
      "Wow!!! What a great place.  Among other things we had the Aventinus mussels which were just outstanding!!  They were some of the best mussels I have ever had  and I have had mussels all over the place  including Belgium  Germany and France.  They were plump and super fresh  made in a leek  Aventinus beer  cream  garlic and bacon sauce.   Also had the burger with gorgonzola which was delicious.  The mussels though were amazing   served with fries and delicious garlic bread  really tasty.  Pair it with a great beer selection and you have a perfect combo. We have been twice and service was good both times.   Ambiance is nice  typical neighborhood bar  a bit on the noisy side  but that is to be expected.\n",
      "Based on beer  they get 5 stars. Based on food  2 stars. Not that the food is bad  it is not. It is quite delicious. Its the lack of options. Most of the food is fancy  which  is what the owners want to portray  which is great. But  if you are feeling picky  it seems like the options force you in a certain direction  like it or not.   Haven't been there since the change in chef and the revamp of the menu. That changed last night. 5-7 is Happy Hour  which is 1/2 off drafts. THAT is a great deal. Nothing like drinking superb beers for half the price. Ordered mild wings. The meat literally picks clean from the bone. The sauce is not over powering and sloppy. Flyers game is on  place is busy. Not overly packed like it was Game 5 of the World Series two years ago.   Ordered Aventinus Mussels. Amazingly delicious. I could swim in the broth. Fiance ordered braised pork sandwich. She said it was delicious. Beer was great. Atmosphere was perfect. A definite pro-Flyers crowd that was not obnoxious.   I will go back  as the beer is alluring. I am hoping they can add a few more options to the menu to make it more rounded.\n",
      "Fantastic happy hour  and a lovely location. Sitting outside when it's nice out is fantastic. Great beer selection! The happy hour appetizers are lackluster.  The bartenders are a little weird and grumpy though.  That being said  they did let me still have happy hour prices when I ordered at 6:58 and it ends at 7:00 pm\n",
      "Fado is a great environment. I've only been there for soccer matches  but have had excellent service in most scenarios. Sometimes it's so crowded that the waitress can't even get to your table  but those instances are few (El Classico  St. Patty's  World Cup).  The breakfast food is very good and hearty. Irish coffees are a must first thing in the AM  immediately followed with a nicely poured Guinness.  It's probably the best place to watch soccer in center city.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went here last year after the Color run completely covered in colored corn starch. Despite that  they didn't mind us coming inside to sit at the bar. The bartender was incredibly friendly and even bought us a round for participating in the 5k. I'd reccommend this place for some strong drinks and great bartending.\n",
      "We went here before a concert at The Merriam Theater a few weeks back  and it was great.  We arrived later than we wanted because of traffic  and told the staff we were a bit rushed.  They couldn't have been more helpful  and did everything possible to get us in and out.  The beer and drinks were great  and so was our food.  Will definitely return.\n",
      "Visited last night with my 2 girls before seeing Wicked.  They had fish and chips and chicken and chips and loved it!  I had the black bean burger - not bad.  Would have been better with a chipotle mayo or something like that  but overall good.  My girls devoured a brownie sundae after dinner.  It must have been something - they ate it like it was a last meal.  LOL.  Good service.  Took a little while to get our check  but the place was pretty busy by then - that was the only slight negative  but all in all good food and service.  I would go back!\n",
      "This place sucks. As a vegan  there were hardly an options for me and the staff were not very accommodating. Also  the atmosphere is really terrible. This place is full of douchey suburbanites. I'd recommend Good Dog down the street and stay far away from this joint.\n",
      "The review is strictly based on weekend  late night shenanigans. When looking for a spot to drink  dance  and have a sweaty grand old time  Fado is one of the first spots that come to mind. Based on the crowd on a Saturday night  I'm not alone! Definitely a regular spot for letting loose on the weekends.\n",
      "Went with the family before going to the orchestra. It was OK  server was relatively friendly (but didn't get her name). Food was nothing to get too excited about. I made the mistake of getting Corned Beef and cabbage  corned beef was OK  cabbage was under cooked. We also had the fish & chips and the Irish breakfast. Sausages were fully cooked but too mushy in the middle. Fish & chips was standard American version. I've been on a mission to find a good Irish Coffee. Atleast this one was made properly  with heavy cream sitting on top (as opposed to spray cream that most use). The downside was the strong cinammon mini swirls on the top - they were too overpowering. We got in and out in an hour early Friday evening  so can't complain about that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Went here with my friend and her mother while we were going to see a show in Philly. I was skeptical of the place at first considering we could sit where we wanted and I wasn't sure if our waitress would ever get to us  the place was packed. Surprisingly  our service was friendly and pretty quick! Our dessert did take sometime to come out  but the manager came over to our table and apologized for that. The customer service was great and the food was delicious. The Shepherd's pie melts in your mouth  the rhubarb pie was sweet and crafted perfectly  and even the wrap I had was great! I had a awesome meal and will be back again (regardless of the mass overload by the bar. :D)\n",
      "This Irish Pub is located on 2nd Street between Market and Chestnut. It was once the Money Exchange building. Beautiful high ornate decorated ceilings ~ wood stairs leading up to the balcony tables. Prices weren't bad! Fish and Chips for 3 of us and the hubster ordered Shepard's Pie. His words: \\Rate this pie a 5!\\\"   Although the pie was a 5 the Fish and Chips didn't stack up to that rating. Fries were great ~ while the fish seemed a bit greasy and the coating kept falling off.\"\n",
      "Came here for a vegan dinner and I was totally impressed! Everything from the fancy toast to the amazing dessert was absolutely delicious!   The vegan creme brûlée was hands down the most delicious item! Haven't had that for 18 years - since I've been vegan!   What's crazy is that this is the type of place you wouldn't think had such TREMENDOUS and high quality vegan options!   This was truly five star dining at three star prices!   I can't wait to go back!!\n",
      "My friends will be surprised  to see me eating here at an Irish pub. But when it's restaurant  week and they're  serving vegan food  I gotta get involved. This was amazing. We had an artichoke  appetizer that was rich in garlic and sauce that was excellent over the slice of toast. The salad of fruit and greens (did the chef read my diary?) Was sweet and spicy  but not too much of either. Seiten steaks that tasted more steak than well any steak with a lovely just perfect steak sauce. Best of all for this veggie lover was the grilled potatoes   sweet potaoes  and green beans slathered  in rosemary.\n",
      "For God's sake  if I order an eggs benedict poached that means the yolk should be runny.  My biggest breakfast pet peeve is when the eggs on a benny are overcooked  and P & S twisted that knife.  On another note  they make damn fine bloody marys (Cajun  Wasabi  and regular--oh yeah  that's how I roll).  Good atmosphere  and actually a good spot for late night drinks--lots of eye candy.\n",
      "I've only been here once  but I was so overwhelmed that it was enough to last me a lifetime.    I went with a group of friends on a Saturday night  and it took 5-10 minutes just to get in the door.  Clearly  I expect bars to be crowded  but this was out of control.  The place is so huge  you'd think that people would be spread out and have room to breathe  but that is a terribly wrong assumption.  We managed to wriggle through the suffocating crowd  albeit very slowly  and headed upstairs hoping for a bit of a reprieve.  It didn't come.    I had to practically wrestle my way to the bar  which was about 3 deep at the time.  When I finally got to the front of it  I had taken a few elbows to the head  and forgotten what half of my friends wanted to drink.  Then  the bartender proceeded to ignore me for  not exaggerating here  15 minutes.  She just kept serving everyone around me  and just amazingly never managed to make eye contact with me.  Finally  thinking that I had either passed out or gotten lost  a friend came to rescue me.  Not even 30 seconds after he got to the bar  the bartender (who by this point I thought could be blind or at least lacking peripheral vision) came right over to take his order.  Now  I've heard once or twice about this phenomenon where females don't like other females  but come on!  How are you gonna just totally ignore a customer!?  Terrible!  I guess she thinks she just needs to work \\the goods\\\" for the guys  and fails to realize a chick here and there might need a drink.\"\n",

      "The Plough & Stars is such an institution!  It's a place where locals go  visitors repeat visit  and friends are made!  It's a great place for happy hour  brunch/lunch/dinner  and live music!  Late night it turns into a really fun place to dance (but not clubby) and magically transforms by morning for brunch!  Great for everyone (literally).  They have outside seating for warm days and a wonderful fireplace for those cold nights! Definitely worth visiting and re-visiting!!    Highlights of The Plough: Outdoor seating  Fireplace  cozy atmosphere  drink selections  affordable  parking nearby   John Joe (trust me  you'll get to know John Joe)  the HoJ (delicious any time of day!)  friendly staff  friendly patrons  local spot\n",
      "Sunday evening we  headed down to Spruce Street by the River. After about two minutes of crowds and kids knocking each other into people walking  these two old ladies were sorta done with it and decided we wanted something besides funnel cakes. I was really tempted to try Federal Donuts and Chicken  but it was so beautiful out we decided to walk over to Old City where we came upon TP&TS.  The music from the little Irish quartet enticed us in too. We sat at the bar and had Hoegartden draft and a gin & tonic. Cold fresh beer  good pour on gin and fresh tonic. Happy happy. So far. We were very hesitant about ordering food because no one was eating  and then I noticed Yelp didn't have many food reviews on the place - mostly just loving the beer and nice people that work there. But starving  we went easy and got buffalo chicken fingers  a burger and fries.  So my review is:  the food  even though it was just bar food  was outstanding. Probably the best chicken strips I've had. Crunchy  tender  good sauce. Burger was very good quality  and cooked just the way I like it - and asked for it - well done and dry. (I know. Sorry.)  Crispy fresh fries. Bartender was excellent  and the people in the bar were - even though slightly inebriated - a lot of fun. I'm still working on the name of the gentleman who picked up our tab - Donald...Donnell... charming Irishman (what else would you expect?) Great experience.  Struggled with giving this 4 stars instead of 5  because 5 stars is reserved for truly great places IMO. How about 4-1 2?\n",
      "I didn't know this place turned into a meat market after happy hour time or later in the night.  We went right after work and the crowd was a decent  a lot of working people in suits trying to get their drink on.  But I can see how it could get rowdy as the night goes on and that's my cue to move onto better pastures.  I don't mind noise but I don't have tolerance for obnoxious drunks which I have a feeling it's the kind of place it attracts.\n",
      "this place is as irish as i am. this place is 2 levels of pain on friday and sat nights- it gets crazy crowded like the end scene of crocodile dundee when mick walks across everyone's head. it seems to be really popular w  the early twenty crowd during those nights. not a bad place to grab a drink during the week. never had the food-i've heard brunch is ok.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was excellent.  There were four of is and two had brought food from a different restaurant.  We asked if it was okay to eat all together.  She said no problem.  So cool!  We all ordered bubble tea which were delicious.  Mango was the table favorite.   Our server recommended that we get the Sihracha hand drawn noodle.  We were more than satisfied.  We even got to watch them make our noodles in the back!  I ordered mild and it was spice-ayy.   My only thing was this was one of two highly rated noodle joints in Chinatown.  Food and service were great but the decor sucked.  Looked like a B rated Chinese takeout spot.\n",
      "As you may have probably experienced there are quite a few good choices when it comes to good authentic Asian cuisine in china town Philly. So here I am on a Sunday afternoon searching through my fellow Yelper's opinions and after seeing 4 stars after 4 stars on most restaurants it comes down to the best reviews  so at last we decided on Spice C seeing that it was actually one of the places we haven't tried in the decades we've been eating in this part of town.   Gotta tell you we were pleasantly surprised. The service was very good and the food equally as good. We had calamari and jelly fish for appetizers and then followed it up one of their many Pho soups choices. Winner- winner all around good dinner. Small place that was pretty crowded and it appeared to have many locals as they were chatty with several of the tables in a very comfortable way. Next time I'll try something a little more authentic.\n",
      "Eggplant in garlic sauce is the bomb. The noodles are definitely the highlight here  and the steamed or fried dumplings are fantastic as well.\n",
      "Came in here after it being recommended by my uncle. Came back feeling disappointed. It's a plus that the noodles are hand drawn but that's the only thing thats making this restaurant special.    I got the fish noodle soup. The fish was nicely cut and tender. However that was it. The soup itself felt bland. The noodles also didn't feel or taste any different from other noodle places. I mean  if you're going to make hand drawn noodles your selling point  at least go through with it.   My dad had the lamp noodle soup and he said that the lamb was tough while the broth was bland too. I've tried both of our soup's broths and it tasted like they had the same broth. Surprising since the toppings were completely different. Kind of lazy if you ask me.   My brother had the spicy szechuan beef and whoa  the sauce completely takes over the dish. It was so strong. While it's nice to have a strong punch  after a few bites you just can't take it anymore.\n",
      "Delicious! I am very glad we came. Located in the heart of Chinatown  this store is a gem.  My SO and I stopped here for a snack. The hand-drawn noodles in szechuan sauce were delicious (opt for the slight price increase). The noodles were just ever-so-slightly overcooked but that did not detract from the great flavor of the broth. The meat was tender and very hearty and satisfying. My SO  who has spent many years in Shanghai  said they taste very authentic.\n",
      "The name and logo looks awfully similar to a restaurant just down the street.... I'd give this place a 3.5  Yup  it's another hand drawn noodle place NOT to be confused with Nan Zhou. We thought we'd give this a try and see how it compares with Nan Zhou. Prices look similar and so did the beef noodle soup that came out. I got the sliced beef one  which I also normally get at Nan Zhou.   The Noodles: you could definitely tell it was hand drawn since they were so different in size. It was strange how my noodles differed in diameter dramatically compared to my dinner dates'. I also found them to be extra tangled. I appreciate that it's homemade and good but I still think it should be more uniform. Also  they really do give you A LOT of noodles!  The Soup: It was good but it just lacked the depth that Nan Zhou's soup has. I also found that it left a greasy film on the lips and I had to constantly wipe them with a napkin.    The Meat: It was tasty and soft  I'd say better than Nan Zhou. My friend who got the beef brisket  felt like there was too much fat in his and the Nan Zhou one was better.   Overall  not bad. And if that was the only one around  I'd eat it again. However  since it is a copy cat  I'd still rather go to the original.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered a house special noodle  a sezchuan noodle soup and and something in chinese... The waiter brought us 3 bowls of beef noodles. It was ok. Still steamed because of bad service  not letting us know what we ordered....\n",
      "Spice C is one of my go-to spots in Chinatown if I don't know what I want to eat. They have a big selection of noodles  rice  and soup dishes  so I always find something I like there. Their house special beef hand drawn noodle soup is definitely my favorite dish on the menu. Make sure you add the pickled mustard greens on top because it really makes a difference. The noodle soup is really flavorful  and the beef is super tender. Their handmade noodles are out of this world. You can tell that the noodles are made fresh. They know what they are doing when it comes to noodles.\n",
      "Service was friendly and attentive  and the food was great!    We had naan  the cauliflower appetizer  goat curry  lamb kabobs  and potatoes.  (I can't quite recall the Indian names for the entrees  and don't want to butcher them!).\n",
      "We had been walking a long way in the sun and were very hungry  so we were probably the most grateful diners this restaurant has ever had!  Factor that in when reading our glowing review.  We're from Tennessee and we love Indian food and eat it wherever we go (NY  DC  Atlanta...)  Still  this was the best vegetarian Indian food we have ever had. We ate off the buffet.  The Baingan Bharta (sp?) was amazing. The lentils were also delicious  better than usual.  The naan  the carrot dessert  the mango lassi  the chutneys...everything was absolutely delicious.  I hate to think that our Indian restaurants at home don't stack up  but the truth is that this was way better.  The food also seemed light.  Some American Indian restaurants throw in a lot of cream or use too much ghee (or some other oil) and it makes me feel weighted down and uncomfortable for hours after eating Indian food. This was not like that.  It was lovely and cool and dark inside and the waiters were friendly. The only downside: it was on the expensive side.  Still we highly recommend Karma.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite restaurants. Service drinks are great. I miss their buffet but the food has always been worth it.\n",
      "Love love love this place!! Not only was the food incredibly delicious and beautiful  but the service was just perfect. The servers were so kind  helpful and thoughtful. Such a cute place  great dinner deal. Lots of food-naan was incredible. Everything. I'm just so sad I live out of town because id eat here all the time! So far  best food in Philly!\n",
      "I just had the most delicious Indian meal at Karma recently. The food brought back fond memories of food served in India. The decor is superb and the price for the entrees is pretty affordable considering the location of the restaurant.  For appetizers we had tootak - chicken wings. They were delicious. I had ordered a Kingfisher beer which complemented the food suprisingly well. For the main course we ordered Malai Kofta  Chicken Mughlai and Chicken Madras. The Malai Kofta is the best I have ever tasted. The gravy is delicious. The Chicken Mughlai seemed to have a similar gravy and it was as tasty. The Chicken Madras was not something I was really excited about and could be avoided.  The service was excellent and it was a really wonderful experience dining here. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Excellent food and excellent service. Mani was great at helping us make good food choices. All absolutely delicious. Happy we live around the corner. We will definitely be back. The $20 special makes this place a no brainer but don't forget to order some Naan with your meal (make sure it's the sweet one  can't remember what it's called.\n",
      "Here for lunch before matinee at Arden Theatre. Excellent vegetarian choices. We shared the Veg Thali and also a soup and salad  along with Veg Samosa. Wonderful variety and seasonings  with attentive and helpful service. If you're in or around Old  City  I suggest you check our Karma. We'll be back!\n",
      "My wife's first Indian food experience. Mani  the manager  was awesome. He took time and walked her through the different foods and flavors. She had tilapia and I had lamb. OMG it was awesome and what great service. Wish we were closer!\n",
      "Karma was off to a good start. I found myself in a very cool street with a nice evening vibe and I immediately liked the bistro-style of the restaurant as I walked through the door. The welcome and service by the waiting staff was really good and very friendly.  Unfortunately  it all fell apart when the food came  which I guess is the most important bit. The samosa appetizer just wasn't - a samosa  that is. The thick  doughy deep fried pastry was just wrong in every way and while samosas are meant to only be lightly spiced  the filling was almost devoid of any flavor except for the tang of not quite cooked potato left on the palate.  To me  it's always a bad sign when they ask how hot you want a curry sauce. Particular dishes in Indian cooking are defined by specific flavors and spicing  there are no varieties of heat for any dish. I have never been asked this question in India.  So  it didn't bode well for the butter chicken and  sadly  it lived down to my expectations. This dish is all about luxurious  smooth flavors and nothing to do with heat. This one was all about heat and was just wrong from its dark brown colour to muddy texture. On a positive note the rice was light and fluffy and the naan bread was fabulous but that's not enough to warrant a $35 bill for two dishes and a bottle of sparkling water. So very disappointing.\n",
      "Amazing food  excellent service and a wonderful atmosphere. We loved it here and will definitely come back! The staff were phenominal!\n",
      "I gave it one star because it doesn't give me an option to give it zero. This place sucks. Where should I start?? Okay  arrived at 7 pm with reservations and was seated in the dungeon. Fine. We ordered queso fundido with chorizo and got a weird looking cheese skillet with tortillas NOT chips. Odd! So had to ask for chips. Should've asked for a trash can. So we asked for some salsa to dress it up a bit -- that took an hour and I'm not exaggerating! The salsa was a thick mushy mess. Could turn the bowl upside down and nothng would've come out. Our food took an hour and a half  too. By that time  we were full on chips -- which were the only good thing on the menu! Oh... My favorite part... I ordered a side of beans and rice to go with my carne asada tacos -- which were more like unseasoned beef tips -- and I got a bowl of hard WHITE rice with refried beans on top. WHITE rice??? Seriously?!  Terrible! Dont waste your time. Taco Bell serves better food than this and that isn't saying much! Service was just as bad!!\n",
      "I thought this place was great. We stopped in for a few drinks and a plate to share and were happy with everything  especially the tacos and margaritas.\n",
      "Hanging out in Society Hill rarely happens for me  due to the saturation of wonderful bars and restaurants in my own neighborhood  but the urging of multiple friends and a birthday party finally brought me over to \\So-Cheet\\\" last night.  We hung out in the cozy  dark basement lounge  which was pretty great.  From 10-12 on Saturdays (and maybe Thursdays and Fridays as well?) they have a late night happy hour.  The special was $5 house margaritas.  While that may not sound like the most amazing deal to happy hour cheapskates  trust me - it is.  Sauza blanco  hand-squeezed lime juice  and simple syrup made for a tasty drink.  I like when you can actually taste the tequila in a 'rita.  While we weren't here for a full meal  we did try a few of the snacks:  -queso fundido: Delicious melted chihuahua cheese  served with piping hot fresh tortillas  mushrooms  pickled red onions  and peppers. I really loved those red onions.  I could bring home a jar of those. -the chicharrones: pork rinds served with a dangerously spicy salsa verde.  Again  amazing.  Service was attentive and friendly  and a DJ was spinning hip hop and funk.  I had a really great time here  and have to come back for a full dinner.\"\n",
      "The best Mexican in the city  hands down.   A little pricey but great happy hour specials.   My favorite part is the guacamole  which you get to customize by selecting what you want added from a checklist.   The staff is friendly too and very knowledge of the lengthy tequila list.\n",
      "Went here on a weekday evening when my brother and his girlfriend decided to make the trek to Philly for dinner with me and my fiancé. They rarely visit so picking an awesome restaurant- a task assigned to me as the Philly resident- was very important.   Xochitl did not disappoint. The vibe is understated Old City- totes relaxing  trendy but traditional  doesn't take itself too seriously but your server knows everything about the menu and food and drink is masterfully executed.   The guacamole was fantastic (if it wasn't  I wouldn't even bother to post a review...) which is a basic requirement for Mexican restaurants. Check.   Since we were feeling poor that night  my fiancé and I went with tacos rather than a full-on entree. Fish tacos-can you make them spicy? Um  yeah.  Melt in your mouth. Spicy brisket tacos- also very tasty. There were no leftovers. Our server and bartender colluded to prepare a dessert drink for us  a little shot of tiramisu liqueur goodness. And it was perfect.   I still can't say the name of this place correctly but I will definitely be back and I would recommend it to others. Mexican food done right is such a treat  and so nice to find in a fun place that has cool staff who can really deliver for a semi special occasion.   When I go back. I am looking forward to trying one of the ceviches...\n",
      "I was really hoping they would do something nice with this location  since it was my beloved old favorite spot to go to by myself. This is the old Filo's  I spent many nights there having a few drinks   listening and dancing to great music by the Worship crew  then walking home.   We decided to check this place out one Friday night when a friend from out of town was visiting. It was the perfect atmosphere and food in the downstairs lounge area. The music the dj was playing was great and funky  yet not too loud  so that we could still hold a conversation. The food was spectacular  we had the Ceviche de Callos con Sandia (watermelon and scallop ceviche)  I wasn't sure what to expect  it was not like the typical ceviche I have had before  but it was delicious. We also had the Queso Fundido  one with chorizo and the other with mushrooms. They were both devine!  They also have a reverse happy hour special in the lounge: Thursday - Saturday  10pm-12am. We had some tasty margaritas (although not the best I have had  but good enough for the price)  and we were feeling really nice by the time we left there  not too full  it was the perfect amount of food  and we still had some $ in our pocket!  I am definitely looking forward to going back to Xochitl.\n",
      "Best margaritas around  freshly made (not concentrate or artificial tasting sour mixes) from real limes. Best of all  only $5 at late night or after-work happy hour.  Definitely my new favorite special.  Guacamole is awesome and the spicy salsa they serve it with adds the perfect kick. I also had the squid hot-pot which was tasty  but I could probably eat dinners here of just the guac.\n",
      "oh.  my.  god.  i went here for south street's \\restaurant week\\\" (3 courses  30$) last weekend and it was amazing.  And that should say a lot considering that a lot of restaurants use restaurant weeks to half-assedly  crank out dishes for the masses in an assembly-line manner.    But not here.  every dish was excellent  and even artistic!  I had the avocado ceviche  barbacoa (perfectly cooked)  and chocolate souffle cake with cajeta ice cream.  We also ordered the custom-made guacomole for the table  a server came out and made it for us right at the table. And just as swiftly as he had made it  the four of us devoured it.  SO good.  And the waitress was super-attentive and more than willing to offer recommendations.  On top of everything  the place has a very cool atmosphere and is on a stretch of south street which is very pretty  especially on a temperate spring/summer night--perfect for a little post-dinner stroll or if you're en route to some bar hopping later.  Try this place--you won't regret it.\"\n",
      "I wanted somewhere new for Cinco de Mayo and had never been here.   Overall  it was okay. I liked how you could customize the guacamole-adding crab  tomatoes  garlic  etc but I thought the guac was a little bland still. The chicken tacos were good but nothing special. The margaritas were also just okay-maybe I'm used to flavored ones.  Would I come back here? Yes. Would it be my first choice for Mexican? No.\n",
      "The food was exceptional  but  we our entire visit was 2 1/2 hours long.  It was Monday  December 28th  2015 and we had a reservation for 7 people at 6:45pm.  The place was packed  which made us very excited to be there  it looked like people were really enjoying themselves! So  we were very optimistic.  We were seated  immediately. But  we noticed something almost immediately  there was only 1-2 servers AND they had continuous drinks to refill and grab from the bar.  The manager was running drinks and food  too.  We ordered drinks with appetizers after about 20 minutes of waiting. We didn't receive out appetizers for an additional 25 minutes (so we are about 45 minutes  now).  During our wait for the drinks and appetizers  we did manage to order our food.  We finally received our dinner orders at 8:00 PM (almost 2 whole hours of being there). At this point  most of our party had 2-3 drinks in them from the bar.  We all at very quickly because we waited so long and were hungry.  But  we still had to wait for the final bill. This took another 30 minutes.   Again  exceptional food (seriously)  but the service was a 1 out of 5.\n",
      "The customer service when I called for a reservation for a large party was so unprofessional and unhelpful that we never even made it to the restaurant this time around.  I had called and left a message and did not receive a call back.  When I called again  I was told there was no availability.  I know via urbanspoon that it would've been available if my phone call had been returned in a timely manner.  To top it off  I was faced with attitude.  They should consider who they elect to answer their phones.The quality of the food isn't high enough for me to put up with that.   There are plenty better BYOB's in this city.\n",
      "A bit pricey  but one of the highest quality Italian menus you'll find in Philly.  The service is attentive and professional  and the food is always wonderful.  My favorite is the Mushroom Papardelle  wide ribbon pasta in a mushroom-based cream sauce.  Incredible  although I'm actually not sure if that was a standard menu item or a special that day.  Like I said  the prices are on the high side  no doubt to help cover what must be some very high rent for that part of town (2 blocks off Rittenhouse Square).  And I think that there is a brightness and a \\starkness\\\" to the decor that  if cured by someone with a good design eye via a few simple changes  could go a long way toward making this a true 5-star establishment.\"\n",
      "My wife and I didn't want our last dinner on our Philly visit to be too heavy (no Del Frisco's) nor too touristy (no cheesesteak).  I yelp'd Melograno and we decided to go.  Soooo glad we did!  Notes:  1) needed to eat early as our 1.y.o. wouldn't last too late  we arrived at 6pm and did not wait. 2) by 6:45pm the line was out the door. 3) host was friendly over the phone  and equally gracious upon arrival. 4) BYO! 5) there's a liquor store 1.5 blocks away 6) ambiance excellent  rustic 7) baby high chairs  yes! 8) limited menu with EXCELLENT choices. 9) we ordered all the specials: gorgonzola meatball starter  filet for her  tuna for me. all cooked to perfection the first time out. 10) table bread quite good and served warm. 11) servers quick with water refills. 12) got a bit loud once it filled up  good buzz 13) ginger creme brule crisped well  yummy 14) host noticed our son had a skin condition on his chin - she mentioned a remedy (it worked!) 15) prices very reasonable considering we got specials   16) last but not least  our server LUIS was one of the best servers we've ever had at any restaurant  and we eat out a lot and in some very nice places. LUIS was courteous  attentive  understanding  and knowledgable - he interacted with us as if we were family and wanted us to have the best experience possible. The food was a delight  but LUIS won us over.    Will eat here whenever I'm in Philly.\n",
      "Had high expectations for Melograno  but I didn't leave super impressed. Nothing was out of the ordinary on the menu that we tried  but then again  it was Retaurant Week. The bread for the table wasn't warm - not a big deal  but fresh  warm bread can sometimes be a really pleasant surprise! We ordered the chicken liver crostini and the veal meatballs. Very simple and done well with a nice touch of fried sage leaves. I had the steak with a side of cannelini beans. The beans were literally just plain beans without any seasoning  sauce  or interesting texture. The steak was a bit chewy and underseasoned. A big portion and not terrible  but again  not worth four or five stars.   The desserts were probably the highlight of the meal: a warm chocolate cake and an apple cake with sea salt caramel ice cream. Proper portions  fresh  and delicious.  Unfortunately  I probably won't be returning to Melograno  although I did like the overall ambience  and of course  the location!\n",
      "The Melgrano experience was good enough.  The space is very open with few but interesting accents.  The seating is cozy  which is a good thing because on a busy and loud Friday night  you're practically screaming at your date friend or some combination of both in spite of the proximity.  The pasta we ordered (wild boar and bucatini with pancetta) were actually quite good.  However  the rest of the meal was nothing to write home or yelp about.  The pizza desperately needed some salt and the service desperately needed to be less frazzled and a bit quicker.\n",
      "Came here for my friends birthday with a party of seven. They were extremely attentive  bringing extra bread when we ran out  dousing our meals w fresh cracked pepper  etc. when the restaurant was completely packed. They recommended great meal Choices and everything we got was delicious. Combined with the fact that this place is a BYOB  makes it a no brainer! The pappardelle and the gnocchi of the day blew our minds.\n",
      "3.5 stars  I'll be the 1st person to let you know that i'm not a fan of italian food. When my friend recommended we have dinner here  I didn't want to be a debbie downer so I agreed. She got some wild mushroom dish which was good. I forgot what I ordered but it had to pull pork/meat in it. It was def tasty. Not what I expected.  It's BYOB so we got a small bottle to share nearby. The waiter was attentive (and cute) and he did recommend that I get the pulled pork/meat dish which I appreciated.  I do want to go back and try the grill octopus app.\n",
      "Yum!  I was in Philly for the weekend with my sister and friend of hers and we were in the mood for Italian.  We tried to go to Porcini's but they were booked for the evening and so we decided on Melograno.  We didn't have reservations but we managed to get the last table and had the most fantastic time.  We ordered Insalata Melograno  the Antipasto Rustico and various pasta dishes for our entrees.  The food was so good  it makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  I ordered the Spaghetti all' Amatriciana and it was very good but my sister ordered the Pappardelle Tartufate- I had a taste and it was delish!  What really sealed the deal for me was the service- our server was so nice and friendly!  I love this place!\n",
      "\n",
      "This place was recommended by a friend and boy was it a great recommendation!  Food was pretty darn good!  My absolute favorite is the mussels.  My two friends and I ate 3 servings of the complimentary bread - using the mussel sauce as a dipping sauce (I usually try to avoid the bread because I don't like to ruin my appetite  but it was absolutely IRRESISTIBLE).  Soo worth it!  Their pasta dishes are yummy.  I will definitely be back.  It is also BYOB spot  people!  My kind of place.\n",
      "This is probably one of the nicest and biggest Chinese restaurants in the area. When you walk in you see a large open space with multiple dining rooms and attention to decoration. But  some of that wears off when you sit down and your table is the stereotypical Chinatown dirty table with a paper menu.   Still  the food is authentic  even with English speaking servers! Soup dumplings have a thinner layer of skin than at dim sum garden or toms dim sum  making for a tastier experience!   Prices here are slightly above average Chinese food ($11 for string beans with no meat  anyone?) but service makes up for it (although they did give us the wrong item but it was easily switched out).   Btw  beef scallion pancakes is a must :)\n",
      "My first dining experience was marred by a service issue (waiter forgot to put in our orders) granted we came on opening weekend. But a legit dimsum place with good food I cannot pass on. I need dimsum. I miss good dimsum so I came a second time and this time with some newly made friends and we had a blast. The waiter we had was the right level of sarcasm trollin that we love and vibe with and plus he got our orders in and was just doing his job well and with care. Much appreciated! And there's a pool table! which is a nice touch to a night out. Thank you Jackson for giving us a reason to come back because we had lots of fun and most importantly the dimsum is delicious.\n",
      "It's out one of favorite spot for lunch with coworkers. Since it was open we went there more than 10 times. And every time we order same thing but we like that it stays consistent. My usual is wonton soup  which we actually can split between 2 people easy  and sticky rice in banana leaf. I love this sticky rice  I tried a lot of it in different places in Chinatown and I can tell this is one of my favorite. Soup dumplings are good  but I know better place in Chinatown  since it's in university city area  I would say they are the best. Actually I can say that Dim Sum House is the best Chinese restaurant in University City of Phila. I hope they will maintain being clean and solid. The service is always good  just remember that they serve as it's ready  so sometime everything can come at the same time  sometimes in odd way. Overall I would recommend to try it!\n",

      "Came here last night with a couple of buddies and had a good time.  Were seated pretty quickly  service was generally attentive food was tasty.  We had a selection of dim sum and main entrees: shrimp siu mai  spicy shrimp dumplings  veggie dumplings  authentic (meaning no soy sauce i guess?) fried rice  stir fried green beans  and stir fried potato.  We spent about 20 bucks per person  which was not bad for a Friday night dinner out with friends.   I will say this  if you are coming here for affordable/amazing/authentic dim sum  then this is probably not the best place for you.  The food is pretty authentic  but you will be paying a premium price for it (probably close to double the price you would pay if you went to dim sum in Chinatown).  In addition  the food quality (at least at the moment) will likely not blow your mind  it's standard decent dim sum.  That being said  if you're coming here for the atmosphere and for the chance to eat good dim sum for dinner  then it's probably worth it.  Small kinks that I think will likely be worked out as time goes on: serving utensils were limited (we had one serving spoon for pretty much all of our dishes)  and our plates  which were tiny  were not cleared out between our meals.   Definitely a nice and chill place to hang out with friends  I'd come back..I'm curious how things will change as the restaurant develops.\n",
      "Went there 3 times in 4 days. Immaculate service  loved everything we ordered except for the west lake fish  but I always have problem with that dish  wherever I have it.  I love the Jane G's over at Rittenhouse  and their university city location doesn't disappoint.\n",
      "Dim sum house's environment is calm and welcoming with their upbeat and  friendly servers. Their food is a nice modern take on traditional Chinese dishes. I highly recommend the beef scallion pancakes  soup dumplings and spicy tofu fish.\n",
      "I ate here as part of a group of 5 on August 11.  The food was decent  the service not so.  Perhaps it was just our particular server  but she left a lot to be desired.  Food was charged that was not delivered  and everyone's appetizer course came out together but mine.  The waitress described this as \\family style\\\" dining  but this concept was hard for me to understand since 4 of the 5 other people received their appetizers at the same time  and mine came out 2 minutes before my meal.\"\n",
      "Really a 3.5 stars would be more accurate. This place has a pretty decent happy hour  having a handful of their dim sum on happy hour for $4 or less. They were a little pricier than my other go-to dim sum place in Chinatown and I thought that their soup dumplings (pork and the pork and crab) lacked some spice (like salt and pepper) in comparison to other soup dumplings I've had. The crystal shrimp dumplings were good  as were the pork and leek dumplings and the pork bun bao. They were able to accommodate some of their dim sum for a vegan at our table (vegetable dumplings and sticky rice shumai). Overall  I thought this place was pretty decent and I would definitely visit again if I was in the area and seriously craving dim sum.\n",

      "I want to come back here for brunch every weekend!!! I had the breakfast salad which was amazing- whoever thought of putting hash browns and bacon bits in a salad is a genius  I'm just mad I didn't think of it myself! On top of the food being delicious the decor was adorable- I can't resist a restaurant with great interior decor  bonus points for all the cute lil plants in the windows. The waitstaff were super nice and although I went for brunch on a Saturday there was no wait time. If you're a brunch hoe like me you've got to try this place!\n",
      "Awesome ambiance. Slightly limited bar menu. Very delicious meal. Will come back and highly recommend.  Unsure of need for reservations since the visit was on Saturday night of MDW.\n",
      "Very relaxed local spot. Menu changes depending on time of the day  so make sure you look online before you go there they're offering what you want. Enjoyed my experience including local beers on tap and wine on top. Would recommend to anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great space. Bright with lots of windows right in the heart of Queen Village. Clean. Excellent service. I had a delicious breakfast salad - mixed greens  lentils  scallions  pancetta (yum!)  and a few more things I can't recall (all delicious) topped with two poached eggs. Unleash the yolk and the salad becomes even better. And the salad was accompanied by a think slice of toasted multigrain bread. Butter and apple butter were provided as spreads. Washed it down with an on tap Deschutes Cream Ale. The other three in my party all loved their food too. Thumbs up all around.\n",
      "Llimited brunch menu but what I had was pretty good.  I had an egg sandwich on a homemade english muffin with scrapple and a hash brown.  It was a little bland on the taste side  but I added hot sauce to add some flavor.  The place is small  but luckily I was there early enough so as not to have to wait for a table.  The service was fast and friendly  but I did get the sense our waitress was trying to rush us out.  We also had mimosas with grapefruit juice which were different and delicious.\n",
      "We had been wanting to try Hungry Pigeon for a while and we finally got the chance on a rainy English-type afternoon this past weekend. It's a small space with large windows decorated with several plants -- a very inviting atmosphere! There are outlets by the tables and it struck me as a great spot to do some work on a laptop or read a book by the rain-splattered windows.   We had a lovely little lunch there. Their menu changes regularly  so I was excited to see what was in store for us! I got the olive oil poached tuna. It was a light  simple dish with marinated cucumbers and potatoes and banana peppers  cooked tuna  and all on olive bread  topped with a hard boiled egg. It was a freshing and tasty lunch time meal. We also sampled some of the Nebbiolo wine with our meal.   For dessert  there were many options to choose from that were right on display at the counter where you order -- just waiting to be picked. We each got a large slice of the cherry pie with vanilla ice cream on the side. The pie was divine. I am not usually a fan of cherry pies  but this one was exceptional. The crust  the ice cream and the cherries all contributed to a delectable bite.   I will definitely be coming back here for breakfast and dinner. I would also recommend this place for a coffee and a catch up or a good read by the window.\n",
      "Because of such high marks  great reviews and being in the Philadelphia Magazines top 50 I decided to try this restaurant. My dining experience was on a Thursday late in the evening. The staff was pleasant and the place had a great overall mood with a chill vibe.   As for dining I was simply  satisfied. Of the three food items I highly recommend the Cider turnips if you like root vegetables  the old garlic mushrooms were cooked to perfection and succulent however they lacked flavor of any kind including the three large bulbs of garlic in the bowl . The pork skin tacos were quite unusual but delicious. I was disappointed they didn't have draft beer and the Molson I ordered was room temperature.  Many of the glowing reviews were about the breakfast items  maybe I'll come back and give them a try. This may be where they really shine. Otherwise the food was sufficient as well as the service I was just not overly impressed.\n",
      "Went for dinner. The food was good  but nothing to rave about except the Chicken from the main courses. The sea food main course was not that good and underwhelming.  We did not try starters  so cannot comment on that. Ambience is so so  our waiter was not too friendly and no one even bothered to acknowledge us when we left. Kind of a downer all in all. With so many great restaurants in Philly  not going back.\n",
      "The review is an average of a 3 and a 1.  I have had breakfast here 3 times on weekdays  twice in weekends  dinner once and Lunch once.  There are things I have had that are good.   The burger  the egg sandwich  the biscuits and gravy.  But there are just too many mistakes.    The service is a little uneven which I can forgive in the beginning.   3 dollars for a single mug of coffee with no refills.  Regular restaurant prices for a \\glass\\\" of wine served in a small juice cup.  Not sure if uts supposed to be homey but That's a little much.   But I had an entree with uneven roasted veggies that could've easily been diagnosed in the kitchen or at the pass.  I just had an oyster mushroom hash a week or two ago.  The hash was bit particularly rich on its own.  Which could have been fine if the eggs on top had not been so over cooked that the yolks were dried and flaking out.  A hash is premade and the only skill is an appropriately cooked egg.  I did not even eat half of it.  I was sat at the counter and didn't feel like complaining on my own and the server didn't even ask if everything was OK when I returned a plate full of good with eggs hardly touched.    That is my issue with the service and the place.  The menu sounds good  the room is great  the baked items are great  the coffee is good if not pricey.   But the food  for its prices and wait  is just not being paid attention to.  You cannot send out seriously over or undercooked good at those prices.     I live nearby.  I want to love it.  And I still go for a quiet weekday and u do now understand how to order.  But three bells  same as vedge or osteria etc  I just don't see it at all\"\n",
      "Hike searching the area around a family function to get some lunch I stumbled upon Isot and was intrigued.   We arrived and were instantly greeted very warmly by the staff.   The decor is lovely and welcoming and we pursued the menu.    The menu is varied - things we knew and things that were new.  We decided to shake it up a bit and try some items we were unfamiliar with.  Service was fast  the food was fresh and delicious - we were not disappointed!   The right amount of spice  warm and cool.   What a wonderful lunch!  And the Turkish coffee is heaven.     I would highly recommend Isot for lunch or dinner - please move out of your comfort zone and try something new.   You will be glad you did and once here  Isot will become a favorite!\n",

      "We had a group of 4 for dinner on Friday night at 6pm. The reservations were made online and when we arrived  we were seated immediately. The ambiance inside the restaurant was really nice  modern but rustic at the same time. We asked questions about the menu (our first time at a Turkish restaurant) and the staff were very happy to satisfy our inquiries. The restaurant is BYOB  so we brought wine and beer  and glasses were provided for us as we sat down.  The food was absolutely fantastic. We had the Turkish dumplings (delightful!) as well as the appetizer sampler plate that came with eggplant  potatoes  yogurt  and hummus (all made in house). The pita that the sampler plate came with was nice and toasty (and we asked for more pita as we ate our meal and the staff were happy to bring us more). We also ordered the Isot special platter as our main entre ($75  serves 4 people). The meat was cooked to perfection  the lamb chops were juicy and done just right. There were sides of rice  veggies  salad  and sauce to go along with the platters as well. We had plenty of food left over  which I took home for the next day. Throughout our meal members of the staff as well as the chef himself came to speak to us and to ask us about how we were liking the food. The whole experience was very genuine  and we could not be happier with the food!  For an amazing meal with a lot of delicious food (more than we could finish)  each of us only spent $33 (which includes tax and tip!)! What great value for truly unique flavors and well-prepared meats! This place is also BYOB so you save on that. Would definitely recommend this restaurant  we will be coming back for sure!\n",
      "I have been in Philly for quite a bit of time 43 years to be exact i have seen them come and go. My family was greeted and seated properly under a loud speaker nothing wrong with the music but loud  so i ask if they had doner   gyro  \\ no\\\" a lot of excuses  ask if they had Liver (arnaut ciger) a specialty \\\" No \\\" . So for starters we had a salad tasteless  icli kofte very small portions  oh we ordered Cig kofte oops forgot to put it in.for our main meal Kofte (Turkish grilled meatballs) for my daughter Lamb Kebab for my wife and a mix grill for myself. Well presentation was great for all of the above  lets see meatballs were over cooked on the well done side small sizes takes 2 min. to cook Lamb kebab was over done for my taste right oh ye did not ask how we wanted it done. In between our meal  there were some noises came from kitchen got louder manager and the cook or chef were arguing  very obvious my daughter was making fun of it  very entertaining for all of us. Ok dinner is finished dessert time  rice pudding no rice  here's the best part no BAKLAVA !!! \\\" but we have Tiramisu\\\". The reason i am writing this is i called the manager about all this he did not want to here but give excuse. Sorry guys but i will not recommend this place.\"\n",
      "Honestly  I'm a bit surprised about all the 5 star reviews. The atmosphere was great  our server was a sweetheart who checked on us frequently  but the food... Meh.   We got a shrimp appetizer that was pretty good. The shrimp were cooked to perfection (thoroughly cooked  but still had that crunch) and the sauce was pretty tasty. No complaints about the dish  but it was like $12 for a little bowl of cooked shrimp in sauce.   Also got chicken  lamb and beef kabobs  along with some grilled veggies. I was really looking forward to some kabobs and these were a bummer. They were all very overcooked. I can see the chicken being cooked well  but grilling beef and lamb until it is black  hard and dry is definitely not what I'd expect from a restaurant. We ate it  but it certainly wasn't enjoyable.   Maybe I'm ordering the wrong thing here  I don't know. But kabobs are a Turkish staple and with a number of similar places close by that make it better and for less $$  I'm not in a rush to come back and try the rest of the menu.   Overall  if you want Mediterranean/Middle Eastern style food and care more about ambiance than food  then I guess you'll be fine.   Sorry  Isot. I really wanted to like you.\n",
      "I am a picky spoiled eater. On top of that I eat Paleo. It is extremely difficult to find a restaurant that would deliver great quality food that is also healthy  even in a city as big as Philadelphia. I have decided to try Isot's food after reading many great reviews on various sites. Indeed - the food is exquisite  very fresh  very tasty  very well presented. The customer service is equally great  and the decor of the restaurant and its ambiance will transfer you to the Mediterranean in no time! This place is worth your time and money. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "I wish I had a bigger belly! The meal was really awesome!! I ordered the Tender Calamari and Mixed Plate for two people. The calamari was slightly fried  it was cooked perfectly! The Mixed Plate was a highlight. It was full of flavor with every bite especially chicken  tender and juicy. The waitress was attentive and lovely. Can't wait to go back again!\n",

      "Sussshi Burrritoooos   is the excited sound that keeps playing in my head as in some japanese game show   whenever i am about to order at Hai street.   Don't be fooled by the ho hum production line setup   the ingredients and the idea are really fresh and exciting. Couple that with a staff that genuinely gives a damn about the customer's order  it is pretty hard to go wrong with this place.   The salmon and tuna was delicious and so were mushrooms  and having the choice to order it in a bowl can help channel one's inner Gojira as you devour through the meal. Equally good for lunch and dinner !\n",
      "I laughed at first  but was dragged there by my teens who decidedly love the place. And you know what? For less than $10  it is a really great and yummy alternative to a sandwich or burger for lunch. Very fresh and incredibly quick service.\n",
      "Finally tried this place for the first time and had the Gochu-mango spicy tuna bowl. Listen  this isn't authentic Hawaiian poke  but I wouldn't expect that here. If the goal is to offer sushi burritos and poke bowls modified for American tastes and suitable for serving high volume  I think Hai Street meets that goal. There's more rice and mayo than I need and than you'd find in an authentic dish  but really enjoyed my lunch and service was fast. Tuna seems high quality and the toppings are pretty authentic. The essence of poke for me is freshness and contrasting flavors and textures and that was nailed. Spicy  sweet  and tangy and crunchy & soft in one bowl wakes up the palate. Nice alternative to my other work lunch options in this are!\n",
      "Got the flank steak wrap and it tasted really good but unfortunately the portion size is more like a snack than a meal. I had to get a sandwich somewhere else afterwards. So basically their $10 wrap is more like an appetizer.\n",
      "Interesting concept. It's actually quite delicious. I'm a huge fan of sushi  so I thought I would give this place a try on a friend's suggestion. I like that they have a \\create your own\\\" in which you pick the protein  up to 4 toppings  sauce  and crunchy topping for the price of the protein. I had the katsu chicken wrap with spicy mayo  carrots  cucumber  pickled onions  and tempura flakes. It was delicious  and very filling. I didn't expect the katsu chicken to be cold  but it still was very tasty and had a crunch to it. I also tried their wasabi guacamole with chips. The guacamole was very good...just a hint of wasabi to give it that unique taste. The chips were amazing!!! Thick but light  salted to perfection  and not overly oily.  My only complaint is that for a \\\"sushi burrito place\\\" they didn't have a spicy tuna option....maybe my sushi tastes are way to Americanized  but whenever I have sushi that's a roll I always get. Overall  this is a great place  and I will definitely come back. The food is fresh and you feel good eating it. The staff are friendly.  Just a heads up that It's more of a take out place since the place is kinda small...there are maybe 6 bar stools along the wall and you could probably eat here if it was 2-3 people  but it's not meant for groups.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I walked by this place on the way to a meeting  and knew I'd be having lunch here later on. I love all things sushi  and DIY sushi Chipotle style was something I needed to try.   I built my own roll  with salmon  mango  and a few other ingredients. I found the mango to be way over powering  and all in all the roll was nothing special.   I had the experience  but don't need to go back. I'm just as happy with a 3 roll combo from a cheapy sushi place near by.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I had refrained from writing a review from this place to see if they improved but it seems it's not going to happen. The staff is SUPER rude at this location. I have tried coming here on different times  different days and it's always the same thing. The items displayed on the menu are not available half the time and the staff tells you as if you should expect this to happen in every restaurant. The food at Hai St is good but I will stop going to this location until they decide to hire decent people for the job.\n",
      "I ended up here to celebrate Laura S.'s birthday.  It was a great evening  but Opa itself left a bit to be desired.    Walking in  I was impressed.  Opa does a nice job of balancing classy and hip - the ambiance is trendy without being over the top  and I loved the way the tables were positioned around the sides of the restaurant with the bar in the middle.  Service was friendly enough  but a little behind the ball.  The drinks took a long time to come from the bar  and our servers never asked us about drink refills - we had to flag them down.  Another example: when a friend and I asked to share an entree  they brought it out on a single plate.  I know the establishment is under no obligation to split an entree into two plates  but when the kitchen or server takes the extra time to do it  it makes a big difference.  The food ranged from mediocre to very good.  Appetizers beat entrees  hands down.  The octopus appetizer was tender and flavorful  and was my personal favorite of the evening.  The pita bread that came with our spread pikilia appetizer was also warm and delicious. Unfortunately  the quantity of pita isn't enough to balance out the amount of hummus  tzatziki  etc  and you're left spending another $4 for another order of pita (or eating your tzatziki with a spoon).  The spinach croquettes were enjoyable but not particularly memorable.  Same goes for the horiatiki.  The entrees sealed the deal on the three-star rating.  The steak  ordered medium rare  was surprisingly large  but arrived at the table medium well and was tougher and fattier than we had hoped. The fish was flavorful but a little dry.  The burger wasn't particularly memorable either.    All in all  it was a nice dinner  but we decided to head elsewhere for dessert.\n",
      "McGillan's was closed so ended up here instead.   The food here is tapas style  small portions.  The food was excellent  but by my calculations  every bite of food cost about $1  so come here if you are looking to savor a few small portions of food  but not if you're really hungry.\n",
      "Overall the food was very good. We had beef meatball  gyros  Chicken kebab  hanger steak and fingerling potatoes. Chicken kebab and hanger steak were delicious.\n",
      "This place is solid.  Great overall experience.  You can wear jeans!  You can wear a t-shirt!  It's summer.  You can also wear a pretty dress!  Opa takes care of the fancy with their cute servers and well thought out dishes.  Not a lot of clutter on the menu  equal apps to main dishes. Smart wine. Modern Greek meets (larger portion) tapas experience.  I expect to get action if I brought a date here.\n",
      "Nice little bar.  Great happy hour too  a few $3 drafts  $1 skewers  $2 sliders  $4 wine  and the most delicious french fries.\n",
      "The $15 lunch special is a great deal  to bad the beer garden isn't open for ourdoor seating on nice days  sitting out front in the alley with the garbage trucks and delivery vans is just not the same...\n",
      "I went last week to celebrate my birthday with a friend. Everything was great: the service  the atmosphere  and the food! Richard our waiter was very nice and personable  which made the experience that much better.   My friend and I ordered the hummus and pita. We were surprised at the fresh-baked pita with asparagus on top. The saganaki was delectable  the fig on top was a nice touch. I had the village salad which far exceeded my expectations.   While we were eating  the chef came out and introduced himself. He was very nice  too. It was a very nice night.  As a vegetarian  it's sometimes difficult to find choices without feeling limited. That wasn't the case at Opa and I can't wait to go back!\n",
      "\n",
      "Our initial plan was to try the pizza place next door but their wait was so long. So we found Opa by coincidence but really enjoyed their food and their atmosphere. There is a square bar area in the middle of the restaurant. and then there are more private tables at the back of the restaurant. The food was delicious - surprisingly. We ordered the cheese platter  greek salad  and a pasta (can't remember the name). Heads up  the portions are really small. I think the pricing is more on the high side considering their portions.  From 10 p.m. they make it like a club setting - really loud music! - We couldn't talk / hear ourselves so we left. Would definitely visit again with a group of friends to share multiple dishes (like tapas style)\n",
      "Most recently visited Opa for lunch but have been to both the beer garden and restaurant multiple times.  They have a great lunch special - $10 for 1/2 sandwich and salad/soup. The beet salad was delicious as well as the chicken gyro. Service was a bit slow  especially for lunch on a weekday when people are trying to get in and out.  The beer garden is great. Very spacious with a good selection of beers. They have a limited and different food menu at the beer garden (think more bar food) but still tasty nonetheless.  I'll be back  but will make sure if its for lunch I have plenty of time.\n",
      "My go-to spot on a Saturday night! I was real bummed that lucys closed  but was pleasantly surprised by this bar just across the street! Their food is better than expected. I always get wings and fries. (be careful of the wtf sauce though) Sometimes it takes a real long time to get the bartenders attention  but the place is usually packed. And if you're lucky the always sunny crew will pop in!\n",
      "This place has a few good things going for it:   1. REALLY good gravy fries...seriously  if you haven't had them yet - you haven't lived 2. The staff here is friendly and entertaining! Don't let it alarm you if a waitress and a member of the kitchen staff randomly have a lover's quarrel...its all part of the character of the place! lol! 3. It is the perfect bar to watch ANY Philly sports team...but especially the Phillies.  4. Pretty good beer selection  too!\n",
      "To sum it up  it's an average bar with ties to a very well-known TV show - but that fact doesn't make the food or much else better. When I went they had $4 White Rascal's and on top of that I had the normal gravy fries. $11 for fries  steep to say the least. They were steak fries  covered in gravy and mozzarella cheese and while pretty damn good  I would be hesitant to say that they're worth the price. Service was good  sometimes a little slow  but still friendly.\n",
      "Good beer selection. Not the best. Chill atmosphere  partially owned by the cast of it's always sunny.\n",
      "I came on Saturday in the afternoon and enjoyed my time there. The staff was friendly and willing to chat with you. They have a decent draft and bottle list. I ordered the Dante Piccante burger and it was spicy  but delicious! I will come back for a bite and beer!\n",
      "I finally made it to Mac's on a Wednesday night for Quizzo.  I'm a huge Always Sunny fan so this place was pretty much guaranteed two stars.  Some of my friends are regulars so they know the bartenders.  The servers were really helpful in setting up our oversized quizzo team table.  I only stayed though the first round  but the questions were decent.  Only problem is that its really hard to hear the questions in the back.  I definitely think this needs a spot in the UYE Cross-City Shuffle.\n",
      "Went there for my birthday this summer because I'm a huge Sunny fan.  I ordered Hummus so that I didn't get drunk too fast.  It was so good  I got some to go at 2am.  If you don't get the Hummus at Mac's then I just feel bad for you.  It's so good it's almost criminal.  Trust me  I'm chubby.  I know food  :P\n",
      "Good beer menu and great food options.  The chicken fingers are killer  especially with the Mac's House gravy fries.  If you see the Sweet D's Sausage & P's on the special's menu pounce on that.\n",
      "We went here because we found a Groupon and because of the owners  who star on It's Always Sunny. It was pretty loud and my food was lackluster. It tries to be upscale tavern food  but that type of food nearly always fails. They are strict about no substitutions which is annoying. They did have a good beer selection with some I've never heard of which is always good. I'm not sure I'd go here for the food  though the Groupon made it better. Also kind of slow service and kind of cramped since the bar crowd stated filling up the restaurant area. I would go for the beer selection.\n",
      "Hidden gem in olde city. Fun bar that has some really good sweet potato fries! The fries are on steroids and come with some honey horseradish sauce that are a dream come true. I devoured those bad boys like they were my last meal. Believe the hype!  Our party sat by the jukebox right by the bathrooms  but the music was way too loud for a casual Sunday evening. I have to work tomorrow  and I need my voice! I don't need to shout over to a friend right across for me. If they can fix that  then I'll be a happy woman. I just won't share my fries.\n",
      "was a bit disappointed with their tacos al pastor.  had a lot of meat but were slightly bland and no pineapple.  the tacos al pastor at Los Taquitos de Puebla nearby are much better.  salsa's were a bit bland  too.  will not be returning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shrimp burrito is amazing  I dream about it every night. Always fast delivery. 2 thumbs way up.\n",
      "Man oh man this place is a sea of awesome foods and you will not know which one to get. Walking in you see a tiny little place that seems very homey and family owned. Looking at the menu you see fantastically delicious and overwhelming perfect dishes all smothered in cheese and sauce and awesomeness.  I got the nachos cause nachos are the best. Friends of mine got the burrito  quesedillas  and enchiladas and all were as magical as riding on a rainbow during sunset.  Food was good  service was mediocre. But honestly  the food was so good I didn't care.  Go  it's brilliant.\n",
      "I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food  but I do enjoy a good taco. In my admittedly limited opinion  El Jarocho has the best in the City. Their steak tacos are excellent  forcing me to make a weekly trek down there despite the fact that I live in University City. I've tried the Mexican Burrito once  and while it was ok  I just can't help ordering the steak tacos with a Mexican Coke and flan for desert every time. Aside from that  the chips with the pinkish/orange dip is a great combination. Another positive: the place is BYOB  so you can come in with a six pack of Modelo Especial or a bottle of Cuervo if you so desire.   On the downside  they have one waitress who doesn't speak English especially well and tends to mess up my order slightly (I always get my steak tacos without onions). Now that I know what a \\cebolla\\\" is I don't think that will be a problem anymore.\"\n",
      "I'm glad I gave this place a chance  as I got nervous from the neon sign screaming \\Tacos\\\" and shaped like a Taco Bell taco.  Try to understand where I am coming from - I have been traumatized by some terrible food here in the city and/or puzzled about things like putting cheddar and lettuce in a taco.  Their tacos are actually very good and huge  so you get filled up.  The meat reminded me a lot of tacos in California  and that's a good thing.  And no damned  lettuce and cheddar cheese.  My boyfriend got a chicken burrito that was the size of an adult cat and he said it was delicious.  I want to try their burritos next  though it will be a tall order to beat out a San Francisco burrito.  The service for take-out was a little slow  but I could see that there were a gazillion delivery orders they were getting ready before I came in.  The waitresses were nice and the interaction gave me the chance to use what little Spanish I have.  Oh  and they have champurrado.  FTW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Other posters say this place is inexpensive  though I think that's relative.  I'm used to paying (when I lived in Cali) 1-1.50 for a taco and under 6 for a burrito  and under 10 for a non-seafood plate.  This place  and all others in Philly that I know of cost far more than that.  I guess Mexican is more of a treat here  rather than the staple it is in Cali  hence it's something you get when you have extra money  not something to go out and eat everyday.  But I digress...\"\n",
      "Yesterday 3 14 I decided to eat in El Jarocho. I ordered enchiladas de mole con pollo with horchotta to drink. The enchiladas were very good not spicy at all. The food was served very fast. Before the food was served chips were given with salsa verde on the side along with another sauce that I'm not sure what it was called. The other sauce was delicious! I will be back here again soon. Thanks for another delicious meal El jarocho!\n",
      "I'll keep this one short and sweet. I've been here 3 times now.  Good  authentic Mexican food! Have the Pasole  it's high quality! Only wish they offered a side of oregano and pepper flakes with it. Good tacos and even better Carne Asada. Guacamole is fresh and service is ok. I definitely recommend! I'll be back soon!\n",
      "sssshhhhhh go away....don't go here.   Let it remain pure. Let it remain simple.   Mexican simplicity done artfully in a low-key but tasteful environment.  Service was impeccable. Food was excellent. Prices were fair. Selection was awesome.   Get it now before something changes.\n",
      "This place is a little hole in the wall place in Bella Vista right near the Italian Market. Their menu is extensive and very cheap  with portions being more than generous. The servers are always pleasant and ensuring you are enjoying everything and checking up on you. I tend to switch between the tacos and burritos  but I have also tried some of their entrees and have never been disappointed. They start the table off with free chips and salsa (as well as this creamy sauce). It is super filling and super tasty  I would definitely recommend this authentic mexican place to anyone who is looking for cheap  tasty  and filling eats!\n",
      "Very dissapointed at the amount of food at the table. As a scholar of Latin dishes  Garces would expect to have some sort of understanding about the Peruvian culture. We eat in quantity. Granted  the scallion pancakes were good. The ceviche was good  up to par with other ceviches in NYC  but smaller.  If you enjoy the decor of food  you will enjoy Chifa. I never understood people who likes this sort of artistic value. I rather eat my food than watch it gracefully. Quail eggs? Really? There are numerous authentic Peruvian restaurants in North Philly that are cheaper and carry a bigger selection. Don't be scared students  traveling north is not a death sentence.\n",
      "Went here for NYE  I was equally impressed by the friendly staff  AWESOME FOOD  and tasty drinks. Both ceviches we had were excellent  crab empanadas were AMAZING. Our desert was an outstanding chocolate mousse topped with tapioca pearls and coconut shavings.   The atmosphere is  warm  pleasant  and classy without being pretentious.  I don't know why so many reviews give only four stars without mentioning anything that Chifa could improve on. I myself think this place is a great way to spend a classy evening.\n",
      "Garces does it again! I was disappointed by the absurdly small size of the Congee. When's the last time you had a rice dish that was lacking in the rice department? I like small dishes when they are brought out 2 or 3 at a time  but we had to wait after each of 5 dishes. To make matters worse we were constantly interrupted by the waiters and staff. The house pan  Pork belly buns  cod  and the lomo saltado were superb.\n",
      "Went here for restaurant week  and it was probably one of the top five dinners I've ever had.  The duck tacos were freaking unreal - I didn't know duck could taste this good! I don't know what price range this place is usually at  but for restaurant week  this was a steal.\n",
      "Great cuisine and a nice vibe going on  The Tapas dishes are all pretty unique  I have never had bread with this unique texture. The Scallops  Thai Sausage  Fries  Pork were all great . Each dish has a unique taste  The 5 stars are a little generous but it closer to a 5 than a 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "CHIFA has a really interesting and well-executed fusion cuisine  and the food is delicious. The small plate style of dining allowed 4 people to taste a little of many dishes  and although I'm not a curry fan  the curry dish I tasted there was amazing. We all left very satisfied and full. This place is pricey...no getting around that fact. But we liked the food  service was attentive and friendly  and the chicken dish alone is worth returning for  just delicious.\n",
      "I have been to Peru  Spain  Mexico & Dominican Republic and have sampled the high-end cuisine in Lima (Astrid & Gaston)  Cuzco  Madrid & Cozumel. Based on my experience with the authenticity of this food genre it was sub par. Still good  however  for those that cannot tell the difference. I am a huge fan of Garces & his work but this restaurant just did not live up to the high expectations of Amada or Tinto quality. Restaurant week is a good time to visit because I could not imagine paying any more than we did during restaurant week.\n",
      "A beautiful  more flashy Garces restaurant that fuses very different cultures in Chinese and Latin flavors but Chifa works out nicely. The food is not mind blowing but it is presented artistically and the combinations are interesting. You have your pork buns and shrimp rolls that seem Asian but little Peruvian tweaks and influences make them their own. The coconut panna cotta for dessert is quite a nice way to end out the meal. Prices are on the higher end so it seems to be over priced for \\Chinese food\\\" and \\\"Mexican food\\\" but I guess you should get some credit for putting both together in a rational fashion.\"\n",
      "A big disappoint from the moment we walked in. The hostess was not friendly and when we check on the status of our table  they were rude. Once we sat down  we were in the basement which reminded me of lots of post office boxes all around. The tables were very close together. You can hear your neighbors conversation  even if you didn't want to. Once we order  the cold entree came quickly  than we waited a very long time for the hot ones to come. The Kobe beef and ceviche we very good  but the other dishes( red curry  octopus  lobster bowl) were just average. I would recommend Amada  but not sure about this one!\n",
      "\n",
      "Walked over here from our hotel and VERY happy that we did.  The four of us ordered different menu items and all were spectacular.  My breakfast sandwich was literally the best I've ever had.  The eggs were done to perfection and I can't get over how yummy the sausage was!    Great server  very friendly and attentive.  Thank you Sarah.    We loved it and would recommend to anyone!!  The easiest 5 star review in quite a while.\n",
      "Fast to get seated  but after that  we were waiting a while for water and to order. My sister asked if one particular dish was vegan. The server replied  \\The ingredients are listed. Wouldn't you know better than me?\\\" Perhaps. Perhaps not  if you cook your food in butter? Not vegan. After ordering it was evident the place could have benefited from a food runner. Too few girls trying to do too much at once. People kept showing up  making everyone's wait time a little longer  since the two girls were doing it all. One customer came and asked about a large table outside. The server alerted her that the table outside was leaving and asked if she wouldn't mind taking them their bill. Excuse me?! Nonetheless  entertaining  if you have time to kill. Food was decent. Not a lot of flavor  but do-able after a long red eye flight.\"\n",
      "I have been to Luna Cafe many times for their quinoa bowls  however  today I found a NAIL inside my southwest quinoa bowl. It was IN my mouth! I walked back to show them the nail (I ordered it to go) All they said was \\sorry\\\" and didn't offer to give me my money back until I asked for it. I will not be going back to Luna Cafe ever again. Be aware!\"\n",
      "Very disappointing. Staff does not seem to want give even mediocre service  despite having a restaurant that is not busy.   Food was a little pricy  but considering that you will wait an hour for your food  at least you'll get a lot for your money.   Biscuits and gravy were very watery. Skip this place.\n",
      "Staying with friends in old city  are here twice thus far. Service is top notch  smiles and politeness. Food was outstanding. Breakfast can be overdone  but they offer classics and modern takes on said classics that are danged tasty. Had the chicken and waffles the first time  and the biscuits and gravy with turkey bacon the next. Coffee both times was great. Food was great. People are wonderful!\n",
      "\n",
      "As visitors in town for a few days  I went here with a couple of my friends for brunch. I ordered chocolate chip pancakes with bacon  one friend got The Lumberjack  and the other friend got a buffalo chicken wrap with sweet potato fries. (Only have pics of The Lumberjack because the rest of us were kinda underwhelmed and didn't think to take a pic.) Fries and pancakes for both orders were over cooked burnt. Sausage for The Lumberjack was a little underdone. The food was just okay. CASH ONLY  which was kind of a drag  but there's an ATM inside (with a $2.75 surcharge for withdrawals  on top of whatever your bank charges for non-branch ATM transactions).\n",
      "Very expensive for way below average food ($13 burger that tasted like McDonalds) tiny $4 mac and cheese absolutely disgusting  service not good either. We paid $40 for one ice coffee  one quesadilla and one burger with mac and cheese on the side. No refills on coffee either. Service didn't bring ketchup or sugar. AND on tope of that is cash only! Go somewhere else on Market St.\n",
      "If you are in the market street area  this is a great place for a brunch... I have tried the omelette any style and coffee... Love it...\n",
      "Great service and the atmosphere was amazing! Only went to the bar potion  but simply tell the bartender what liquor you want and he will concoct a delicious drink featuring that ingredient.\n",
      "Amazing bartenders  amazing drinks  hand chipped ice in your cocktail. It doesn't get much better than this for a night out for great seasonal crafted cocktails. Everything made from scratch. We will be regulars for sure!\n",
      "The Farmers' Cabinet is quite the hybrid. Its bar resembles a refined gastropub while its dining room verges upon fine dining. It may sound ambitious  but it works well here.  To their credit  they don't overextend themselves with the menu. Each section has a handful of options which cover a nice variety of dishes. We had the lamb and the rib eye two ways  both were delicious and executed nicely.  They have an amazing cheese selection too and that goes a long way with me. Our server was excellent as well - informative  prompt and accommodating.   The music and decor of the dining room is all very old-timey and elegant. At moments I felt as though I were in the Overlook Hotel...an extra element of cool for the evening.    There is an abundance of great beer here  mostly European with a few house-made beers as well. It's a nice change from the typical beers to be found around town. If you're looking for something different  you would do well by coming here. If spirits are your game  they have a bunch of specialty cocktails that look intriguing too.   The case has been made regarding price vs. value. Entrees run in the upper tiers of pricing and as always  reactions to that will vary according to expectations  budget and taste. I was pleased with the quality of the food  drinks and service we received during this visit and felt what I spent was worth it.   All in all a wonderful experience. Next time I'm gonna belly up to the bar and give that a whirl. I just hope I'm not served by Lloyd the Bartender.\n",

      "Food and drinks were really good. Definitely a spot to visit in Philly. The only down side is that it got silly with the faux 1920s attitude. If they could just be a little more \\normal\\\" in how they treated the customers  it would be perfect!\"\n",
      "We loved this place. I don't know if it's usually as busy as it was when we went  but it was restaurant week  and it was PACKED. The food was good. I don't really have anything negative to say about it  but I wasn't blown away. I had the butternut squash soup  which was extraordinary  the duck  and the bread pudding  while my boyfriend had the duck pate appetizer  hangar steak  and chocolate cake. The beer list and cocktails  however  were amazing! We tried a couple of import bets and a few of the specialty cocktails. Each were delicious and incredibly unique. The live band and the 1920s Prohibition theme were so much fun. Service was a little slow  but extremely courteous. It expect that was only the case because of RW.\n",
      "Best New Year's Eve party ever! Drinks  music  atmosphere - perfection!\n",
      "I went here with the bf for restaurant week dinner. I've been hearing about their amazing beer selection and was excited to try their food.   The ambiance was pretty sweet. Loved their beer wall with candles interspersed. The barrel bar tables add a nice touch. The long picnic benches are good in theory and looks. In practicallity. meeeeh. That may be the one down star. I was stuck on a bench with a guy who liked the bench scooted too far from the table. Maybe I'm too short... maybe I'm too nice. But  I do like my own chair.  Now on to the food. Butternut squash soup with pistachios hit the spot on a cold winter night. Silky smooth texture with deep flavors. I had the duck for my entree. This is what really drew me here for restaurant week. It was the least tasting duck I've ever had. I dont know if that's a good or bad thing. But I actually enjoyed it. It tasted more like pork. My bf had the pork which was sweet  juicy and ham like. The desserts were ok. Nothing too crazy to rave about.   The draft beers are pretty legit. No scrimping on quality here. If anything.. that completely lived up to it's expectations. Cheers!\n",
      "The beer is 50:50.  Some is decent  some is lousy.  It's fairly expensive for what you get.  And no  I dont typically drink \\macro\\\" brews.  So  it's not my poor or inexperienced taste in beer that lead me to post this comment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe people come here for the beer.... Maybe people come here for the service... I thought the duck gumbo was delicious... But for the prices  I could have eaten a burger and gone to the circus....\n",
      "We had our wedding reception after-party here  and it was great. They accommodated us with a large area on the upper level.  The beer list is awesome and the appetizers our guests ordered were so delicious!  When some shots came out  one had a strange white pill-like tablet in it. That was super sketchy. We told the waitress and she promptly brought us a new one.\n",
      "They have a good selection  but the bartender had terrible pours. The beers were half foam  half beer  which is unacceptable when paying $9 for a beer.\n",
      "Food  wine and service were all great!  Try the gazpacho which is amazing!  Had the Shrimp and grits ( only served on weekends) and it was AMAZING!! PLEASE make this during the week  Strangelove!!  Since I couldn't have shrimp and grits....had the gouda grits during the week...WOW they are sooooo good!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great Happy Hour.  $4 drafts and wine  $5 basic mixed drinks.  $4 snacks included fantastic homemade chips.  Good dinner items including great veggie burger and tofu/spinach saag and kale salad.  Pork and Joe burgers were good but cheffie had a heavy hand on the salt shaker.  Very friendly servers!\n",
      "Amazing food and fun beer menu!  Had lunch with some friends and was incredibly impressed. The food was incredible (totally recommend the brussels sprouts and the Strangelove Burger). Our waiter bartender  Payne  was very attentive and helpful in making our choices. While it's changed since it's Doc Watson's days  you can still see the \\bones\\\" of the old place which makes old folks like me happy.  Great food  great service  lovely location. Win  win & win.  Payne is awesome - give him a raise!\"\n",
      "In addition to the amazing strangelove  burger I pretty much inhaled it was so good  the very helpful bartender offered to replace my half-drunken too sweet beer with a half pint of another recommendation. That is customer service 101. If I were a local these two things would make me a regular.\n",
      "We stopped in during an impromptu mini bar tour  and Strangelove's definitely impressed. The bearded hipster-type bartender was friendly and attentive  and the venue is extremely clean with crisp decor. Since it was around 2-3pm  it was a lull between lunch and dinner  but a great place to sit and watch some of the Phillies' game. Also  they have some special beers as partnerships with some of the Philadelphia breweries  which is cool - I tried the Porch  and it was enjoyable.\n",
      "I can't recall the day I went but it was a memorial resturant experience.  I was greeted by an incredibly nice cashier. After a hard decision I ordered a Devils delight and the girl giggled ( of course I was confused) She explained it was Dev's Delight and named after her because it was her idea for a burger and me calling it Devils delight was a bit funny because her friends call her Devil Dev ( hard to believe such a nice girl could aquire such a nickname but cute). After she took my thorough of a medium burger  and truffle fires i didn't have to wait very long. Even before I ate the burger the smell it self had my mouth watering.  The burger was cooked to perfection and what was on the burger was amazing!  This burger was a standard beef foundation with mozzarella cheese tomato basil and a portobello mushroom  what great idea for a burger! For a mushroom lover this with a side of the delicious truffle fries is perfect. Excellent quality and service   a bit expensive but worth every penny. No question about it I will be a return customer!\n",
      "Spot on!  I got \\the veg\\\" and the spicy fries.  \\\"The veg\\\" is a portabella burger  with grilled mozzarella  picked veg  arugula  and gauc.  Wholly non-cow is this thing spectacular for a bella burger!  The bella is on bottom  then the mozzarella is directly fused on top of that.  I actually thought the cheese was halloumi at first because it wasn't super melted (a good thing). The gauc and pickled veg are slightly citrusy and vinegary  but are contrasted by the bitterness of the arugula.  There's a nice bun to contents ratio  and for bonus points it's a potato bun.  Wasn't sure what to expect with the spicy fries going in - are they hot sauce fries  etc?  Turns out they are of the crab-fries variety with some subtle other spices added in.  Nice portion - not too big.  The atmosphere kind of reminds me of a dive bar - I think that's the best way to describe it.  It's pretty small  so I wouldn't choose to ever eat in most likely.\"\n",
      "Despite being a spin-off at the burgers from Rouge  I actually think that the burgers here are  dare I say it  better then flagship restaurants. Over the last year they keep expanding their burger and toppings options by editing the little placard next to the registers  instead of changing their giant menuboard every time  they decide to add a new cheese or vegetable you can put on the burger.  I've been here a few times  trying the 500 (lettuce  bacon  cheddar  special sauce) delicious  and also making my own combos with their Kobe Beef burger (I think its worth the extra few bucks). I like it with truffle cheese and grilled onions. The brioche bun also really makes these burgers something special.  Their fries are also extremely delicious. As a huge fan of truffle oil  I can never resist getting their truffle oil fries. When they come warm out of the fryer  coated in truffle oil  there is just no better taste known to man.  Most important of all  they are open late on weekends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Found myself here after last call. It was super crowded  but the staff was great and the food hit the spot. My burger was a little rarer than medium rare  but I was into it. Fries were good. Crowd was annoying  drunk and rude but the cook was CUTE  so no complaints!\n",
      "I almost always get Combo 5  with the juicy delicious 500 burger  truffle fries  and refreshing birch beer. Love the truffle fries.   I used to get food here at least once every two weeks  but the prices have gone up  especially for the fries. It's amazing how a $2 increase can change my eating pattern. It's still one of the better burger places in Center City with a relatively reasonable price. If you haven't tried 500 Degrees yet  you should... before the price goes up again.\n",
      "Ordered a Kobe burger with wild boar bacon and cheddar. The burger was good but not cooked correctly. I ordered the burger rare but it was raw. It could have used another 3 minutes on the grill.  The truffle fries were very well flavored with truffle oil but were a little soggy/under cooked.  The place was very busy and they got the food out quickly but I would have waited another 5 minutes to correct the problems above.  Also  the floor was wet and very slippery. Walk with caution. Since it was the end of the night the place was a little dirty. The tables and floor could have been wiped down.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a casual burger place  500 degrees delivers on taste  quality  service and speed. You can get a 5 star burger in a 3 star amount of time. It's so impressive.  Their selection is truly outstanding. You have your choice of patties  cheeses  toppings and condiments to build whatever burger your heart desires. I believe there are some suggestions as well if you're not feeling particularly creative that day.   The last time we were there  my boyfriend got the Kobe beef burger  thick cut applewood smoked bacon  a fried egg and Vermont cheddar cheese. He was knocked to the floor  and has been telling everyone about it ever since. I got a simple beef patty with cheese and BBQ sauce. Maybe I need to be a bit more adventurous next time! Nonetheless  I still loved my burger.  Another great thing about 500 Degrees is the option to get your fries with truffle oil. It's just a little extra flavor added to already spectacular crispy French fries.   I've always had stellar service here. I loved joking around with the woman who served us last time about coming through hell and high water for an as yet undetermined burger since we had come in out of a torrential downpour and it took me 10 minutes to decide what I wanted off of the menu. I blame it on the rain brain.  My only gripe about 500 Degrees is that it can get a little pricey. For burgers  fries and drinks for 2  we paid about $28. That included one Kobe beef patty  but even without it  you're going to pay a sit-down price for what is really a take-out burger. The quality justifies this in many ways  so we'll definitely be back. Save your pennies and splurge!\n",

      "The following are considered when I rate a more expensive restaurant. $60+/Person.  The first listed is the most important and weighted more than the line item following.  Flavor/Quality of Ingredients and Plating  Service (Initial Welcome to the last thank you) Ambiance/Décor/Environment Price Value of TOTAL Experience  You have read all the puffery of other YELP reviews  So  I'll try not to bore you.  Joined by Lips  looking fantastic with this years  Gucci shoes  matching Gems  and even down to the socks. With us were a hot new couple. Looking like a real match made in heaven. Class all around.  Now down to the food experience. 2 Stars for a restaurant which obviously uses great ingredients  creative dishes along with some ok service.  We started with an interesting service fowl up only to be handled poorly. The Server brought over what we thought was a complimentary start of our meal. Wasabi String Beans and then server brought over some sort of dull looking mush. At this point one of or party attendees called over the server (by the way we noshed on the beans) in which we inquired about the starters. At that point he stated it must be a mistake  he whisked the now not so complimentary dishes off the table and that was that. No apology  no nothing. We think a better way to handle this is to explain the error and ask us if we wish to continue noshing on the dishes   Its a \\sharing menu\\\" not for everyone. But ok...  The other couple ordered Smoked Scallops as well as we did  they were very good. They also ordered another small plate in which was enjoyed. Lips and I ordered the Smoked Mussels  good smokey flavor  they're were about 5 in the dish. Expensive for 5 morsels. The Cucumber Gazpacho with Crab tasted great  again over the top expensive for the portion.  Steam Clams  clams so small  it seemed silly. Plus the broth was just like any other Steamed Clam dish. Expensive considering the presented product.  Shared Entrees by the other Couple was a whole Black Sea Bass. Small but was reported to be very good. And the Wagu Steak. Again value vs portion very small portion but again strictly taste to be good.  We shared the Porterhouse Steak (97 dollars  holy sh^t are you kiddng me) Steak was Good  but again nothing extraordinary. Rosemary potatoes no big deal  they were potatoes. Grilled Cesear Salad  good but why was it served with the entree?   For this outrageously priced dish you would have thought it would be amazing. It wasn't  all it was was a Porter House cooked as expected. Meh meh and more meh. The correct pricing should have been 34.95 and just enough for one person. But 97 bucks to be shared? At time the food and its presentation seemed to be more ego than anything else.  Desserts were the Chocolate Mouse  excellent  the other side of the table they ordered some sort of Custard which was horrible tasting  almost like sour water texture  tasted like a Goat Milk. That was sent back and a Pound Cake Appeared to be a better ending.  All in all the Food tasted quite good. The service was ok but again nothing which would dictate the price points. Weird beginning. The atmosphere was sparse  nothing which would wow anyone.  Ok... PRICE? For the amount of food we ordered  we should have come away more than satisfied. We didn't. The portions are ridiculously small considering the prices are outrageously high. The value just wasn't there. Not even close.  Lets say for arguments sake the portions were better  the expense would still be way too high  but the review would be at a 3 star. (taste  quality)The atmosphere yawn   nothing  the service was ok  again at the level of a 100+ per people expect and deserve more  better and be satiated.  So a hard 2 stars for this disappointment. The herd mentality is alive and well on YELP.   FATTY SAYS SWING AND A MISS!!! Skip it and the Hype?\"\n",
      "Wanted to love . . . only kind of liked.  The food is all fine - not excellent  but pleasant enough . . . .just not pleasant enough for the price tag.  Go with light eaters  if you don't  there won't be much for you to eat!\n",
      "Came here with a few other couples for NYE. The ambiance was fantastic! Balloons on the ceiling  dimly lit  music not too loud  not noisy  very cozy and sexy.  Service here was spot on! Props to the manager that night-when I told him one of our couples had recently gotten engaged he gave us a round of champagne to celebrate. Food was phenomenal- wild boar chops  aged venison  lamb bolognese  a carnivore's dream! The squid was almost better than the squid I've had at Little Fish  the beet salad was very interesting with some broccoli rabe mixed in there as well. Drinks were strong and delicious- blood and sand  as well as the gimlet  stick out in my mind. Desserts at first looked odd (who wants a butternut squash dessert?) but sooo tasty! Only thing they need is some kind of super-chocolatey dessert and I'd give this place 5 stars. Very professional place  great service  unique food.\n",
      "The food here is very good but unfortunately I probably wouldn't come back. Here's the \\skinny:\\\"  What did I order: 3 Oysters  soft shell crab sandwich. Comes with homemade potato chips. Two beers.  The good: Oysters were delectable - fresh - excellent. Nice beer selection - I had a beer I never heard of - Birra  and Italian lager. Sandwich was good - crab was fresh. A nice combination of flavors including a little spice  but not too overpowering.    The bad: The portion size! And the price for that portion size. I'm embarrassed to admit that after spending $43.00 on my meal. I stopped in a fast food restaraunt on my way home and had fries. I was still very hungry.   Overall: Go for a beer and an app. Wouldn't recommend for a substantial meal.\"\n",
      "I was really excited to try a.kitchen. With the attractive location on Rittenhouse and the small  chic interior  it looked like an excellent eatery. I can't say that was the case based on my experience. I actually wanted to email a manager directly  but their website does not offer a means to contact them. We made a reservation for restaurant week and arrived to the waitress telling us they aren't serving the restaurant week menu for Saturday lunch (see photo attached). This was not indicated in any way on their page on the CCD site. We ate anyway. The coffee I ordered was very bitter  hair on one of the plates  and just overall underwhelming. Service was fine  food was fine  but for the prices and the other confusion  I likely won't be back.\n",
      "Cute little restaurant in an excellent location adjacent to Riten House Square with a nice ambience. The menu was very good with a lot of different options for brunch. The service was very attentive and quick. That being said  I ordered the burger medium and it came out extremely well done. The burger was topped with one slice of cheese of one piece of lettuce - $18. We also ordered the salmon on rye which came out on very dry bread. Unfortunately the quality of the food was not justified by the price. Great service  options and location.\n",
      "Good place to eat tapas style as they have several small plates and salads. But they also have entrees if you prefer. But beware of salt! Lots of dishes are over salted! Don't go near the chicken on the brunch menu if you don't like really salty food!  Food is all a bit pricey and nothing is amazing enough that you'll think about it after you leave.  Fresh oysters are great but pricey  6 for $18. Hamachi crudo great  two pieces  $13. Hit & miss... Smoked beets $14  are served cold Beef tartare $16  not great  A few salads  Burrata $16 and Radicchio $15 Pretty good. Probably the favorite so far was the burger. Perfectly cooked and not too big. $17   Not sure why but it takes FOREVER to get a drink but a nice wine list. Martini's were either too weak or not cold. Seems like they need more... and more skilled bartenders.   Servicer's are very good and knowledgeable.  Eddi (?) was our favorite. She was very  very patient with my fussy dinner mate.  This place can get very loud when it's crowded. Stayed at hotel for a month so had many meals. Wouldn't return as often if not for the convenience on snowy days and work picking up the tab. Better food is in walking distance...\n",
      "Review is of the cheddar and bacon burger on house made English muffin  and was take out.  GREAT burger! The quality of the meat was good and the sauce that they use was great. It came extra rare  which I LOVED!  This inst really a big or hearty burger like Whiskey Village or Rouge but damn if it wasn't tasty. I'll be having more of these. Probably my favorite burger in Rittenhouse.\n",
      "A. Kitchen is an utter disappointment. Went for brunch and service was very good and polished. I believe what they were shooting for were \\thrice cooked\\\" chips  a spotted pig fave. What we got were potato rocks with slightly sour taste. Kobe beef was chewy. High street and Fork are delicious but this needs work. You could do better in philly on a Sunday than this place for sure. Bread is awesome!\"\n",
      "I definitely see why a.kitchen has been named one of America's Best Wine restaurants. It was such a perfect evening with the temp at 78  leaving us in the mood for some outdoor seating and a nice glass of sparkling wine. Upon spying Cremant de Limoux  Domaine Collin  we knew that we were in for a really nice evening at this super chic restaurant. After the sparkling wine  we moved on to a glass of white  specifically the Chasselas Blend 'Alliance'  Marc Tempe  2014. After wetting our palettes  it was down to a few shared plates. We started with fried pickles  hamachi crudo  and the spiced cauliflower. The pickles were good  but the hamachi and cauliflower were amazing! As I am sitting here and writing this review  I wish that I had ordered another side of the spiced cauliflower to go! For our main course  we decided on the seared walleye...fantastic! To end our meal  we wanted to keep dessert light  so we went with the rhubarb cream. Just a perfect way to end a fabulous meal.\n",
      "I've been here for lunch  dinner  and also for a Saturday afternoon snack. I like how laidback and low key this place is. They also have a pretty good beer selection which is always a plus. For both lunch and dinner  I've ordered the mixed green salad with grilled chicken. It was a good size (same sized portions both meals) and had apples and goat cheese. I love the mix of greens and fruit. Between the apples and goat cheese  you can do without dressing. I always get it on the side and occasionally dip my chicken in it.   I've also had the Thai chili mussels and Cajun fries. The mussels were cooked well and I was a big fan of the sauce. It was perfect for dipping the bread that comes on the side. The Cajun fries are served with Cajun mayo.. they had a nice kick to them and were just spicy enough for me to handle.   Since this is in my neighborhood  I'll definitely be back to try more of their beer and mussels. I also can't wait for spring/summer so I can sit outside at one of their sidewalk tables.\n",
      "I didn't love it here.  The food seems decent  maybe a little expensive (almost 9 bucks for eight chicken wings) and I'd like to see a little more variety.  The website advertised daily/nightly specials but the 'specials' we were told about are what is already on the webiste menu.  Lame.  I'm not sure if EVERYONE (except us) in the restaurant ordered fish last night  or if this place always smells fishy  but it was bad.  Like low tide out on the wharf.\n",
      "I love dining here for their outdoor seating and their amazing mussels. The service is consistent  the beer/drink list is plentiful  and the red diablo mussels keep me coming back.   I've tried their margarita flatbread  buffalo chicken flatbread  kite and key burger  sweet garlic chili wings -- all very tasty but nothing spectacular. The calamari is delicious  but the mussels are their shining star. The red diablo mussels come submerged in this amazingly flavorful spicy tomato sauce broth  yummmmmmm.  The outdoor tables are (rightfully) a hot commodity but I have never waited more than 10 minutes for outdoor seating during dinner time.   I bring my dog and the servers always bring a bowl of water for him without even asking - great  attentive service!\n",
      "My girlfriend and I stumbled upon the K&K while searching for new apartments in the Art Museum section.  The K&K really made us excited to move into the neighborhood. We live in Baltimore now. Our waiter was a friendly artsy type who had great recommendations for food  beer  and tourist attractions that we could take in before our day in Philly came to an end.  This will be a weekly spot for my girlfriend and I.  For being open only a few short  weeks  I expect this place to get better and better.\n",
      "Beer selection is top notch. Rotating draft list brings us back.  Good decor  good ambiance  friendly ppl. Outdoor seating is perfect on a nice day.  Didn't eat  so we'll be back! It's next to Doma & Sabrina's. Stop in for a yummy beer!\n",
      "Great beer and vibe  and the bar food is not bad either.  I had the veggie burger which was surprisingly good. This is the kind of place that the girls will love to come with their boyfriend on a \\laid back\\\" date night to enjoy the open air  or to hang out with a bunch of friends and pound a few drinks.\"\n",
      "It's not great  but it's fine. I work nearby so my colleagues and I find myself here a ton  and I've probably tried just about everything on the menu. The food's okay  with some exceptions. The fries? Amazing. Everything they say is true. The veggie burger is by far my favorite thing on the menu  and I'm a die-hard carnivore. This place can be super noisy  which is great if you feel like being rowdy. But not so great if you want to have a conversation. When the weather's nice  sitting outside will fix that. Overall  a decent hangout spot.\n",
      "On a Monday night  I came in feeling good and wanted to dance   so I asked the bartender  who was playing sad emotional music to change the song to something more upbeat. He declined so I said I will go to the juke box and play what I think is more appropriate. The next day he informed my friend that I was annoying and I should never ever go back to that bad and that I wasn't welcomed. And that if my friend wasn't there he would have kicked me out. What kind of service is that?\n",

      "\n",
      "Wen't here on a date last night  the atmosphere was nice  we really liked the look of the bar area. We had a reservation and had hoped to sit outside  but when we got there we were told no outside seating was available even though I requested it. The food was good  but nothing spectacular  worth a visit if you are in the area but not a special trip.\n",
      "I like the atmosphere on this place. It's busy during the weekend. Gotta reserve ahead of time.  The bar tender made me something special and I really liked it. I'm a whiskey lover so I asked for something simple like whiskey w/ muddled fruits. It was very tasty!  The good is server tapas style. You can find meats  fish and options for Vegetarians and Vegans.\n",
      "Wonderful to eat here after visiting Spain and learning a little bit about \\real\\\" tapas and raciones. the choices here are varied and extremely well prepared with many interesting ingredients(lobster roe!). One caveat- some of the raciones were just tapa sized  the higher price reflecting the ingredient  duck  for example. Great space with interesting tile mosaics  service was impeccable.\"\n",
      "I love this place. The red sangria is just perfection  and the baked goat cheese is delicious. We always have great service as well  an amazing place for dinner and drinks.\n",
      "I really like this place.  They have a terrific wine selection  really good food and an interesting cool decor.  My only drawbacks are that it can be noisy  but I am eating in public so big whoop  and it can be pricey for what you get.  Still  I don't mind paying it  because the food is really good  I just don't go there as often as I'd like.\n",
      "Five New Yorkers rolled down to Philly to visit a friend for the weekend and had a truly terrific gastronomic weekend.  The dinner at Bar Ferdinand was especially notable... not only because we ordered nearly everything on the menu  and duplicates of a handful of them.  No  our sideshow worthy prowess at putting food away aside  the food was FANTASTIC.  Having tasted nearly everything on the menu (seriously)  the six of us agreed that the DÁTILES CON TOCINO empanadas (dates  bacon  cream cheese  honey  almonds) were our favorite.  Our second favorite was the CARNE A LA PARILLA (grilled skirt steak  lightly fried organic egg  truffle) which was also fantastic. But honestly  there wasn't a dish we DIDN'T like.  Really great meal.  Well done  Philly. Well done.\n",
      "I love this place.  It's my favorite spot to go out with one friend as you can just share a bunch of tapas (It may be a bit cramped for large parties to really partake in the tapas sharing experience.)  I've had just about everything on the menu and it's all good  but I try to stay away from anything that doesnt have cheese or some kind of animal in it because it can come out tasting a bit bland or just like olive oil.  My favorite dishes are the skewers with machengo cheese  apple foam  and walnut butter  the salad with grilled octopus (which was not the least bit rubbery)  and the empanadas with dates  cream cheesse  and honey which I usually save for dessert.    If you are looking for a full stick to your ribs meal  you may want to go elseware as that's not really what the fare here is meant for.  It's meant to taste a variety of flavors.  Usually when I plan on going to Bar Ferdinand I will cook a simple dinner at home and then hit this place up for tapas (read - drunk snacks) and sangria  and finish up with a sherry.  Service has been impersonal  but attentive.  REservations (made online) have always been kept.\n",
      "Stopped on a Sunday brunch and had the egg omelet with asparagus and crab  excellent. The $3 bloodiest and mimosa's are a nice plus. Server was attentive and was what we were looking for. A+\n",
      "Had the Tosta de Yema  and the Cana de Cabre = $18. The Tosta de Yema was an overpriced slice of grilled cheese  but the cana de cabre was pretty good. It was goat cheese with honey on top. Since this is a tapas place  they get a license to rip you off and you will leave hungry unless you spend $50. The service was good except for when the waiter threw a tantrum when we asked for separate checks (which we asked for before ordering).   Food Quality/Taste =  4 Star Portion Size Given Price = 1 Star Price = 1 Stars Service = 4 Stars Experience with Staff = 3 Stars Decor = 4 Stars\n",
      "Great Saturday Brunch!  My mom  two girlfriends and I came across a fairly empty restaurant at 3 pm on the Saturday of the nearby Art for the Cash Poor show at the Crane Building.  They were still serving Brunch and it was absolutely delightful.  We all enjoyed the pastries - goat cheese and fig was a winner as we're the churros.  My mother loved her poached egg over and unusual hash.  My husband who is terribly picky loved the Spanish version of French toast I brought home just for him.  We can't wait to go back  and I cannot understand why the restaurant was so quiet when we arrived.\n",
      "My name is Victor...so of course we had to go here!!  We were visiting Philly for Spring Break and little did I know that this is where Sylvester Stallone did the restaurant scenes for his role as Rocky in the Creed movie.  The store front is very traditional and the building was unique with an upstairs bar to wait and relax...when you show up without a reservation...like we did the first time :)!!  The manager and hostess were gracious and made us feel very welcome...this is a popular place! We were unaware that this is the home of \\the Operatic singing wait staff\\\"!! Lucy was our server the first time we went (yes  we went back a second) she was very gracious and had a wonderful voice!  Turns out she is from Argentina!  All the singers that evening had a wonderful voice and a huge shout out to the young couple from out of state that were given the opportunity to sing for the crowd!  They were Seniors in HS and had beautiful voices.  Definitely one of the highlights of our trip!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Food: 3.5 Decor: 4.5 Ambiance: 4.5 Service: 5 Value: 4  This place is special. While you are in an historic Italian restaurant in South Philly  it isn't necessarily the food that you are here for. It is the experience of the place. That being said  the food is certainly serviceable. This place would be even higher in terms of experience if the 2 person booths weren't so unbelievably small and uncomfortable.\n",
      "We walked in and the smile became wider and wider and folks I must tell you it made me have nostalgia as if I had seen this place before like my last life more than 90 years ago.    I don't have to talk about food which is a 5 5. The Burratta is as fresh as one could get direct from the farm. The pesto with bread is breathtaking it was simply delicious. We closed our eyes and savoured every lil bit of morsel.  We had Tortellini the Ravioli and Prince Egor with caviar.  All is all a 6 5 with the service the opera performance.    WE LOVE THIS PLACE\n",
      "A hidden gem in South Philly! Stopped in after a Phillies game and was impressed. I was never to sure about these rowhouse style restaurants  but I am sold. I ordered the Spicy Lamb Bolognese and my wife had the Homemade Crab Ravioli in a cream sauce. The food was so good I used the bread and wiped up every last drop of sauce. The atmosphere was authentic old world italian. Our server and the service was excellent. The best part was when all the servers (all trained opera singers mind you) take turns and sing an opera aria. I'm not an opera person  but this put an exclamation point on the meal and wrapped a bow around the entire evening. I didn't want to leave! I topped it off with Tiramisu and a Chocolate Martini. ECCEZIONALE!! Did the Phillies win? No. Who cares! I will be back soon!!\n",
      "Victor Cafe is a real gem...make sure when you go you have a drink upstairs in the lounge because it is quite the experience...when we got there we were greeted by Rick  the owner and he was very genuine and humble and took good care of us...the calamari was some of the best I've ever had...the food was very good too...the experience was PHENOMENAL!...every 15-20 min or so one of the staff gets up and sings operatic numbers...and they are ALL incredible...a must see stop in Philly!!!...\n",
      "Opera + great food + excellent service + post-prohibition history = 5 stars!! This restaurant is something unique. Let's start with opera. Most servers will perform at least once during your time there  so you get a great variety of performances - women  men  duos  French  Italian  etc. Our waiter  David  performed an exceptionally emotional duo performance. He was also a great waiter and seemingly great guy. He managed our girls night silliness with fun  poise and professionalism. Food was DELICIOUS! We all got pasta and we were all very happy. I got the ravioli - you can't go wrong with that. I also tasted the tortellini. Salads are big and shareable. Dessert was tasty - both were great the chocolate cake and tiramisu. Noise level was great. Other tables seemed very friendly - a nice crowd overall. This restaurant is unique and gives Philly some creative flair. Go and keep John DiStefano's post-Prohibition 1933 dream of food and music alive!\n",
      "I love this place and have been here too many times! The singing is excellent and the restaurant is perfect to celebrate a special occasion.  The food is excellent and the restaurant is pretty economical  given the service  ambiance and the opera singing :)\n",
      "Wow! This is such a great spot. The dining experience from start to finish was so much fun and very memorable. I felt like I was on a vacation and forgot I was in Philadelphia! We started our night with drinks upstairs. I highly recommend arriving early to get a cocktail up stairs in the lounge. After drinks we were seated at a great table and immediately experienced the opera singing! These employees are so amazing and talented. We really enjoyed the occasional performances throughout the night.   On top of all the fun entertainment  the food was incredible. We loved the pesto the serve with the bread. Both the burrata and calamari were great starters to share. All six of us got different entrees and everyone raved about there own dish. I ordered the Fra Diavolo with shrimp and it was perfectly spicy and very good. I tried some of my husbands Veal Picatta and the lemon butter sauce was light and flavorful.   We ended our night with the staff singing happy birthday to my mom  and shared a yummy cannoli. It was a great spot to celebrate my mom's birthday. Victor Café is the full package and I can't wait to go back!\n",
      "So one of my buds wanted to see this place due to movies being filmed here (see their website) and so we decided to walk from Reading Terminal to here. I have to say it was worth it. This review is mostly for the upstairs bar but we did not expect such a nice upscale setup.  I would definitely spend more time here watching more football games with the comfy setup. Drinks were well made according to my friends (I had a beer).  But the best part was I had so much to drink throughout the day that I left my credit card here and they mailed it back to me!!!! They are awesome and the 5 stars I have chosen to give is well deserved. Thanks guys!\n",
      "Food was good. Very fresh  which is great. Space is great too. Really good decor ambiance. Super clean. Staff is really nice. Ridiculously overpriced. $60 for 2 salads  2 juices and an appetizer is outrageous. I get that it's fresh and healthy and organic and all that  and I love that  but waaaaaayyyyy too overpriced. It wasn't a lot of food either. If I spent $60  I want to feel like I'm eating $60! :) Yelp won't let me do 2.5 stars  so I'm doing 3.\n",
      "This place is adorable!!! The food looks  smells and tastes amazing (get the chocolate tart!)  the owner Andrea is lovely and welcoming  and I can't wait to come here for dinner. Plus  it's vegan  gluten free  AND kosher! The only problem is  it's a block from my apartment and offers delivery... Too tempting!!!\n",
      "Although the desserts were amazing  no one in my party enjoyed their meal. Everything was so salty  I couldn't even finish mine. I had the sweet potato biscuit and gravy. I stopped halfway through after my third glass of water  just couldn't get through all the salt. The coffee was good  but the service was incredibly slow. I would go back to eat the dessert but that would be it.\n",
      "Everything looks delicious! The location is great- close to a beautiful park and lots of shopping. I had the turmeric ginger tea with their homemade Brazil milk (highly recommend) and the Burmese Chickpea salad. Adorable ambiance for events  too!\n",
      "This place is awesome! Especially for those with dietary restrictions or who chose to live a paleo/vegan/etc lifestyle. Be prepared to pay more than your average cafe but consider how much the grocery bill at an organic grocer would be if you bought all of these ingredients on your own.....pretty sure there's a whole pineapple that goes into one cold pressed juice. Those aren't cheap- I think the prices are fair and you get a high quality  conveniently prepared  delicious item for the price. Pad Thai and beet salad are my favorite lunch items and the baked goods are pretty darn perfect.   P.S. & Co is a gem and I wish them great success so more locations start popping up in other neighborhoods!\n",
      "Fresh  inventive but highly overpriced. We stopped in for some vegan friendly items but left feeling disappointed. The fresh juice was bitter  the fresh homemade sweetners and milk did not balance out the coffee even with a heavy serving and the cookies were blah. I was super excited at the idea but it needs a bit more balance of flavor and sweetness when you are selling the idea of health sweets.\n",
      "I made my way to PS&Co last night to the utmost urging of my friend's visiting friend. As a vegetarian  I am very pleasantly surprised by the roster of veggie places in this place (philly)  they just keep crawling out of the woodwork.   After crushing a margarita pitcher and hummus with chips at Wrap Shack  we made our way through the frigid air to P S & Co. What does that shit even mean anyway?   This place wasn't exactly lit on a Thursday evening at around 7pm  with about one or two other tables occupied. We were given plenty of attention. It's a cute and casual sit down place.   As per usual  I was down for ordering anything and everything. By everything  I literally mean every-single-thing. Thankfully I was accompanied by real adults who ordered a reasonable quantity of food. Despite our eyeing of the nachos (and everything else actually)  we settled on the cheese board  ramen bowl  tempeh \\bacon\\\" burger  and the salt baked cauliflower & meatball pizza.  Let's start with the cheese plate. I can finally relate to how it must feel when normal people eat vegetarian-ized meat. I was not clear whether this place was actually vegan vs vegetarian and for some reason was under the assumption this was actual cheese. The plate itself is gorgeous and generously loaded with 4 types of cheese  crispy kale  honey mustard  spicy mustard  and pesto dipping sauces  apple slices  a hard bread type-thing and carrot sticks. Now onto the shit you're actually interested in: the cheese. I was not expecting the waitress to say \\\"walnut cheese\\\"  (and then I forget the other kinds of cheese actually but all vegan). One soft with peppers and other spicy shit and 3 harder ones. They were alright but definitely not as good as actual cheese. The sauces were delicious  especially that pesto shit. Needless to say we ate the shit out of it anyway.  Second to arrive was the pizza. Crust was interesting  definitely not the type of crust I'm used to. This was one of the better offerings of the meal. The meatballs were tasty and I enjoyed the combo of flavors. Definitely not as good as regular pizza with a regular crust. Not unlike the rest of my life  perhaps my expectations are too high.  Shortly after the pizza  the tempeh burger made its way to our table. This was the ticket. Bun was soft. Tempeh was deliciously seasoned. Boyguh was escorted with crisp and thin sweet potato fries that could have been seasoned better and could have been more of themselves. I kept eyeing that last quarter on the plate and then kept counting the people at our table repeatedly disappointed that the math just didn't add up for me to have another wedge.   Finally the ramen decided to show up. Tons of broth with some brown noodles swimming with a large hunk of bok choy. Unfortunately (because it was relatively closer to me than some of the other things and therefore easier to access) this was just not good. Pretty flavorless but the flavors that were present weren't particularly tasty. This was a waste of space both on our table  on the bill  and most importantly  in my fucking stomach.   This place was good and seemed fresh and healthy. The service was great. I  however  feel there are better vegetarian places to try in Philly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My must stop every time I'm in the city!  I can't resist almost everything on the brunch menu.  My favorite item is the breakfast nachos with tofu scramble.  I'm always sure to leave with a bag full of baked goodies that even the non vegans love!! I tried the bikini burger today and it was so unique and delicious!   The customer service has always been consistently excellent.  The owner is usually there.  She's very personable and friendly.  Always a pleasure!   I'll be back soon!\n",
      "Why does this place not have 5 stars? Yes its pricey. Get over it. You get far more than what you actually pay for. With a relatively large location in Rittenhouse Square you can tell that P.S & Co. is really trying to charge you as little as they possibly can while still trying to pay the rent. In doing so  they are providing Philadelphia residents with outstanding product and I didnt even mention the service yet.   Upon my walking in I was greeted by 2 super friendly pleasent positive counter staff I really wish i could remember their names because I must say I have never been to a place with a friendlier waitstaff..and I've been to loads of places around the world in my time here on this planet. If you appreciate great quality  warm welcoming vibes  wonderfully sourced and executed food this is your place. I wish there were more places in the USA like P.S & Co. I no longer live in Philly but if I did I would make a special trip to come here.   I had the ramen noodles and super green tea. Excellence from point of entry to point of departure.  Keep up the good work.\n",
      "Stellar.   Equals or surpasses any Indian Pakistani Balti food I've ever had in London Britain.  For half the price of Tiffin.\n",
      "Chicken Tikka Masala.  I've never had such irresistible cravings for anything as I have for their chicken tikka masala.  If you haven't had it yet  you don't even know.   Also...  I live at 21st & Fitzwater (Graduate Hospital neighborhood).  They're in Fishtown on east girard.. and they DELIVER TO ME! yes yes yes!\n",
      "\n",
      "A friend surprised me with this visit.  Small but the food was very good.  A slow Thursday night and it was BYOB.  I definitely would eat here again.  I emjoyed the chicken vindaloo  spicy yes!\n",
      "great place...especially if you find tiffin just a bit too expensive.  ekta is almost identical in quality  but it will save you some money.  the only real difference is that the sauces are slightly less thick than tiffin's and the paneer is smaller and a bit less firm.  other than that  you can't tell the difference.  i always order takeout  and they are quick and nice  and always throw in a sample of something new to try.  tip them well.  they deserve it!\n",
      "I hadn't been to Ekta since it first opened a few years ago  and went this evening for an Indian food craving.   The food was  for the most part  excellent. My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed our entrees - I got chicken tikka masala and he got a lamb dish (which I can't recall how to spell). My chicken was delicious and the sauce was spiced beautifully. It had much more depth to it than lots of other tikka masala that I've had. The naan was warm and fresh. Minus one star for the vegetable samosas that we ordered as an appetizer - burning hot on the outside and freezing cold in the middle. The texture of samosa filling when it is cold is not appealing at all.   Service was friendly and efficient. Very solid option for Indian food in the area.\n",
      "I can't even comment on Ekta's food. Why? Because it still hasn't been delivered  nearly two hours after I ordered it. I've never had  or even heard of  such terrible service. I've called the restaurant to check on the progress (if you can call it that) and have been told each time that it will be another fifteen minutes. I'm so angry I didn't even cancel the order because I want to see how long it takes at this point.   Never again.\n",
      "Oh but seriously  Ekta is bomb.  You know how Philly can't really handle snow...or rain...or any weather pattern not consistent with Scottsdale  Arizona?   Well mega props to Ekta for having solid delivery of hot food in less than an hour on the quintessential dark and stormy night....When the rain smacks against your window like a cudgel wrapping against prison walls  there's nothing more comforting than a large hot bowl of spicy  freshly cut bindi masala.   The spice warms your insides  while the okra  tender  yet firm  swoops over your tongue. The garlic naan oddly cools your fire  calms your gastric juices  and appeases your tongue with its soft  fluffy elegance.\n",
      "Woah! Can't believe I haven't written a review of Ekta yet. I've been a regular for pretty much as long as they've been open. Great take out  and they have a small dining room now too. Great place for a simple date that doesn't feel like a big to-do. I have yet to find any other Indian food in the city that compares. Karma in Old City is a close 2nd.  My favorite way to order is while sitting in traffic on 95-S and then picking up after taking the Girard exit to avoid the rest of the traffic on 95. If traffic starts flowing and I have some time to wait in the take out area  I love watching them place the naan into the tandoori or pulling it out with the irons.\n",
      "cant keep me away from the malia kofta!!! heaven in my mouth. worlds apart from tiffin.\n",
      "I went to Hiro for lunch and got the special: $13 for ramen with salad and an appetizer. Great deal for the amount of food you get and how delicious it all is! I got the Vegetable Ramen and my brother got the Chicken Soy Ramen. We were the first people in just as the restaurant opened so we were served quickly and attentively. Unfortunately  we didn't know it was cash only but  no big deal  there's a bank right across the street! Overall  the food was great (one of the best ramen in Philly)  our server was super friendly  and the ambiance of the place seems perfect for a ramen house.\n",
      "Just ate the Inch of Heaven in about 3 minutes!!!!! Friegen' Unbelievable!!! Get here and eat!!!  Stopped in today for my second visit. Tried the Gates of Hell and it is just as amazing as the Inch of Heaven. The waitress here is very pleasant. Can't wait to go back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just had my first ramen here and I have zero complaints. I had the $13 lunch special which included salad  an appetizer and ramen. I asked the waitress who was very friendly for recommendations and she recommended the Hiro's inch of Heaven!! Great choice for a newbie like me. The broth was very flavorful and the noodles were perfect!  The lunch salad was good and for the appetizer I got the Karaage (fried chicken) and it was delicious. I was stuffed by the time I left but I will be back again!! Great service during the lunch rush hour\n",
      "Don't know what the big fuss is about  my first time here  and many more to come.  I ordered the vegetable ramen. It was delicious. The right amount of salt  oil  vegetables and other seasonings. The ramen it self was of traditional ramen noodles. Also the ramen was well plated or should I say well bowled? Lol.   The hostess and waitress are a pair of very attractive Asian ladies. The were very kind and stayed in eyesight if anything was needed. However  they are latently hungry for a tip. Typical for any hostess or waitress in a new restaurant.  5 stars and well earned!\n",
      "We've tried out quite a few ramen places in Philly (Nomnom  Terakawa  etc.)  but this is by far our favorite.  My fave is the black pig (burnt garlic oil  mmmMmmMm) with an extra egg  and my husband's is the gates of hell (spicy!).  Both are deeeeeelicious  the broth is incredibly deep and flavorful  the pork just melts in your mouth  egg is perfectly soft-cooked.  We're also a fan of the fried chicken--big pieces that are fried to perfection  yummmm.  Also  Dan  the server  is so incredibly friendly and nice--he's just adorable.  To top it all off  lunch special = $12 for a small salad  small appetizer  and a bowl of ramen--I'm sold!\n",
      "Ramen is solid and location is extra convenient for me (extra star for that). It's tucked away behind Milkboy so it's hard to notice. Very easy to get seating later in evening  which is when I went today. Amazingly good fried karaage chicken which you must get  piping hot and super flavorful with dipping sauce. I've tried almost all the ramen varieties here  usually in take-out form unfortunately  and the Hiro Heaven and Black Pig are my favorites. A bit on the saltier side overall  not a bad thing  just remember to hydrate well :)\n",
      "Great price for the quantity and quality! Looked and tasted really authentic! However I felt like they were a little heavy handed on the soy sauce (maybe because I don't consume salt as much) but other than the food tasted great! I got the lunch combo for $12 and got a good 3 course meal! The salad was delicious and the chicken ramen which unfortunately and to my suprise had more pork than chicken in it but also had lots of different veggies inside (exciting right?!)  the gyoza ( pork dumplings) on the other hand was drenched in soy! Would recommend if you like to discover new food! Also service was fast and our waitress was pretty nice!\n",
      "Some restaurants just need to meet a minimum standard of food quality to survive due to their geography.  Hiro Ramen House is one of those restaurants  located near the heart of Philadelphia next to several major academic institutions and hospitals.  Their food is in the $9-$12 range for a bowl of ramen which honestly had some redeeming parts but overarchingly came out to be about average.  I got a \\Gates of Hell \\\" which had all the heat and bite of a whimpering pup.  The noodle was miserable and in all likelihood from the corner asian supermarket.  Except for the egg which was very well made  the toppings were similarly lackluster and consisted of bamboo shoots  bean sprouts  and a sprinkle of green onion.  It truly seemed like they were present just for the sake of diversity in the bowl of ramen.  The broth was barely edging over acceptable and didn't have the deep rich flavor that all the top tier places have from simmering pork bones for literally half a day or longer.  The one redeeming factor for this ramen shop was the chasu  which was tender  lightly fatty  and had a strong  satisfying pork flavor.    Hiro Ramen House is a place you go to after a tiring day of work  when the idea of waiting in line for 2 hours at a restaurant makes you seriously consider just going to sleep hungry.  It gives you food that has the components of ramen  as much as McDonalds gives you food that has the components of burgers.  But heck it feels much better to sit in a place with actual decent decor rather than a fast food restaurant after a long day of work.\"\n",
      "The king is dead. Long live the king.   This place used to be my go-to ramen. Now after the newest menu changes  I don't think I can come in good conscience anymore.   No more happy hour. Except for the boys who came in after me. What what? Server playing favorites??  Major unbundling of ramen contents. If you like egg on your noodles  it's now an add on to ALL ramen. Kind of sad. Spicy is also another add on. It's a touch ridiculous.   No more employee discount. I can live with that.   But this place had a special point. A good-great ramen for about $10. Now it's hard to get away with a bill less than 15. The increase is enough to send me to Terakawa Ramen until something changes...\n",

      "It's fine dining  yes  but for this casual diner I preferred the brunch to dinner handsdown! No contest. Being in the industry  it was double the fun having parts of the meal served in the kitchen! And the service? En pointe and friendly. What an exquisite way to spend a snowy afternoon!!\n",
      "Expensive. Uneven. Best when clarity eg poached lobster with uni foam.More often unbalanced or over zealous combinations led to obfuscation or sludge: deconstructed guinea fowl~ pulled pork or amusee bouch - unrecognizable . No warniing that bird breast was smoked.Good wine list.Wooden service. No Michelin star here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had high expectations and although it was good  I was not wowed. For the price of brunch  I expected so much more. There was not a dish that I wanted to go back for seconds. However  the service was great. Everyone was very attentive!\n",
      "When one thinks of buffet  one thinks of Golden Corral or cheap Chinese food. Both hold places in the hearts and stomachs of wary travelers or persons needing large amounts of greasy food. This is not the buffet for them. This is the spread for people who have planned on eating here  not to be full beyond breathing  but to taste the most variety of delightful delicacies.  We went here after a week of planned eating to accommodate the large array of brunch edibles. After 2.5 hours of amazing food and service  we left filling full  not stuffed and happy to spend the money at this elevated \\buffet.\\\"   My recommendations  do not eat bread or any carbs. Find the food you would not normally eat or purchase at the store and go back for seconds or thirds. Juice is included  so ask for the server for each kind of juice in order to get the full experience.\"\n",
      "I came in for restaurant week with a coworker and the service was amazing  the food was ... alright.  First we came in and were seated in the small offset room that had some sort of tacky decor  but a great view of the park. Michael was our server and he was attentive and took time to explain each dish as it came out. The menu wasn't that descriptive at all  so his explanations were great in letting us know what was on each of our plates.  The meal started with delicious delicious bread and 2 types of butter. A goat butter w/ sashimi seasoning and then another one with some type of fancy salt.   After we weret reated to a chef's gift of 3 small mouth bites of different tasting h'orderves. One was some type of fish on a thin delicious blue corn chip  a foie gras macaroon  and a beef tartare thingie... The beef was the best  the foie gras threw me off  and i really enjoyed the thin blue corn chip.  My starter was the cold peach soup. It was cold  had hints of peach  but not quite what I was expecting. I think the texture was a lot more guspacho than I had anticipated  which was more a sweeter thinner expectation. It came with buttermilk (?) jelly which was interesting and some dried pepper that I did not really enjoy.  The main course was pork loin wrapped with bacon and baby carrots in some sort of reduction. This was good  there were 2 small servings of pork and bacon though  so I'm glad I filled up on the bread.  For dessert I went with the corn choice and I felt it was too much going on. There was a corn/apricot sorbet on corn polenta (similar to corn bread)  with pop corn and nitrogen frozen olive oil & thyme to be eaten with the pop corn  and some preserved apricot? It wasn't horrible  but I wasn't sure if I enjoyed it. Go with the Pear dessert instead. This comes with a 3 later cake of molasses jelly  chocolate and something else  much richer and delicious. The chef's take on a root beer float w/ pear... that was not that great.\n",
      "I went on a Sunday to celebrate my wife's birthday.  The food is wonderful.  There are many choices for appetizers and mains.  The seafood section is very generous with full size shrimp  a wide array of sushi and oysters.  There are full carving  stations of been and pork.  The eating area is a bit cramped.  The service is wonderfully attentive.  For me  a little too much  but for the type of restaurant it is  one should expect your napkin being folded immediately when you you get up.  In summary it is a great place to celebrate a special occasion.\n",
      "Pure excellence. Went for a birthday dinner in January  and finally getting around to writing a review. It's a little tricky finding the entrance the first time  due to it being a part of Rittenhouse Hotel. But the concierge was friendly (he must deal with wandering patrons all the time) and pointed us in the right direction.   Lacroix had everything that is desired and necessary for a great dining experience. Everything from the greeting  decor  views  and most importantly  the food.   Service was great  funky and elegant plates with yummy food inside of it. We were lucky enough to also sit at the Chef's table for dessert  after already a decadently delicious majority of the meal  which was a real treat.   foie gras was excellent  and wine list/sommelier was helpful.  The meal was a while ago  but I just remember this blur of delicious food  fantastic service  excellent decor  and memorable experience.   I've also heard that their brunch is amazing  so planning on returning for that! magnifique!\n",
      "Yup  the brunch is to die for.... and at $56 per person it is an incredible deal. Ritz brunch buffets are typically $75pp (at least in Cali)  and they don't compare. Lacroix's setup (half the buffet is in the kitchen!) is very fun and unique  and selection is incomparable. The cold app table was like a buffet of amuse bouches - assortments of very complex and meticulously prepared bites - I've never seen anything like them at a buffet. My favorites were definitely the caviar and gnocchi. I'll be stuffed and happy for a long time.   Why not 5 stars? The service was weirdly lacking. Had to beg to place drink orders and to have champagne poured. There was a sweet woman often nearby gathering plates  but for some reason she wasn't allowed to pour champagne- a little frustrating though nothing another mound of caviar cant fix. :)\n",
      "Adding the San Diego and Savannah (sans mayo) to my list of favorites from here! They've become my go-to sandwiches. I did notice that a few sandwiches have come off the menu  so hoping these two are here to stay!   Tip: Ask for the Savannah grilled so the brie is nice and melted!\n",
      "Love this spot and so happy the moved further down fairmount Ave so it's closer to me!!   Great mix of classic sandwiches  as well as unique but equally as delicious options. Super nice staff as well. Recently I couldn't decide between the buffalo chicken panini and the jerk chicken panini  but decided to go with the jerk chicken since had an interesting addition of pineapple which was the perfect amount of sweet to the spiciness of the delicious sauce.  Great selection of salads  too  with a monthly chef's special! Bakery display looked amazing with cookies  cupcakes  etc. Definitely want to go back for one of the huge cupcakes I saw.   SUPER friendly staff  I asked for a bunch of suggestions and they were super willing to chat. Not a lot of seating but some options for both inside and outside seating!\n",
      "The bagal Here was plain but with large volume  you could choose which content you want. But basically  not so surprising.\n",
      "\n",
      "My mom and I went looking for lunch were directed to walk along Fairmount as there are a number of cafes there. We ended up stopping at Rybread  and we were certainly glad. The food here is amazing! I normally don't like to buy sandwiches when I'm out because honestly  it's not that hard to put stuff on bread  you can do it at home. But these sandwiches are WORTH IT. Amazing variety  super fresh ingredients  stuffed full of lots of tasty things. I only wish I actually lived closer so I could go more often!  We sat outside at the patio in the back which is small  but super homey. If you're in the mood for a great and easy lunch  definitely stop here.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Whoa!!! Ryebread Cafe is so great!! I almost hope more people don't find out about it since the wait times are very reasonable and although they are busy there are always free seats. Big fan!  They have a really cool geographically-themed sandwich/panini menu which accounts for most of the food options. There are 3 vegetarian sandwiches and I have tried the Sante Fe (grilled portobello  squash  eggplant  caramelized onion  pesto) and the Hollywood (hummus  cucumber  red onion  shaved carrot). Both were delicious!   The inside has a great feel and there is outdoor seating out front and in a rear patio. Very friendly staff. Since I am quite sick of the crowds and long waits at Mugshots this is a really great alternative for a quick weekend breakfast!\n",
      "Just dropped in for a little late Sunday lunch after reading all the positive Yelp reviews and once again Yelp did not let me down.  Even though like many a good places... you could walk right by Rybread and never even notice it  this place serves up a mean sandwich.  Highly recommend the untoasted Napa sandwich!!! I went sans prosciutto to keep it a little lighter but I think next time I will give it a try wit'. Enjoy!\n",
      "Good  safe  reliable  local place. Not special but is totally satisfactory. Coffee is drip  and just passable.\n",
      "I really felt like I stepped back into a cafe in Paris. I met a friend for breakfast just as they opened and enjoyed a delicious and authentic pain au chocolat and an espresso.  Counter service was easy and quick.  We were left to our own devices to gab and catch up.  It was wonderful.  I will be back.  Now that I know the pain au chocolat is great  I can't wait to go back and see how the macarons measure up!\n",
      "Te times I have been here I've spent at least 10$ on macarons. They are priced 1.75 each so you don't get too many for 10$. The earl gray chocolate macarons taste like a biscotti  tea biscuit. Strawberry is my favorite and lemon poppyseed is up there too. They are all wonderful and chilled so you know they are fresh. The next time I go back I will try new flavors to see what else they have to offer. The coffee is also very good. Service is okay they all have a French accent so it's fun to be in a new atmosphere. Hope this helps you\n",
      "I used to be anti-macaron. No more.  After pretty much every macaron experience in my life turning out horridly  some friends recommended this place to me. Unfortunately  every time I visited they seemed to be out. Your best bet is to visit early on a weekday  when I finally caught them they had guava & coffee. Instantly fell in love  will definitely be back for more.\n",
      "Different qualities on different days. On a very good day like the past experience I just had the macarons wrre fresh and my favorite flavor from here every time would be chocolate! Chocolate never failed on me but their coffee can sometimes taste really good but sometimes when its not fresh the shell does get cracky and the inside is def not soft. During different seasons they have special flavors such as egg nog or pepperiment and recently a new flavor they seem to have is the Jasmine Green Tea and as a green tea fan that was not a disappointment. Even though I have bad experiences at Miels I still come back over and over again because not every pastry is a dissappointment.  Miel also served a mini fruit tart and mini dark chocolate tart even though they are $1.95  a piece and kind of pricey a little tart they are tempting and does get me to get one during my visits every time.  Mocha would def not be a recommendation to get as a drink because it is not sweet and simply taste like plain coffee.\n",
      "Miel is one of the go-to bakeries for tiramisu cakes and fruit tarts for my office. Not only are they quite lovely  but delicious as well. The macarons are alright  and it's nice that Miel has a large selection of flavors.   My husband and I came to get pastries and coffee for breakfast one Saturday morning  but I guess we were too late at 10:30am since their pastry case was pretty empty.   Plenty of seating inside and serves La Colombe.\n",
      "The service is terrible. Consistently. I go in there because I love the peach nectar iced tea and the macaroons  but  seriously  the service is awful. They are either consistently understaffed  clueless  or rude. There have been times when I've been in there and the service has been so bad that I've had to prevent myself from telling the employees what they should be doing. And there is no sense of urgency and zero organization. I would come here so much more if I knew that when I did  I wouldn't want to tear my hair out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I discovered a lovely french pastry shop in the Rittenhouse area. What a shame that I didn't find it sooner. Walking through the doors my eyes quickly turned to the pastry counter  rows of french desserts including my favorite macarons. Having skipped lunch I decided to treat myself to dessert not one but two. I opted for a latte with a lemon tart and rose water macarons.  The latte was perfect washing down the bites of the lemon tart.  The rose macaron tasted like many Persian desserts which use rose water. It was also a perfect macaron: chewy inside with a slight crispy exterior. As I sat there indulging myself  many came in to buy their daily bread and dessert. Seems like I am the only one in town that didn't know about this place.\n",
      "Bought 4 macaroons: salted caramel and pistachio for me   rose and some combination of chocolate and passion fruit for a friend. Also had a cup of the house tea - Jasmine  green tea  and something else. $7.25 for the whole shebang. There were two guys working the store - One manning the register and delivering drinks to the tables  the other explaining their offerings to customers. He gave me the full run through of their macarons and seemed quite knowledgeable about the pastries in general. The register dude was a little less extroverted  but polite. Overall  I had a pleasant experience.\n",
      "We just moved in around the corner from Miel  and when my boyfriend's mom--who was helping us move in and is a sucker for all things that are touted as special--caught a glimpse of Miel  she was sold.  Every time she walked by  she had to stop by and buy something.  Or ten somethings.  And then leave it for us.  I  protesting her ridiculousness  refused to touch the pastries.  We're only two of us.  We don't even have any groceries yet.  I'm trying to lose weight (as always).  And you're bringing us a bag full of pastries?!  So I ate a yogurt instead and glared disdainfully at the pretty packages  while she recounted the stories the owners had told her about them.  But after my boyfriend's mom left  I couldn't help myself.  I took a bite out of the multicolored cake  thinking it must look way prettier than it tastes.  But it was amazing.  My left hand had to force the fork out of my right so I would stop digging in.  The next day I tried a couple bites from the muffins.  They were tasty  but it's hard to do anything really special with muffins.  That night I tried two of her most recent purchases  one of which was supposed to be some recipe saved from someone's grandmother who died in the Holocaust.  And it's a good thing it was saved  because that cake  and the one that accompanied it  were some of the most delicious confections I've had.  Even the tiny berries that came on top of some of the pastries were delicious (unlike the ones I bought at the farmer's market last weekend).  I haven't actually stepped into the store or paid for any of their goods  and I don't know what any of the cakes I tried are called.  I didn't have the macarons  but I don't like macarons anyway.  I just suggest you go and indulge.  That way I won't be the only fatty on the block.\n",
      "Came here on a Friday evening. The restaurant was fairly packed and we were lucky to get a reservation.  Started the meal off with the escargot and seared scallops. Both were excellent dishes and set our expectations even higher. I was quite disappointed they did't have the seared foei gras that night.  The main course is where it all fell apart. I ordered the duck confit  and it was just bad. The duck was overly salty. The duck was also overly fatty  and the side dishes did no saving grace. Totally not worth the price.   To top it all off  considering the prices  why is this place cash only? Do you expect me to walk around with $100 bills in my wallet?\n",
      "The food here is among the best I've had in Philly.  My gf and I each ordered the $65 tasting menu (which was not on the regular menu)...I had only heard about it from reading reviews on Yelp.  Despite being expensive  it was phenomenal  and the portions were massive for a tasting menu.  The service was pretty good  as was the atmosphere.  As a very small restaurant with seating capacity of about 30 or so people  I wouldn't recommend for large groups.  However  if you're going on a date  and food is of top priority  this should be near the top of your list.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a unique restaurant in that their menu is a 5 course prix fixe menu that changes on a weekly basis. It's $45 per person. The dishes are small and dainty  but it does fill you up after 5 courses. The only thing I didn't like was that there is only one option (as in you don't have a say) with some of the courses. But for other courses  they'll let you choose between 2 different options. I had a chocolate mousse dessert here that was probably the best dessert I've ever had in my life. If your mouth can have an orgasm- this dessert gave me one. I also loved the cozy and intimate atmosphere- the entire restaurant only seats 26 people. Great place to come with a date  but not so much with a group of friends.\n",
      "After careful research  my party of 6 choose Pumpkin for our NYE dinner. I have been here multiple times before and always been impressed with the fresh flavors and execution of the dishes. The $50 tasting menu for this event was well thought out although some courses shined more than others. Here is the breakdown:  As per usual  Pumpkin nailed the opening soup. This particular sweet potato was a perfect combination of flavors and reminded me of the creamy winter vegetable soup I dream of. There was ground up pumpernickel to add some texture to this rich bowl of goodness. The next course was an individual seared scallop which was somewhat of a letdown. Mine was not seared as nicely as others at the table and although truffles were a component  there were very few if any. For an additional $10 I added a sweetbreads course which drew mixed reviews from my party. I have only had sweetbreads once before  but these were less tender and more chewy. The main course brought me back to where I usually am at Pumpkin with a perfectly cooked duck breast. See my picture  it was perfect and complemented nicely with the crunchy grilled endive. I finished with cheesecake which was better than average but not that memorable (or maybe the gratuitous amount of BYOBing had set in at this point).  The service was 5 stars as per usual. Someone broke a glass and it was no big deal. I understand that restaurants make their money on these gimmick event nights but overall for my $60 plus tip I had hoped for a little more at a BYOB (a single scallop as a course in particular was a let down). Nonetheless I highly recommend this little neighborhood graduate hospital South Street joint and make sure you do not miss whatever soup they are offering!\n",
      "My sweetheart had a pork chop that was overcooked.  I had fish  which was a mighty small portion for a lot of $$.  Service was good and the ambiance is sweet.  Glad we checked it out  as I've walked by a zillion times.  But we won't be back.  Too many great restaurants in Philly where you can get a great meal  and a bigger bang for our buck.\n",
      "This small  almost nook of a restaurant pride themselves on preparing full gourmet meals - emphasizing local fresh meats and produce.  And the tiny interior has been very carefully designed as a marriage of homey intimacy with upscale dining.  The decor signals romantic casual dining  but draws a dress-for-dinner crowd (there is no jacket requirement).  If only the food were as piquant as the setting.  The menu is undoubtedly gourmet. It changes on a daily basis to reflect the chef's recent shopping.  Bravo.  But what does not change is the penchant of the chef to destroy his preparations with salt.  I had the saltiest rissotto in memory here.  And therein lies the fundamental problem with this romantic BYOB   the basic ideas are truly of-the-moment  but the finish lacks  well  finish.    A creative chef has no room to mask technical deficiencies  and seasoning is what is unmasked at Pumpkin.  The ingredients and the recipes promise far more than what is being delivered.  Not all dishes are deserving of this somewhat harsh criticism  but gourmet fare cannot afford to be hit or miss  especially at prices rivaling even stalwart local gourmet cuisine.   The waitstaff is entirely average at best  giving a somewhat affected performance that actually interferes with rather than embellishes the dining experience.  Being aloof about the food is unjustified  and spilling water on me and my food is simply unacceptable.  The menu is priced aggressively high  with a seating running easily into the $40-$50 range (including and depending on the wine(s) you bring).  But then  that also increases the odds that your dinner companions at other tables  who will be sitting on your elbows  if not in your ear  share your values for a dining experience.  I would not discourage spending an evening at Pumpkin - it is a bright spot in what seems to be a neighborhood renaissance.  And the basic ideas that are being nurtured in this fresh genuinely gourmet restaurant may yet blossom. But for now  this is a night of adventure  rather than a regular visit.\n",
      "Overpriced- food was okay. The waitress was wayyyy over the top and loud in the small  quiet restaurant. Will not be back.\n",
      "Place was very cramped. We went for our anniversary and sat inches from another table. Service was exceptional  but we felt like we were being rushed through our meal. Food was pretty good. Not exceptional  but good.\n",
      "My fav restaurant in Philly! I went for my birthday dinner and was very impressed... Great food  great service... And my hubs and I were the last ones in the place and not once did we feel rushed. I will be back again!\n",
      "only giving 3 stars because the products taste good - if you ever get them. I stopped in Saturday around 3  it was slow. maybe three   four tables and no one waiting at the counter. I asked for the avocado smoothie with 2 energy shots (which was $2 up charge. that's fine) order a panini as well go go and sat waiting about 20 minutes before even getting the \\smoothie\\\". I get handed my drink .. which is a Luke warm drink  100% liquid. not a smoothie at all. it had chunks of avocado in it still and about 8 ice cubes. a girl next to me was handed the same thing  because they we're blended together. I did not receive the 2 energy shots I paid for .. or my money back. and by the time I got my sandwich I almost walked out because I was late for work. sandwich was good but I was annoyed by the time I got it.\"\n",
      "There's a reason they have the worst fuel rating of all locations. They mess orders up  they are not accommodating  and it takes over 2 hrs to get food delivered 4 blocks away. Also  the presentation of the food is always awful.\n",
      "I want to like Fuel. I've been a bunch of times because it's close to work and healthy. I love that they display the calorie count on all of their food items.  However the decor is cheesy  the curtains look like they came from a prop shop from a high school and the ambiance is comparable to an 80s discotheque.  The service is fair. There have been times when I've been attended to and other times where I've waited at the counter for five minutes because the cashier was just hanging out with the dudes at the grill.  There are healthier and more efficient places in the area to go to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fuel has a great concept.   I've gotten take out here a few times and I've been satisfied both times.  Its a great option on more of the healthy side.    People should really read the menu before they go ordering crazy thinking everything is crazy good for you.  Keep in mind wraps and such are not added to the caloric count on the menu (gotta read the fine print!)  The music and the videos on the television are kinda strange but I'm here for the food so I don't pay much mind to that.   Overall I really like it here for a quick  reasonable healthy option.  I'm excited for the Arch street location to finally open.  Does anyone know when that is going to be?  Plus - Fuel is right by 12th street gym so good meal option afterwards.  Minus - Fuel is not open at their other center city location (on Arch) (near my work/apt)\n",
      "I have eaten here several times  and everytime I have got great tasting fresh food! The paninis are excellent and they can veganise anything on their menu  without compromising the taste. Service is very prompt as well. Very consistent and great tasting food!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have yet to find a smoothie I didn't enjoy. Do yourself a favor and order a Green Tea Matcha. For the gym rats out there  the options with added protein taste quite good.  I can't comment on the food offerings because I have not tried them yet but I will say the service is great and the workers at the register always have a smile on their faces. Some of that may be attributed to the enjoyably eclectic playlist blasting music throughout the shop.\n",
      "I wanted to get take-out from the area and was feeling something healthy and light. My first experience at Fuel when I got a sandwich was pretty good so I thought why not give it another try!?! I got two orders -it was a busy day for me so I wanted to save the 2nd order for dinner :) I got the Shrimp and Avocado Salad for lunch. I was not a fan of this. I would give 2 stars for this. The lemon vinaigrette dressing had no flavor. It tasted like an \\appetizer dressing\\\" rather than a \\\"lunch dressing\\\" if you get what I mean.... The salad overall was lacking in flavor as well. I added craisins  sunflower seed  and feta chesse at home when I was halfway done. The avocadaos were not fresh either. I was so disappointed in this salad and will never get it again.  However  the Grilled chicken in a wheat wrap was decent. I think the balsamic reduction gave the wrap a nice end to the taste. The chicken was tender  artichokes were slightly salty but came in an abundant amount  I could not taste the tomato spread that  much..but the wrap was nicely wrapped and my dinner did not end up messy.  So the overall vibe I get from Fuel everytime I come here for food or drinks...it's very unique. I like it b/c I don't feel like I swallowed a hamburger and feel gross. You'll def feel light and healthy after a full meal  but I am never fully satisfied b/c there's no good grasp to the taste. Will I ever go back again? Yes most likely-but I will keep on ordering something different until I find that GOOD meal !\"\n",
      "Oh my gosh  this place conned me into believing they sold Acai bowls for cheap. What they gave me was not a real acai bowl. The acai base was icy and tasted like high fructose corn syrup. There wasn't any trace of real acai in the bowl. It was like a slurpee but with fruit on it. Gross! Don't lie to your customers! You should go to a place that sells real acai bowls and taste the difference!\n",
      "Super authentic hole-in-the-wall breakfast place with a Latin vibe. The music is literally just a Sonos speaker plugged into the wall.. very casual and everyone is very friendly. As for the food  the eggs are probably the best I've had. They prepare them secretly that you have to find out for yourself by visiting.  Chill vibe  good company  and reasonable pricing. Over all a great place to visit for Sunday brunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly and delightfully making my through their whole menu. As a self-proclaimed \\sandwich guy\\\" there are a few baseline requirements to win my full support: excellent bread (yes)  sound construction (definitely  these guys hand craft with LOVE)  and excellent/unexpected condiment enhancements (hoison? miso? masala jam? yup.).  This is a great spot to grab breakfast or lunch- would highly recommend the So Long Sal  which tastes exactly like an italian sub should but has some fun twists  the Surfer  and the Pho-gie. They're also really quick with a helpful suggestion if the options are just too much to handle.\"\n",
      "Middle Child has a cozy  authentic feel with quality food at a great price. Definitely recommend.\n",
      "Food is really well done  obviously they care about quality. There's enough new Orleans stuff in here to warrant something a little southern. My pitch: a beignets with cream cheese icing instead of powdered sugar. You call it the Beign Franklin.  So happy this place is doing well. Will be back.\n",

      "Great spot  it really is  and I say this as a middle child. I was freezing and wanted something warm and boom  there I was with an excellent Reuben with special \\sawce.\\\" As that brand new grill gets broken in  these will only get better...\"\n",

      "I've been wanting to go to Jerry's since my birthday in early January.  Due to all the snow  was unable to get there until today.  Love the atmosphere  service is very so-so.  And  the food  for the most was the biggest disappointment.  I ordered the Eggs Jerry  to receive two potato pancakes the size of a half dollar with over cooked poached eggs that were cold and not runny.  The server never checked on us once or even when she cleared the plates did she ask if we enjoyed ourselves.  The smoked trout salad was yummy!  My father ordered buttermilk pancakes  they were okay  I was still starving from my prison sized portion  so I ate a pancake.  Sabrina's pancakes are better!\n",
      "It was a quintessential snapshot of summer's end. The quiet  impending death of another warm season in Philadelphia was so vivid you could almost hear it.  Tuesdee night. 9:30PM.  74 Degrees Fahrenheit.  Every window and door in the place was wide open.  And there I sat  my wife and two of my dearest man friends sitting together at a table  smiling like dopes and watching scores of dried up leaves inch along the sidewalk.  We had already eaten a fantastic meal that night prior to leaf-watching -  at Han Dynasty  to be specific. We were perfectly full and content. We had no room for beer.  No room for food.  But I couldn't justify going home without stopping for dessert.  Jerry's dessert menu had imprinted itself on my brain  heart and stomach again - just like it did the last time I ate there - and I felt it proper to let my friends and loved ones experience the enchantment  too.  We whispered three words into the ether: The. Blueberry. Cobbler.  I dare say it's my favorite dessert in the entire city right now (and I live directly above a small-batch  highly reputable ice cream shop  mind you).  Being swept up by dialed-in charm of the place  we felt it necessary to order the rest of the dessert menu while we were at it. Plus a few cocktails. And a bowl of soup.  All food and drink items were devoured with little-to-no conversation  save for a few well-placed laughs. From the shit-eating grins on our faces  owner Bill Proud seemed delighted to walk up to our table  shake our hands  and share with us that he  too  was heading home - with a paperbag full of blueberry cobbler in his hands  no less.  The night. The food. The drinks. The city.  In that moment  they were unanimously agreed upon as 'fucking perfect'.\n",
      "I think if you live in the neighborhood it's pretty adequate. But don't travel here. Bad service  food is okay. Great interior  but you can't eat that  can you.\n",
      "Bar tender was too busy talking with the obnoxious girls flirting with him to serve the rest of the bar.  Was fed up after a single drink and gladly walked my company elsewhere.\n",
      "What a wonderful addition to the neighborhood!  Jerry's was absolutely delicious and very cozy.  The cozy dark-wood joint is set just far enough off the beaten path that it can remain a neighborhood spot  which is great in a part of town that's full of destinations that attract tons of visitors from other parts of the city.  The food was delicious:  - House-made meatballs were served in a cast iron skillet soaking in a bath of delicious tomato sauce.  They were fall-apart tender and melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Just be sure to save some bread to scoop up that sauce.  - Moules Frites came out in a huge heaping portion with a mound of shoestring fries piled on top  with a pool of beer broth below.  The mussels themselves were tender  plump and perfect (which is not all that common  unfortunately).  The fries were killer  and the broth was absolutely delicious.  My only complaint  and it's a small one: the bread to dip in the broth was decidedly lifeless  any kind of crisp on the outside would have made a big difference.  - The Deluxe Burger was fantastic.  The beef was perfectly cooked  the cheese was a crumbled mound of salty  sharp cheddar that really lit up the burger.  Topped with a thick slab of amazing tomato on a buttery brioche  with a side of those shoestring fries.  Extremely satisfying.  I will 100% be back for that escargot with jumbo lump crab... and those pickle-brined wings... and the chicken and bowties in truffle broth... and the french dip...\n",
      "Excellent brunch spot.  Very hipster scene here  both service and food were on point.  Def worth checking out.  Didn't have one  but place is def known for their Bloody Mary's.  Portions were on the smaller side  & bit on pricier side but comes with trendy place like this.  Def a top notch spot for this up and coming neighborhood.\n",
      "So disappointed. Long wait  didn't have turkey sausage & decided not to tell me until my French toast came out. And the french toast was soggy.   Just don't waste your time.\n",

      "3 years later and I am still going to give Jerry's a solid 5-stars in my book. Not only for having my favorite Bramble in the city  but because of their tremendous service over the last few years. This update comes years after having been for two back-to-back brunches when they first reopened (a new take on the old Jerry's Bar) back in 2013. Since then I have been back for countless brunches and happy hours as this is staple in our rotation of trusty neighborhood spots. I could go on about food and cocktails  but this review is solely based on service.   Back in 2014 we hosted my boyfriends sisters' 21st birthday dinner at Jerry's after having been vigorously consuming beers at nearby Barcade. In planning the party  Jerry's never pushed the idea of having a more limited menu than their daily offerings and did not ask for any contracts signed in advance of having 20+ people in their loft dining area. We showed up in a slightly drunken manner - there was chaos surrounding who wanted to sit next to whom - everyone wanted to buy shots for the birthday girl and yet despite the loudness of the McCormick clan  our servers handled everything flawlessly. Dishes all arrived at the same time  cocktails were perfectly made in large batches  and the checks were split with ease (annoying to do with a party that size  we know). They truly helped make the birthday plans special.  Earlier this year  I was at Jerry's for a typical Sunday jazz brunch and ordered the Eggs Jerry. What arrived at the table was not eggs benedict and from the confused look on my face our server clearly knew that there was a mixup. She quickly returned with eggs benedict and apologized for the mistake  no biggie. The problem however was when I cut into the eggs and realized that they were completely hard set (a heartbreaking moment for any eggs benedict lover). I'm not normally one to send a dish back  but did so only asking for the eggs to be recooked - not only did she bring back delicious and properly cooked poached eggs  she took the entire dish off of our check. It was a nice gesture for the delayed brunch.  This past weekend however  was the caketopper in service. After having dropped my business card in a fishbowl to win a private happy hour about a month and a half ago  I was contacted by Jerry's just a few weeks later informing me that I had won! I immediately reached out to the bar to let them know that I would absolutely take them up on the offer and asked if there was a way that they would allow the generosity of a private room for happy hour to be extended into a fundraiser for my upcoming participation in the Susan G. Komen 3-Day walk. From there  Jerry's (but mainly their event planner) went to town helping us to throw an amazing charity fundraiser in their gorgeously appointed courtyard that mixed our love for great cocktails with a chance to see friends at the close of Labor Day weekend all while raising money for the 3-Day. The entire staff on the day of the event was exceptionally helpful - Jerry's absolutely went above and beyond my expectations of throwing a little end of summer happy hour and everyone had a blast. Dan made terrific cocktails  the kitchen provided us with delicious dips and grilled veggies  Liz was hustling with all of the drink orders rolling through - and all was handled effortlessly.  Whether you are throwing a birthday dinner  having a fancy jazzy brunch  meeting friends for happy hour  or hosting a charity event - Jerry's can handle it all with style and grace. I know  because I've experienced them all and that's what keeps us coming back.\n",
      "I really want this place to be \\great \\\" but after two visits I have to say it is just ok. The atmosphere is nice and the interior design work is tops  but those are about the best attributes Jerry's is offering in my opinion. The prices are very high for what they are offering for both food and drink. Ordered the mussels and they came out refrigerator cold. Sent back for a fresh hot batch and we are certain they tossed in the microwave to quick heat. They were bad. My French dip had zero flavor. Need a new au jus. The service was average at best. Our server did not have much to offer and seemed more interested in pushing us through our meal.   I hope they read the review and work on improvements.  As I mentioned  I'd love to make this a regular spot.\"\n",
      "My partner and I split the vegetarian platter and left stuffed! Delicious food  very kind and attentive staff.  Will help you make decisions on ordering and certainly won't take advantage of you. Will definitely be back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seriously one of the most pleasant dining experiences I have had in a while. Smiley himself is a true gem and the food was DELICIOUS. Had so much that I am eating it for lunch again today - and I can't wait! Please recommend to everyone you know in Manayunk  don't want to lose this place!\n",
      "Couldn't say it better than the below poster. Excellent food  service and prices.  Located where Mugshots used to be (RIP)  one of my coworkers had been raving about this place  in particular the falafel and of course the very kind owner.  Went with my pre-wife and we shared beef gyro (carved) pita  falafel pita and hummus plate. Everything was extremely fresh (I concur on the crisp lettuce) well seasoned and just plain delicious.  A lot of food as well and complimentary baklava. We took our leftovers home (I wrapped the two remaining bites of my gyro - it's that good)  I highly recommend this place and you'll definitely walk out with a smile. I think this spot is still relatively unknown and I very rarely post reviews. This is a unique spot to Manayunk and I will be referring all of my friends as I really want the restaurant to succeed - because the owner deserves it and of course for my selfish appetite!\n",
      "Came to Smiley's after reading other Yelp reviews  and I was not disappointed! I ordered the beef gyro platter to go  and the portion was well worth the money. Myself and another person split the meal  and there was still some left over. The gyro meat is cut off of a huge slab right in front of you. Don't let its appearance put you off: it's delicious. The rice is delicious and doesn't feel heavy or greasy like some that I've had from other establishments in the past. With the platter you also get a huge helping of hummus and a bag full of delicious pita  and a little salad on the side. I'll definitely be back here to try some of the other menu items. I definitely need to try the baklava.\n",
      "This place really isn't that good. The atmosphere is sweet  but the food is mediocre at best. I'm always disappointed when I type in middle eastern and this pops up as the best available  it's definitely not.\n",
      "Do yourself a favor and order up a beef gyro platter. It comes with so much food you could probably feed two  but you're going to want to hoard it all for yourself. Plus you get enough hummus and pita to bath in -- win win.\n",
      "A hidden Jem right off Main Street!  It's a no frills place but the food is fresh  healthy and reasonably priced. The smoothie my boyfriend got was so good he took another one for the road. I had the falafel platter and  it was awesome. I will definitely be coming back!\n",
      "I would start listing my favorite things about Smiley's  but the list would be impossibly long. New York has incredible middle eastern food  but this is  bar none  the best I've ever had in my life. Best chicken schwarma  best seasoned falafel  best (and most massive) vegetarian platters. The portions are huge  and did I mention delicious? Two very hungry people could make a great meal out of one serving. I've had the garlic chicken- shredded white meat with many optional sauces  making each bite a different taste experience  as well as the vegetarian platter  which was so gigantic that my very hungry friend and I still had two containers to take home. Everything tasted fresh and delicious. The service is also five stars. Smiley and Mrs. Smiley go out of their way to make sure you are charmed and satisfied  whether that's sending over free baklava or extra smoothies so that everyone can have a try.  I'm happy to say I'm a Smiley's regular  and will sing their praises to whoever will listen.\n",
      "Affordable  amazing service  and a great location. I loved grabbing dinner here with my husband for a quick date out. I would have tried everything on the menu if I could have  but make sure you at least try the baklava. :) will definitely be coming back.\n",
      "My initial thoughts of a seemingly lonely Friday night sans plans were brightened by an invite to Lolita.  I had heard good things about this Mexican BYO(T) and always wanted to check it out  so I brought the tequila and my friend brought the gift certificate.  My friend was told they don't do reservations on a Fri night so I was a little worried about getting a table at 8 pm  but luckily I only had to wait about 5 min. As I looked around the busy restaurant at the other tables  I felt like a cheap asshole since there were bottles of Patron on almost every table  but hey  times are tough  and the truth is I've never felt justified in spending 50 bucks on a bottle of liquor. Anyways  our friendly server promptly turned our bottle of Cuervo 1800 into a pitcher of margaritas-- not the best I've ever had  but still pretty good.   I had a difficult time deciding what to order because I am an avid lover of Latin food in general and every item on the menu sounded extremely appealing. But I had been craving steak  so I went with the carne asada  My friend went with the vaca which was the braised shortrib dish and for an appetizer we got the chips and guac. The guac was good  though again not the best I've had  but I did appreciate the textural variation that the jicama added. However  our entrees were OUTSTANDING. I was very impressed. Everything about my dish was delicious and full of flavor. My steak was perfectly cooked also.  My friend's shortrib was equally as flavorful. I wanted him to try my dish so badly but due to his allergy to bananas  that yummy  creamy plantain sauce could have turned into an ER visit.  Overall service was great- our server was very friendly and attentive  prices to portion sizes were reasonable  atmosphere with exposed brick walls and closely spaced tables was mediocre  and food was excellent. I can't wait to come back and try more things on the menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mmmmm  Lolita.  Light of my life  fire of my loins...  Okay  maybe that was an exaggeration  but I firmly believe the first paragraph of Lolita is one of the most magical things ever written and just wanted to share that.  Anyway  on with the review!  I went to Lolita for the second time last weekend with my boyfriend to meet his parents.  This is the sort of event that normally sends me into a nervous fit  but I kept my cool most of the day because I was so freaking excited to eat here!  Whether you want to call it Mexican or neo Mexican or Mexican influenced American  I don't care.  The food is seriously yummy.  We split some guacamole and fundido for an appetizer.  I would have eaten the guac with a spoon  but I was trying to make a good impression.  They all loved the fundido.  We also got a pitcher of blood orange margarita.  Boyfriend had the waitress bring me a glass with sugar and poured me some before adding tequila.  He said it would go really well with my meal.  At first I though a virgin margarita was kind of silly  but he was right.  Delicious.  It was such a good compliment to the spiciness of my salmon.  Everybody loved their meals.  The bittersweet chocolate pecan bread pudding I had for dessert was astoundingly good.  The flourless chocolate cake Boyfriend got was irrationally dry (seriously  there's no flour  how is it dry?).   I would eat hear all the time if I could afford it  but I can't afford it.  At all.  Minus a star for price  Lolita.  My sin  my soul...\n",
      "BYOT  ftw.   A friend's parent took us all out for dinner to Lolita  and we had an absolute blast. The margaritas weren't too strong when they made them for us  but we just added some more tequila after the pitcher was brought back to our table!  It's this tiny restaurant  where you sit  enjoy the food  and enjoy the company that you are with. Size doesn't seem an issue when the smells  atmosphere  and food offered at Lolita are at your leisure. My dish was so well-flavored  I couldn't stop eating it the whole time that we were there. I can safely say that the whole group had a great time  highly recommended for a fun and delicious night on the town.\n",
      "Wonderful from start to finish! This was my only dinner in Philly but it was handpicked by a very special someone so I know it must be good compared to a lot of other restaurants in the area.  We had the pera margaritas - delish  but hard to distinguish all the flavors.  To start  we had the traditional guac and 4-hour pork carnitas. The guac was solid  the carnitas were amazing.   He had the carne asada  I had the tamarind short ribs. The carne asada was more like a thick steak than your traditional thinly sliced carne asada. The sauce was bright in both color and flavor  and the presentation was beautiful.  The short ribs were fantastic. So tender. You could literally just pull it apart with a fork. And again  beautiful presentation.  We didn't have room for dessert so I can't speak to that.  Service was great - no complaints there.  The only awful thing is that it's cash only - which makes no sense to me given their prices - but I'm sure they have their reasons.\n",
      "Food was pretty good and service was excellent.  Was very loud inside but we had an outdoor table which was much quieter and better for people watching.   Had the blood orange margarita which was just OK. Too sweet for our taste. Maybe should have stuck with the traditional lime\n",
      "Very tender Carne Asada!  Well executed!  All the ingredients blended well without overpowering the flavor of the excellent tenderloin.  On a trip by myself so I didn't bring any tequila  but all the margarita mixes look great.  BYO and CASH only!\n",
      "oh  lolita... i just visited you for the first time on friday nite  and  much like the nabokov nymphet for which you are presumably named  i find myself smitten and longing to see you again. soon....i hope!  the guac? delish. the BYOT factor? love it. but what really sparked my love affair was how wonderfully vegetarian friendly lolita is. a glance at the menu will have anyone exclaiming \\say what?!\\\" but it's the little asterik @ the bottom declaring that 4 dishes can be made with a substitution of pan seared three chile tofu or grilled portobella. i opted for the tofu (duh) prepared a la duck - so it was served atop sweet & warm plantains in a sour cherry salsita (chock full of dried cherries) with a garnish of jicama orange slaw. \\\"yum\\\" would be an understatement.   the thing is  it's not just about how tasty my particular entree was  it is the fact that i actually have more than 1 veg meal option combined with the fact that it's not just taking out the meat from a dish and charging me the same price or offering some mediocre pasta/risotto/beans+rice option. dining at lolita  i can actually order a protein-laden dish straight off the menu  with the same sauces and sides as my meat-eating companions!! you have no idea how appreciative i am of this....or if you are a veg  perhaps you do?  thank you  lolita. MWAH!\"\n",
      "This place was great! And EVERYTHING on the menu is gluten free!   The boyfriend and I were walking around the city after a Phillies game looking for some late night food and drinks and happened to come across Lolita.  We were seated outside on the sidewalk  it was a little weird to be sitting about a foot away from someones car parked on the street but it didn't affect the experience.    We ordered the Tradicional guacamole and salsa and the Carnitas y Panzo tacos  both of which were amazing! Rounded out the meal with 2 great margaritas  house and blood orange.   We will definitely be returning!\n",
      "THE most amazing food! The service was great  the atmosphere was a romantics dream.  I sort of liked the BYOT  makes the whole event a little more personal. Cant wait to return... Ohh and the Mahi Mahi is Unbelievable!!\n",
      "I've been coming here for years since I was a little girl. I love this place. I have tried several other Vietnamese restaurant but this place is the best. We usually get the clay pot cat fish  spring rolls  grilled beef wrapped in grape leaves  sweet and sour seafood soup  pork chop over broken rice  salt baked chicken and grilled shrimp. I wish they didn't keep raising the prices though.\n",
      "\n",
      "You must order the spring rolls.  They are unparalleled. It has gotten a little pricier over the years  but it has an upscale modern atmosphere.  Also the corn rice pudding is worth a try.\n",
      "their BBQ Platter is a MUST TRY. they keep increasing the price but its definitely worth getting especially as a shared appetizer dish. their pho is small in portion but tasty. Also  their pork chop and broken rice dish is surprisingly good--not oily and fatty but juicy and clean.\n",
      "While the menu isn't overly creative  and there are certainly cheaper options of similar food in the immediate area  this place has a nice intimate atmosphere over which to enjoy a meal and conversation.\n",
      "Best spot in town for quality of food  location  consistency and overall service.  Pho is top notch along with the egg rolls.  I miss this place so much after moving away  that I make it a point to stop by here on long layovers now.  You could argue there's better spots in the \\Philly Area\\\" but this is by far the best spot down town  and it's rare to get both good service and good food in the Vietnamese game.\"\n",

      "This is a favorite restaurant of my husband's as well as some close friends of ours who are on a first name basis with Benny (the owner).  We always enjoy going and ordering all sorts of different things that we can pass around and share.  I love all the variety  and try to have something new every time.    Enjoy the Vietnamese beer (Okay so that I've tried the same of more than once!)  we always share the BBQ Platter and our eyes are always bigger than our stomachs as we share a Pho soup and both still order a main course each!  Makes for good leftovers!  : )  Be prepared to be there for awhile  but that is part of what I really enjoy about it.  It's quality time with friends rather than a rushed meal.  Everything always tastes extremely fresh  and I'd recommend trying it out if you've never been before.\n",
      "I live a block away from Villa Di Roma.  I've been there probably a dozen times.  I don't understand the hype. The food is solid. The food is good.       Maybe I think it's on the expensive side for Italian food.  $15 for Veal Parm?  $11 for spaghetti with olive oil?       I'm totally unimpressed by the garlic bread and I thought the breaded asparagus was far too soaked in butter.       The thing is - I'm totally not a food snob at all.   Maybe I need to be a food snob to appreciate this place?       Someone local help me out and explain what I'm missing compared to the 15 other Italian places within two blocks?\n",
      "Amazing food and service! My family had the meatballs  chicken parm  manicotti  and baked ziti which wasn't baked but tossed and served on plate. Delish none the less! Will definitely visit them again. And again!\n",
      "Didn't have high expectations for this place  so that's probably why I was so pleasantly surprised. The place definitely had a very authentic Italian feel to it. There was a large group of Italian ladies dining nearby--gave the restaurant a boisterous  Italian feel. So A+ for awesome vibes.   The food was excellent--my sister and I ordered the Meatball and Eggplant parmigiana sandwiches for lunch. They were standard hoagie-style sandwiches  but the eggplant  I gotta say  was amazing.   The service was alright--the waitress seemed a little rushed  but really no complaints.   I loved this place and will definitely be going again. Prices were very affordable as well.\n",
      "Food is fair at best The service is just awful awful and awful better to go to Olive Garden\n",
      "I am in heaven when I go to the Villa Di Roma! I eat at the bar and I feel like family. Mary is such a wonderful person. No frills  outstanding food  and a family atmosphere. God bless these folks. A South Philly treasurer!\n",
      "The wife loves this S. Philly dive  but it's typical S. Philly  Italian fare. Expect to wait. The mussles are good and ask for plenty of bread. You can't let that broth go to waste.  Plan to be scolded by a S. Philly mother if you don't finish your plate and don't want the rest wrapped.  )\n",
      "2nd stop on our grand tour of Philly Italian establishments: Villa Di Roma.  Cash only and no reservations. Knowing this  dining partner and I arrived around 6:45 on a Friday to try and beat the dinner date crowd. We were seated after a short wait in the bar area. Appetizers: we split the Villa Salad which was good (but only if you like your salad drenched in Russian or Thousand Island-type dressing) and I ate all of the fried asparagus. I ordered the gnocchi as my entree and dining partner ordered the Chicken Marsala. The gnocchi was served with a garlicy red-ish sauce with plenty of leftovers to take home and the Chicken Marsala sauce was excellent. Our waitress Jeanie was outgoing  very helpful with recommending dishes  and was attentive in filling our drinks and bread basket. We managed to save room for dessert  unfortunately the cannolis were gone so we settled on cheesecake  which was a great way to end the dinner.\n",
      "If NYC was just a bitttt closer  I would drive to Villa Di Roma just for dinner. Coming from a girl who was born and raised in The Bronx and knows real Italian food cooked by Italian Mothers and grandmothers...this place is so legit.  The feeling of the restaurant itself is super authentic. No frills. Even the wait staff is authentic.   Now the best part is the food  of course. The pasta is so fresh and the sauce is to die for. We had the ravioli and meatballs as well as the seafood white sauce spaghetti. I wish I was with more people so that I could have tried more variety of menu options. Guess that just gives me a reason to come back!\n",
      "Came here for a celebration dinner with my little sister.  She had the lasagna and I had the quattrocini Alfredo and we split an appetizer of mussels in white sauce. The base for the mussels were very good and there were definitely enough mussels for two people to share. Then our main courses came out promptly we both agreed our food was very good. I would have gave this place four stars but our service was terrible. Our waitress never came to check on us ... I had to go to other waitresses for things such as more water or another drink and our check  it was ridiculous. It made me not even wanting to tip! The crazy thing was the place wasn't even that busy! I will not be going back.\n",
      "I would probably lean more towards giving this place a three  but the husband loved it. It's a pretty unassuming place  probably would never have stopped in if I hadn't read such great reviews. The interior looks like it hasn't been updated since well...ever. You sit on some rickety chairs at small tables with dingy white tablecloths thrown abstractly over the table. Let's just say you don't come here for the aesthetics. We ordered the chicken marsala  veal eggplant parm and a couple meatballs to share. As a non-Italian I am probably not the best the review the \\gravy\\\" but my husband said it transported him right back into his grandmother's kitchen. The meatballs were moist and yummy  but we could have used some better bread to soak up all that deliciousness. Same goes with my marsala  it wasn't served with pasta  so once you ate up all the delicious chicken there was a plate full of sauce that I literally wanted to eat with a spoon. Really Really Good... The veal eggplant parm was equally as delicious  the plate was literally licked clean.   Bottom Line: Go for some authentic Italian American cuisine while enjoying the Italian market  just don't forget cash only---the dishes were a little pricier than I expected so bring an ample amount just in case.\"\n",
      "LOVE this place! fabulous service  delicious food  and sinful dessert choices. Perfect for any occasion.\n",
      "This is a neighborhood go-to for drinks! The atmosphere is lively and polished. The staff  special shout out to Joe  are very friendly and attentive. And when the weather is nice and tables line the exterior  it is the perfect spot to have a late afternoon glass of wine with friends!\n",
      "This review is based off of my last visit which occurred during restaurant week. The service was good but the food itself was just  meh. I started with the calamari salad which was over fried and not that tasty. For my main course I got the butternut squash raviolis which were just three large raviolis on a plate  nothing else (sans sauce). They were plain and really lacking taste and flavor. My fiancee got the fish tacos which he enjoyed but was not blown away.\n",
      "I live around the corner from this place and have stopped in for food in the past -- at times  I have thought that their food was a \\bit\\\" overpriced  but today really took the cake...  After a long day of meetings and classes  I was starving and ordered a Turkey Burger (from the \\\"Daily Show\\\" portion of the menu). Originally $15  but I asked to substitute the fries for brussels sprouts (more on this later).   Since I live nearby  was starving  and had a bunch of finals to study for  I was thrilled that my order was ready in 20 minutes. I picked up my food and walked home  excited for a healthy(ish) burger with all the toppings  and instead...I got a turkey patty + cheese on a bun. Where was the lettuce  tomato  onion  pickle? All of the other burgers on the menu came with these items (even the Veggied Burger  which only costs $11)! Ok  maybe it was in the other box...nope  just the brussels sprouts. Imagine my complete and utter disappointment when I bit into the burger and it was also DRY.  When I called back to ask about it  the guy said that he had mistakenly told me that it came with the toppings  even though it shouldn't have. He offered to fix it  but at that point  with a final project and half a dozen papers looming over my head  did I really have the time to make *yet another* round-trip to the restaurant?  Oh  and to add insult to injury? I got charged $2 for replacing the fries with brussels sprouts...can someone tell me how this makes any sense at all  when the two items differ by only $1 on the menu when ordered as sides?  I normally give restaurants the benefit of the doubt  but I feel like it's a complete ripoff to charge someone $17 for essentially a turkey patty on bread.  This was  sadly  one of the most disappointing dining experience I've had anywhere :(\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was really slow  it was on a Tuesday night! Food was cold and didn't have much flavor. The tables that came after my party were served before us. Felt very neglected and ignored by our waiter. Will not be returning or recommending this restaurant to anyone. The only reason why I didn't give a one star was because the wines and cocktails were good.\n",
      "I returned to Twenty Manning for the second time with high hopes. We scored a last minute reservation for 5 at 7:30 on a Saturday. When we entered the place was PACKED! The bar area full of twenty-somethings and most of the tables occupied. We were seated upon our arrival and we started off with two apps: the charcuterie board and oysters on the half shell. Both were really good. I opted for the chop chop salad and crispy phylo shrimp as my entree. I thoroughly enjoyed the phylo shrimp. The chop chop salad was fine  but was overshadowed by the shrimp. Two of my dining companions had the charbroiled beef sirloin noodle bowl and another had the tuna burger. Three of us enjoyed the half baked Tollhouse cookie with ice cream for dessert. I had lusted after this dessert after seeing it online. It was good  but more mine was more cake-y than cookie. Service was attentive and the ambiance was dark and romantic. In my opinion Twenty Manning is much better than it's sister restaurant  Audrey Claire  across the street in both menu and ambiance.  An aside: My first visit to Twenty Manning was for Restaurant Week Jan 2014. I was satisfied with my Bison Burger and huge pile of shoestring fires. Later when I did the math and figured out the three course meal I had would have been less than the $35 Restaurant Week price. That revelation made me suffer from meal-regret. Stay away from Twenty Manning during restaurant week.\n",
      "Why are you eating here.  Seriously  why.  Did \\friends\\\" invite you out?  Then you need better friends.  Were you threatened by the previous Asian-influenced menu and decided to overcompensate by loving Food For White People?  Is the decor of Pub and Kitchen perhaps too much to take and you needed a place that is the interior decorating version of a warm bath?  In short: do you love the Barefoot Contessa?  Look  people: the burger was decidedly mediocre  the beer selection kind of appalling especially with Food and Friends right next door  and our friends got frozen vegetables.  That's not great dining  especially when there are so many options present nearby.  You can do better  Philadelphia.  I have faith in you.\"\n",
      "Perhaps it's because we felt a bit like those Emma Lazarus describes in her famous sonnet  but this place was an oasis from the cold and a welcome find. The chef and management clearly pay attention since there was a broad assortment of hot drinks and soup available on a sub-freezing night. Service was prompt and attentive  the hot drinks were served quickly and the rest of the meal was tasty. I opted for the smoked  double cut pork chop and ranks in the top 3 I've ever had. Southerners take note  these Yankees know how to cook a chop properly. :)  Once again  trust your fellow Yelpers  this place worked hard to earn my money.\n",
      "Very fun place  great drinks - dinner menu was a little \\earthy\\\" for my liking but the appetizers were out of this world.  The atmosphere was fantastic  would definitely have a drink at the bar and maybe a snack then go out for the night somewhere else  loved the decor.\"\n",
      "After trying twice unsuccessfully to get there early enough to get a meal within 20 minutes  I finally was able to break away from work and was 5th in line. I had heard of the \\food truck nazi\\\" and that it was the best in town and found Gus  the falafel nazi  as he called himself  lived up to his reputation and more.  As my turn came up  I approached the cart tenuously  for I did not want to blow it by asking too many questions. He immediately recognized me as a new customer and told me all about the fresh ingredients he uses. Chicken is cooked over coal and was tender on the inside and perfectly cooked on the outside. Falafel was delicious  as were the grapes and his homemade pasta that went along with it. There was enough food for 2 people. Well worth the wait!\"\n",
      "I am a groupie. He is amazing. I am sad that I got to have his dish only once. Now all construction on market I can't find him!!  His chicken is the most tender and smoky I've ever had. Side dishes are creative and awesome too.  I hope he is back soon.\n",
      "Chicken was awesome! Loved the char and the garlic marinade. I can't say the same for the rest of the meal! Rice was cold but flavorful and probably would have tasted better if it was warm and dryer. The hummus was average and the falafel was just awful. I'm Arab so I know my fair share of felafel. This was not even acceptable in my standards for America! Everything was fresh though which is why I gave it a 3 + epic chicken. Not worth the wait and the possible risk of being yelled at. Too much hype for just the experience.  PS: if you want real falafel and epic hummus  walk down the street to Mama's.\n",
      "The hype is worth the wait. I had never tried falafels prior to my visit to the the Falafel Nazi/ Falafel King (I know this is not PC  and no offense is intended)  but it is an appropriate title to give him. It doesn't just communicate how great the food is  but the experience you'll have.   The standard Center City lunch crowd knows this unmarked cart on 20th  and it usually has a long line in front of it. Prepare for passerby's to make comments on how you're waiting in line  inquiring as to what it is for  and pretty much just staring at you. *Tip* show up just before 12:00pm to limit the waiting. We got there at 11:45 and still had to wait 40 minutes.   There is no menu. Get used not to making choices. The cart is run by one man  and he is eccentric  but entertaining. He clearly has a passion for his food. You'll receive what he serves  but expect hummus  falafel  and chicken. He changes it up based on his shopping that week  and I had had a mix of watercress  apples  melons with mine. The sauce was spicy and divine.   It's worth the wait.  *Remember: Cash only!\n",
      "went here for the first time today - drawn by the amazing smell of the charcoal grill.  looked around for a menu - couldnt find one..then a regular in the line said - \\theres only one thing on the menu any given day\\\"...line was slow...had to wait almost 15 minutes with just 5 people in front..  The food was incredible...the hummus was fantastic...the falafel fantastic...the greens were easily separated (and tossed..)..the chicken was tender and amazingly tasty...and the rice-lentil mix (no idea what it really is) was terrific...there was also a giant piece of bread...whole bunch of food for $10...  definitely worth the wait...definitely worth going back again\"\n",
      "Be patient  the owner chef cook whatever you want to call him  he's unqiue  talks a lot and can be difficult to understand but you can see he simply loves to cook. He doesn't skimp nor cheat you. He asks whatever you can pay for and gives you more. The food is great but its his love of customers & food that drives this business.\n",
      "Gus is the best!  His commitment to quality ingredients and preparation details are inspiring.  Unfortunately  I got my platter today and had NO FALAFEL....from a falafel truck!  So  after browsing Yelp  I learned that his fryer broke and the cost is too high to fix.  I started a gofundme to see if we can raise the 3k to bring back falafel!!!  It's under falafel fryer for Gus.  https://www.gofundme.com/falafel-fryer-for-gus\n",
      "My office building is right off of 20th and Market so this is the perfect lunch spot for me.  Like others before me have stated  the wait can be long  but I usually get around that by opting for a later lunch on days that I choose to eat from the Falafel truck. 1:00 is usually perfect.   Some people are offended by Konstadinos' rules  but really  I appreciate them. The fact that there isn't a menu is exciting! I like not knowing exactly what I'm going to get... but maybe I'm more adventurous than some people. Really  though  it's not even like he switches things up that much... He just tweaks the details a bit. The chicken is always on the platter  there is always falafel  and there is always hummus. The dessert salad and the chickpea salad/rice/whatever is all that really changes.  And I also appreciate that he doesn't let you hold a spot for someone or order more than one platter. He realizes that most of his clientele are working folks that are on tight schedules.   If you're lucky  you might catch him on a good day and he'll throw in a free drink. It's only happened to me once or twice  but still  a nice little perk. And if it happens to be cold out/rainy out  he sometimes offers soup while you wait!   As far as comparing him to Mama's  I do enjoy Mama's  but the Falafel truck takes the cake in my opinion.  It's $10 well spent  especially since I usually get two meals out of it. Just be prepared for some serious lingering garlic breath!\n",
      "Wow  just wow!  The food was unbelievable.  No photo since I scarfed it down before I thought to snap a picture.  We got there just before noon and there were 3-4 people in line.  All-in-all we were there a good 15 min.  Not bad.  Everything everyone said is absolutely true.  So fresh  so yummy.  I was a little surprised that the rice/chick pea dish was cold (everything except the chicken and fallafel were)  but it was delish none-the-less.  For $10  my platter included the most amazing smelling (and tasting) grilled chicken  a rice and chick pea mixture  hummus  a small scoop of the best fruit salad I've ever eaten  some sort of greens  and a nice hunk of crusty bread (I got the nose).  I'll definitely go back again!\n",
      "PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST MIDDLE EASTERN   MEDITERRANEAN FOODS! HE JUST PILES IT ON AND IT'S JUST AMAZING! THE MAN KNOWS HOW TO WORK A CART!  TIP: + You do not get to choose what you get. Only one item on the menu and it's always a little different from the last time. + Long wait so get there early or later during lunch time. + Used to be $5 now it's $10 i believe. + One order per person. + Cash only + He's a warm friendly guy so have a conversation with him while he prepares your order. + You will smell like the food you ate for the next day or two but it's worth it! + You will have food coma if you attempt to eat it all in one sitting. + He's got piles of garlic and flowers on his cart which is cool. + You can smell his food cart from a block away.\n",
      "wait was long but it was new years day. the pho GA was good  the beef could have been better... a primary dish that should speak for the restaurant  did not perform. Service was horrible... asked for ice coffee 3 times from three different employees and still never got our ice coffee. we somehow managed to get two cokes for the price of one. !   ADVICE: Know what you want before you order cause you will not get a second chance to order anything else!   Pgo GA broth was delish though....\n",
      "Best pho around. Pho 75 wishes their broth had this much depth. If you have an ironic mustache and like to pretend you knew everything first  eat at 75. If you're a normal  functioning member of society that has the ability to make up your own mind  head to Saigon. All steak phos and the bun bo hue are awesome. This is one of the best yelp reviews ever.\n",
      "The place usually fills up by noon time with a long wait. So get there early if you don't want to wait. Service is spotty  somehow they seem to forget you after they gave you the menu and tea. Twice now we have to get their attention before someone stop by to take our orders.   But if you let the service put you off  then you miss out on some good pho. The chicken pho is very good. I always have the dark meat with skin on which is much more flavorful than the white meat. The ben bo hue is excellent  not too spicy but enough to make you sweat a little. Big chunk of pigs feet! The mix beef pho was also very good with lots of meat and flavorful broth.   After a bowl of that yummy pho  you can go shopping at the mall or better yet go home and take a nap.   Lots of parking  so that is a plus.\n",
      "This is one of the spots in philly I enjoy on a regular basis because the food is great  big menu  and the service is fast as lightning. Yeah its a little bit out of the way but if I were to go anywhere else in the city Id have to take an uber lyft or pay for parking  but seeing as how it is  not in center city FREE PARKING. The pho is great. I really cant knock it. I had their flan and I didnt know it was a coffee flavored flan so that knocked socks off me in a good way. Overall this is a great spot for pho if youre willing to drive to it.\n",
      "Fabulous.    I'm a long-time adherent to Pho Hoa  but the soup here is just a little bit better: the beef broth is a tad more toothsome  the bean sprouts are slightly snappier  and the noodles are just more slurpable.  If only it wasn't tucked in a strip mall on Columbus and within walking distance of my house!\n",
      "Pho Saigon is the closest Pho Joint to my house and I have adopted it with open arms.  They do a really nice job  the restaurant itself is clean and contemporary  the service is efficient and to the point (as with most pho joints... These folks don't mess around....) And I always go with number 70  and the broth is tasty and makes me sufficiently sleepy when I get home.  My boyfriend likes it spicy and goes with #44 and always leaves a sweaty mess.  They have more parking that all the chaos on Washington Ave or in China town.  Spring rolls are great too! The TV's always have the games on too.  Can't go wrong with Pho Saigon!\n",
      "Overall  Pho Saigon is a an affordable Vietnemese restaurant with all the traditional things you will love. It does not really step outside of the realms of the run of the mill vietnemese restaurants  however  you will get quick service with high quality food at an affordable price.   The FAPS Breakdown:  Food Quality - The food was pretty spectacular for the price. I ordered the Com Tam Thit Nuong Dac Biet (Broken Rice Combo: Charbroiled Pork  Shredded Pork  Egg Quiche & Omele) and my buddy got the same thing but the pork chop. Both were excellent. The pork was well seasoned and grilled and had a lot of flavor. The egg quiche had some vermicelli noodles in the inside which gave it a weird look  but it was pretty bomb. The \\omelet\\\" is just a fried egg over the rice  great side but dont expect a mom and pops ole fashioned omelet at this vietnemese restaurant.... you should probably go to a diner for that.   Ambiance - Big open space great for casual lunch/dinner with a small or big group. The restaurant is a little out of the way from the main hussle and bussle of philadelphia. Its located at a strip mall by the water front so you will have easy parking. There are usually a decent amount of people here although I wouldnt expect a line.   Price - $-$$ seemed appropriate for this restaurant. Had some solid entrees at a good price and we were pleasantly surprised by the great price for the food.   Service - Classic Vietnamese restaurant  they wont spend any time for idle chit chat  youre here to eat and they are there to help you accomplish that goal. Food arrived quickly after ordering and the waiters were very attentive.\"\n",
      "Fresh  Delicious Phos good Better than pho 75  If it matters. I'm part Viet and have traveled to Vietnam just to taste their pho so I can return to tell you how close pho Saigon comes to Vietnam's pho but falls just short. This restaurant deserves no less than four stars. F the service. F the location. F whatever. I'm here for food damn it and its good here.   This is the word on the street.   By Viet Boy\n",
      "One of my favorite Pho spots to go to.  The place is clean  parking is convenient  and the food is pretty good too.  I especially love their beef stew pho.  The stewed beef just melts in your mouth  it is so tender and yummy.\n",
      "This was our go to Pho place for two years until we moved.  Service is quick  food is great and it's priced right.  The summer roles are awesome too.  I could drink the peanut sauce alone.\n",
      "I thought long and hard about giving this either four or five stars for the meal we had last night. It's official - it's a five. Immediately we were greeted by super friendly hosts  seated in great chef's counter spots  and introduced to a knowledgable and kind waiter. We were able to watch the food get expedited  and the process ran so smoothly. Honestly  this is what Philly dining is all about to me. Great food  done really well on a consistent basis  and I'm so lucky to be surrounded by so many restaurants of such high quality.  The menu seemed to have a very Japanese/Korean flair to it. The highlights of our evening were the brussel sprout tartine  the corn ravioli  and the duck breast entree. The duck was cooked perfectly  but it was paired with cold and slightly hard potatoes...not sure if that was on purpose?  We also tried one of the Ramen dishes  the one with pork belly in it  and although it was extremely savory and smoky  it was also very filling and left us way too stuffed to try anything else. We ended up taking some food home with us. I would love to come back here because I got to see almost every dish while sitting at the counter  and it all looked flawless and exciting. Serpico just has a really great dining experience - the end.\n",
      "Tonight my wife and I had the tasting menu at Serpico. It had ten off-menu courses for $85 a person.  This meal was completely worth every penny. The dishes were intricate and unique  but completely approachable. I found myself surprised more than once by how much I enjoyed an ingredient that I had previously thought of as intimidating.  We sat at the chef counter  a choice that made the evening. Watching the staff work together in such a cooperative and composed manner was such a unique experience. It made the complex nature of the dishes even more impressive.  This was truly one of the best dinners that I have ever had. I would recommend this meal to anyone.\n",
      "We had a reservation for Opening Night at Serpico and we were very impressed with the space  the food  and the service.  We were able to score 2 seats at the Chef's Counter which is always a plus.  I really like that the kitchen is visible because it just gives you something else to talk about and watch.  You can definitely tell that there are Momofuku inspirations here and that is to be expected.  We started off with drinks  I got the South Street Sour which was wonderfully made and I ended up having more than 1.  We ended up ordering a total of 8 dishes including dessert and we were really full by the end of the meal.  We just wanted to make sure that we tried as much as possible.  2 plates at a time were served to us and we were given enough time between the courses to just talk with each other and enjoy ourselves.  We started off with the Market Ceviche and the Fluke Crudo which were both very good  but the crudo was definitely stellar with the jalapeno infused olive oil.  Next we got the Deep Fried Duck Leg Sandwich and the Hand Torn Pasta.  This is tough because both were unbelievably tasty but the duck leg sandwich was just out of this world.  Next we got the Waygu flap that was deep fried and the Caper Brined Trout.  Again both of these were very very tasty but if I had to pick a winner it was the trout.  The trout was cooked absolutely perfectly and came with a potato risotto which was a perfect pairing for the dish.  We ended the meal with the Toasted Apple Cake and the Rocky Road dessert.  Both were spectacular and had some really cool texture plays (freeze dried apples) and I liked them equally so it's hard to pick a winner.  For being rated $$$$ on Open Table and on Yelp  we didn't think that the prices were all that bad for what you got.  You will need to order 2-3 dishes though so just be prepared for that.  We will definitely be back soon once Serpico gets a little bit more mature and I can't wait for them to start offering specials and also this fall when they switch up the menu a bit.    This is a must-go now in Philly.\n",
      "An update has been overdue for a while  considering how often I stop by. I admit  I have spent far more money than I likely should have  but every time I stop by I never  ever  seem to regret the decision. It's really been something how they have slowly changed over the past nine or so months. They are constantly tweaking and experimenting  and there is often a special or two that is so good that it gets worked on the the menu.  I will repeat something I said in my last review: Peter Serpico is a shining example of a Modernist Chef. There are no dishes that will poke your eye out  no insane liquid nitrogen going off. The application of technology and complexity is subtler. The components on the plate aren't there to look pretty (though the presentations are beautiful)  they are there because they should all be eaten at the same time because all of those flavors have been carefully selected to go together.  In approximately 8-10 visits I have yet to have a bad dish  though some are certainly better than others. The raw fluke  cobia and yellowfin tartare  duck liver mousse  dashi soup  fried duck leg and (the recently removed) hand torn pasta are all repeat favorites  and I tend to get one as a standby while I try something new. Portions are small  and you need to be willing to lay down some cash when you get here  but I enjoy being able to try many things and not walk away feeling bloated.  I love the atmosphere. It's proof that you can be high quality without being pretentious and stuffy  and the decorations are free of buillshit. The place looks clean and ordered without ornate wall art  or glittering china. Plates are simple but umblemished ceramic. Menus are written on the board in chalk  as are notes for the kitchen. The tables and chef's counter are dark wood  and while immaculately clean with sharp edges  it feels like a place where you can loosen a tie and put your elbows up on a counter and get about the serious task of enjoying  really enjoying food.  The staff recognizes regulars (at least I am when showing up every 6-8 weeks) and they are rewarded with insightful advice on specials  underappreciated menu items and . The bartenders respond well to the challenge of \\Make me something different\\\" and they have a small  but tasty  selection of excellent signature cocktails that run you about the cost a standard cocktail in center city.   I'm happy with what I have seen  and I look forward to seeing more.\"\n",
      "Well I've been to the promised land...and it was good.  Attention from staff  which is a Starr detail...was excellent as it is in all his places...decor was interesting...urban hip I suppose.  We sat at the counter that surrounds the kitchen on a lark.  My diver scallops were excellent...never had raw scallops before and was a bit leery...but they were worth it...tasty little bites with an excellent light white sauce.  My wife's tomato and beans salad was nice and crispy with just a bit of a bite to it.  Next for me was the wagyu chuck cooked perfectly...the mustard sauce was a surprisingly good touch and the fried potatoes  while verging on tater totism were good nonetheless...my wife's  corn ravioli and sauce were excellent also...dessert for me was the toasted applecake covered with carmalized brown suger and a dollop of ice cream...wife had the goat cheese sorbet...the score...appertizer and dessert me...entree was tied...holding back on the 5th star till the next time we go...bravo chef serpico  bravo!\n",
      "This was a really delightful meal all around.  Out of the the 18 dishes on the menu  we tried 14 between the 3 of us (a bit ridiculous it may sound but we were celebrating!).  Of those 14  4 of them I am still dreaming out  even more of those  I would order again and only 1 that was mediocre at best.  Dream-worthy: Raw divers scallops - it was almost a take on ranch dressing and hamachi but fancier Pig head - served with this burnt onion tapenade which I could literally put on anything Liver mousse - great texture and just the right portion egg custard and cavier - probably my favorite dish  rich but light and the cavier and crisp potatoes added a dynamic texture  Repeat offenders: Duck leg - loved the authenticity of serving it on a potato roll  takes some balls to do this corn ravioli - this felt like Mexican street food and i loved how rustic it was seasonal vegetables - could have eaten piles of it and just thought it was well dressed and fresh  The plating was beautiful and the service was great.  I loved how the sous chefs and line cooks were tasked with dropping plates at the table.  Seeing them float throughout the dining room during a busy service spoke to their style and how they operate in the kitchen.    The duck breast was our last entree  served alongside the wagyu chuck flap.  The duck was just okay.  The carrots were mush and it was the only plate that went back with food on it.  The chuck was tasty but didn't blow me away.  Overall  I would go back and perhaps try the tasting menu and some of the other courses.  Oh and the dessert was BANGIN.  Loved the apple cake  talk about an ethereal twist on an American classic.  The fois gras was inventive and texture-wise  really different but ultimately it tasted like a PB&J sandwich.  Was that Serpico's intention?  Just might have been...\n",
      "This probably makes my top 10 meals in Philly list.  My husband and I shared 5 plates  which was the perfect amount of food  and everything was delicious.  The waitstaff were helpful with choosing our dishes  and I liked that they explained what was in each one again as they came out to the table.\n",
      "Had a truly spectacular meal at Serpico last night. First we were seated at the kitchen counter right in front of the spot where they finish every dish and put them out for servers. We could not have had a better vantage point and it was fun to watch Peter Serpico right in front of us cooking and running the kitchen the whole time we were there.   We decided to splurge and get the tasting menu. It was awesome. Ten courses nicely spaced over about 2 1/2 - 2 3/4 hours. The food was all great  but I would have to say that the stand outs for me were:  - The raw scallops - I don't think I have ever tasted anything quite like this. It was truly awesome.  - The lamb ribs were great.  - The trout was really good  but perhaps the best part about it was that it was such an unusual dish. Trout on a bed of shaved apples in a smoked potato broth (that was perfectly clear) topped with fresh shaved horseradish.  - The rocky road dessert was amazing.   Just because I had read so much about the Cope's Corn Ravioli on yelp  we actually added that on as well. Given the volume of food that may have been a mistake  but the dish was great and was quite an explosion of flavor.   I am definitely looking forward to going back.\n",
      "If each of my dishes got into a taste fight (Is that a real thing?  If not it should be.)  the winner of the evening would have been the deep fried duck leg. AHHHHMAZING!  Just a hunch  but I think it was Peter Serpico's shout out/tribute to the Momofuku pork bun.  If it was  it was on par with it.  However  in this taste fight  the duck leg would have definitely gone into overtime with the applecake.  My sweet tooth was such a happy girl after finishing my meal with this decadent plate of tastiness.  Everything else we ordered - dashi soup  seasonal vegetables  hand torn pasta and raw fluke all washed down with a Uinta IPA - was also very good  but the above two dishes rose to the top.  If I had to offer one small piece of advice/constructive criticism  it would be that they didn't really acknowledge our anniversary.  We were celebrating 7 years and for the occasion we ordered 7 menu items (super cute  right?).  I mentioned this to the waitress and I think also put it in my OpenTable reso.  While I didn't expect a ridiculous TGIFriday jingle  some sort of note on our receipt or well wish from Peter Serpico when he delivered our entrees would have been over the top amazing for us.  Maybe I'm expecting too much?  But as someone who has a mag subscription to Lucky Peach  eats something from the Momofuku family of restaurants nearly every time I'm in New York and read about the planning  opening and first few months of this restaurant eagerly awaiting a special enough occasion to taste the food of Dave Chang's former right-hand man  I was a little sad.     But other than that  the service was great and everyone was very friendly and helpful.\n",
      "We absolutely loved our experience here and would definitely recommend dining here! The server was well versed in the menu and was able to discuss what dishes went well together and were not to be missed. He was very attentive throughout the entire meal.   Tataki: This is normally waygu but that day they were serving a different cut of aged beef. Still amazing. The meat was very fresh and was wonderfully complimented with pickled and spicy horseradish notes.  Raw Scallops: My favorite dish! The raw scallops were so delightfully sweet and tender uniquely complimented by chive oil and buttermilk which reminded me of scallion cream cheese but didn't overpower the scallop.   Egg with Caviar: My favorite mushroom! (cauliflower mushroom) in a rich broth with the lightest egg custard covered in crunchy bits and caviar. Very unique dish that I would definitely recommend.  Mac & Cheese: My partners favorite dish! Homemade hand torn noodles which were the perfect texture covered by one of the creamiest and rich cheese sauces with a touch of paprika to add some mild spice.  Black truffle ramen: Another wonderfully textured noodle with a rich broth and smothered in black truffles.\n",
      "So glad I found this place. Their chicken quesadilla is my favorite thing on the menu. It's always fresh. It's perfect for lunch because it doesn't leave you feeling overly full. It has a strong sports bar type of feel whenever a home team is playing  so if you're not into that  just skip it on nights when there's games playing.\n",
      "This place is funky and fun! Awesome Northeast Philly gem :) Love the food. Very accommodating for large parties! They also offer Sunday brunch that I would highly recommend  they have a lot of those things on the menu you would see on Food Network and wonder...where can I get fried chicken wrapped in pancakes? Three Monkeys Cafe!\n",
      "I absolutely love the themed decor  the drinks  coconut margarita to be exact and the customer service. Honestly  I've had better food. Perhaps it was just the dish I tried but I'm willing to return and explore different options. Overall enjoyable experience.\n",
      "I went to Three Monkeys with my family for a quick dinner. I was not disappointed. We all went simple with burgers. I got the Sunny in Philly and was very happy with it. Drinks could have been a bit stronger  but were still good. Only thing I didn't care for was the noise. We were seated in the dining area  but it still seemed that we had to yell to be heard over the crowd.\n",
      "What can I say.... if you have not been here I am sorry for you. Wonderful burgers and outside seating. The staff is very friendly and will help with menu choices. There is an up charge for salad instead of their homemade chips  with burgers but that is fine. They make a steak sandwich with crab that is awesome. If not on the menu just ask for it. My husband hates eating out but always says yes to coming here.\n",

      "Their fries are excellent as they do not peel them and they are perfectly seasoned. I also ordered their calamari  which was too sweet for my taste. They have an excellent selection of beer such as the watermelon one and the father's rooter  but I found their cocktails to be too sweet for me. It was still an excellent experience all around as the ambience at Three Monkey's Cafe is very nice  the staff is friendly and professional and I also love the fact that they are such interesting art all over the place  including Salvador Dali prints.\n",
      "One of the best bars restaurants in the NE. The outside in the summer is very chill and a wonderful place to have brunch. Phenomenal menu\n",
      "The two stars are for the environment food  lacked some serious seasoning  our waitress Claudia (which I had to ask someone because she didn't introduce herself) was miserable  either I got my beer with a glass or just an orange shoved in it or just a bottle of beer  the bartender was super sweet though!!!!\n",
      "Good outdoor place  but extremely crowded on weekend nights. Good food and service....just the hostesses could be more courteous.\n",

      "I'm not impressed. Although New Deck oozes pub warmth on a cold winter day  I'd pop in for a drink  not lunch.   While my food was OK - I had the french onion soup and split the portabello sandwich - I've had the same dishes much tastier in other locations. Including my own kitchen. The soup was warm but underwhelming  the portabello seemed to have been left out of the marinating process and only dresses with a dash of balsamic  the fries had been obviously friend in old oil.   Add to the blah food the fact that my dining companion and I both found hairs in our food (to be fair  I have a lot of hair  and the particularly long one could have been mine) and there were little unappetizing gnats buzzing around the table.   Our waitress also rushed the crap out of us. She tried to take our drink order before we even had our jackets off  and tried to make me order while my partner was still in the restroom blowing his wind-battered nose. Bad waitress! She did  however  bring two dill pickles  as requested.   The only thing saving the New Deck from a one-star review is beer  and the fact that I know they have a pretty rowdly  rambunctious  and often grad-school-difficult quizzo night  which is pretty fun if you get there early enough to grab an upstairs table.   In summary  just because you're a college bar doesn't been you can coast by with insulting service and ho-hum food. Step it up!\n",
      "When Mad Mex is packed  New Deck is a reliable default.  A table will always be open for you and your crew.  You have your choice of long tables in a quieter downstairs  or small- and medium-sized tables in the busier upstairs.  Hit up the bar if you want to make new friends.  Pros are the variety of creative vodka drinks  scrumptiously fatty fries and location on Samsom Street.  Cons are the slow service  greasy menus  greasy food (i know  I just praised the fries  but the healthy options are lacking).\n",
      "First off  the Awesome Fries are awesome and deserve 4.5 stars. However  the rest of the meal was average  so I could not see myself rating a place solely on one appetizer.   But  if you like fries  the Awesome Fries is a huge platter that can easily serve a group of 4-5 who want to munch on this goodness. The fries are amazingly crispy  loaded with cheese and bacon bits.  It's your typical bar atmosphere  slightly on the noisy side and dimly lit. Our server was very nice  and extremely patient with us.  I ordered the Buffalo Chicken sandwich. It was decent. Nothing spectacular though. My wife got the Swiss Chicken  also decent but nothing spectacular.  I think back in my collage days I would have loved hitting this place up in the late night for some beer and appetizers.  For dinner  it's okay and does the trick  if you want something fast and moderately priced. But don't expect nothing more than your standard bar food  with the exception of their Awesome Fries.\n",
      "The burgers are delicious! The staff is pretty friendly but can be a little slow sometimes. Overall  it's a great place to eat whether you're grabbing food to go or want to sit down for dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great food  and its half off after 11 i think?  Good place to drink too  but it gets a minus 1 star because of certain packed nights with bad karaoke performances that makes me want to spontaniously combust.\n",
      "\n",
      "A typical college pub - food is good  beer selection not bad  service  while perhaps not as ideally attentive as I'd like  was acceptable. For the late-night  after-concert need for sustenance  particularly involving some fermented grains - this is your place in this neighborhood.\n",
      "I've been to New Deck many times with friends and have always had a good experiences here with regards to their food and beer selection.  They have a nice variety of appetizers that always come out pretty fast and their burgers are always really good  which i recommend and gravitate to when i can't decide what to eat.  happy hours bring us here often as you can't beat their 1$ off select draft beers and $5 appetizers.  Even though their awesome cheese fries are pretty awesome and not part of their HH appetizer list  i would recommend getting them.  so why the 2 star?  they recently added new items to their restaurant which i didn't particularly enjoy.  as usual  my friends and I were seated downstairs because of our larger party size.  My friend kept looking behind my shoulder  which i found odd because i was sitting with my back to the corner.  I then found out he had spotted a COCKROACH behind me walking around.  yikes!  my friend reached over and killed it.  ok....carry on.  few mins later  he was looking over my shoulder again and told me not to move.  there was another COCKROACH peeking over the ledge.  If i had leaned back another inch or two  it would've probably crawled on me.  again  my friend reached over and killed it and then brought it to the attention of one of the staff.  They apologized and assured us they would do something about it.  As we finished our meal  we found three more COCKROACHES by the window sill  a total of 5 during our 2 hours there.  As much as I love their food and HH's  i'm hesitant to come back until they remove this recent addition to their restaurant.  4 stars for food and happy hour  service is hit or miss and brings it down to a 3 stars  2 stars because of the COCKROACHES.  not a one star  because their food is still good.....\n",
      "Went for the first time yesterday for the psu temple game. Got there around one and it was crowded but not too crazy. We got lucky and got a table as someone got up. Our waitress was very nice. Good selection of beers and drinks  great food menu. I ordered the French dip sandwich with sweet potato fries. The rest of my party got wings which looked amazing !! Unfortunately my sandwich took awhile but the manager comped one of my drinks for me. The sandwich was very good however the roll was a bit dry and blahhhhhhhh. Could've been better. The only drink special was 5 for $30 buckets which wasn't even a good deal but we had a great time and will def be back\n",

      "120316 First time here. Usually while visiting in KOP we go to the Tilted Kilt. Today we tried the FOX & Hound. Nice clean quiet environment. We were seated promptly. Not crowded at all.  Our server Danielle was quick to greet us and was friendly. Service was very efficient and through. She promptly took our drink order. And after she brought our drinks back  she kept checking with us till we were ready to order food. I ordered the Double Sided Burger with the loaded Tater-Tots (get them loaded) and my wife had the Philadelphia Cheesesteak with Parmesan Fries. During the order wait  Danielle kept checking in on us.  We got our food in a timely manner. And I'll tell you what  look up cause Jesus is ah comin'. That Double Sided Burger was probably one of the best burgers I've had in my life. And my wife really enjoyed her cheesesteak. Now the ONLY downside we had was the booth we were sitting in. I think every spring was sprung in it. Very broken in. Other than that  FANTASTIC! Thanks Danielle. And to the Chef who cooked our sandwiches. Minstrels will be singing your praise. Thank you.\n",
      "Came with a larger group to celebrate an event. Our waitress was attentive  but the food was pretty awful. Pretty pricey and no dinner specials on the weekend if fine  but the chicken tenders came out small and burnt up with no flavor  and extra salt couldn't fix it. Other people said the burgers were bad as well  with crumbly buns and lack of flavor too. Fries were alright  but overall  this place isn't for food. Drinks were sweetened up a lot  but I had a few that were okay. In general  maybe not the best idea to eat  and even drinking gets expensive really quick. Won't be back for food.\n",
      "It is a good place to watch sports. It is not a place to go to have  a fancy dinner. Just watched the Flyers game and it was full in the big screen area and crowded in the big space area. Service was surprisingly excellent (maybe got lucky with the server). The food was good 4*. They have burgers  fried stuff and pizza. Maybe salad.\n",
      "I have always had a great time at Fox and Hound.  During both this year and last year's Phillies post season  i have enjoyed watching games here.  2.75 pints of everything they have on tap ( my fave  Stella) before 7 is a good deal.  The location in Center City is great  the staff is competent and overall it is a fun place to gather with your fellow sports fans.\n",
      "I rarely go to Fox and Hound because I prefer locally owned bars with good beer selections  but for a chain  F&H isn't bad. They have a decent beer selection (for a chain) and on Tuesdays  all beers are used to be $2 each. I've only eaten here a few times because the food is very average chain food - way too salty for my taste. If you're looking for a place to watch a sporting event  if it's on TV  it's probably on at F&H. Decent place to watch UFC. Bottom line: I'd probably only go to F&H to watch a sporting event  not to chill out with friends over some good beers and bar snacks.\n",
      "Big spacious sports bar  and for some reason I've never seen it get too packed. There are many TV screens here but none too big  particularly if you're sitting far from the bar. Still  its a good place to watch a game especially if you don't like being cramped with sweaty  rowdy sports fans.  And Monday Wings Nights are the bomb! $3.50 for 10 wings!! But it seems like the wings have gotten smaller  but nonetheless still a great deal.  Happy Hours (5-7 pm) are limited to beers only...boo.....\n",
      "Went back for Monday night football and sat at the bar. Service was much better and management took care of this issue. I would give it 3 1 2 stars because of the 50 cent wing special on Monday nights.\n",
      "Fox & Hound has a few big pros going for it. Are you an out-of-town sports fan? This is one of the few big sports bars in Philly. There are lots of TVs and NFL Sunday Ticket. Are you a Steelers fan? Then you are in the right place (though you have sacrificed some not insubstantial part of your soul to be a fan of that godforsaken travesty  but whatever  that's a different review). If you're an Eagles fan  you're better off going some other place where you can see the game without tons of obnoxious yellow & black jerseys and sad Bill Cowhler mustaches creeping you out.  The food is passable but I suspect it's shipped over from the Applebee's kitchen up the street. The burger I had pales in comparison to the many  many better varieties just blocks away (Good Dog  Misconduct  etc.) The spinach dip was covered in a thin layer of grease. Yuck.  On the plus side  they have a pretty good beer selection  and pint night is great.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am obsessed with this place. My favorite vegetarian Chinese place in Chinatown  Singapore  closed down  so I gave this place a try. The first time I ordered the steak for dinner and it was delicious.   I went for lunch the other day and the special was $6.75 and came with rice (no extra $ for brown)  a side (spring rolls  salad  fruit)  AND a soup (miso  hot & sour). All of that amazing food for $6.75! I got the kung pao tofu with peanuts and it was delicious. My friend got the \\as-you-wish\\\" which was like tofu sushi looking things? They looked amazing.   Service is quick and friendly. I would order pick up about 30min ahead to stay on safe side because it's all freshly made I'm pretty sure.   The interior is standard Chinese restaurant  spacious with booths. Nothing glamorous.\"\n",
      "RACIST. Just like Penangs. They treat Black people like crap. Every time I go  they remind me that it is vegetarian over and over again. My father has been a vegetarian for over 40 years. I know what  is vegetarian. The other day me and a friend went (my last time EVER) and the lady gave us burnt tofu. I have been eating tofu all my life. She claimed that we just wanted more food  when we all just tasted on piece each (only 3)  and agreed that it tasted burnt.  The waitor showed no respect  the manager showed no respect  and I have no respect for the establishment. If you are a person who belives in equality for all people regardless of race  you should really think twice about supporting this establishment.\n",
      "Holy hell this is by far and away the best vegetarian restaurant I've had the pleasure of patronizing. Take it from a lover of all things meats that Su Xing is delicious and does Chinese cuisine right. Had the three mushroom soup  eggplant tofu in garlic sauce  and chow mei fun singapore style noodles. Granted I hardly touched the tofu due to over ordering  but my lord those veggies  sauces  broth  and noodles were on point. Great hole in the wall that has me stuffed and smiling on the cheap!\n",
      "I had dinner here and I made the mistake of ordering an appetizer AND an entree. BY the time I was done with the scallion pancakes  I was pretty much full. I ordered the Taro potato knishes as an entree. For vegetarian food  it was really cheap and they gave me a huge portion I couldn't finish. BY the time I was done  I felt like a starchy knish myself. The flavor was ok. It was like any other fast food Chinese place - laden with orange sauce. I didn't really taste any taro since everything was deeply fried. The scallion pancakes were a bit stale and hard and the sauce was boring.  I would go here again if I was craving vegetarian Chinese food  but Philly has so many kinds of food I want to try  that it might take me a while to come back to Su Xing.\n",
      "I worked around the corner and could walk in and have the lunch special  eat it  and walk out in under an hour. They definitely move quickly to serve the business people that come in for meals. The lunch special is soup or salad  an entree  a bowl of rice  and a side  all for under 8 bucks or so.  If you're gluten free or have allergies  probably not a great place: the wait staff aren't super knowledgeable  and the menu can be vague as to what the fake meat is made of. You can however ask for any of the items without the sauce  which is basically steamed veggies... really good steamed veggies. And the miso is really good  if you can risk the possible barley. You can walk right past it unless you're looking for it  though... this place is a definite hole in the wall.\n",
      "Tasty and inexpensive. I often go here from lunch even though I am not a vegetarian - because the food is good  the service is very good and responsive  and you never have to wait for a table.   I particularly like the lunch special version of General Tso's tofu.\n",
      "Never disappoints! The lunch specials make it hard for me to stay away. I love to grab a small bite for a late lunch  and pick up dinner since I'm there. Genius idea right?\n",
      "We came here for lunch today and it was great. The three treasure vegetables was comprised of broccoli  cauliflower  carrots  shiitake  and celery in a savory and light garlic sauce. The cold sesame noodles had a delish peanut and sesame based sauce and my friend loved the mushroom delight lunch special. FYI - they have lunch specials on Saturday  which come with a soup and side - all for under $7. Service was pleasant and our window booth was very comfortable. I have a feeling that this will become my go-to healthy Chinese place come fall.\n",
      "We got delivery from here and were disappointed. Everything was very average  but based on these Yelp reviews  we thought we were going to get something exceptional. First of all  the delivery was not at all fast. We got our food an hour after we ordered. Secondly  the food was fine  but they forgot part of our order and as this was a delivery  we couldn't get that back. It was only a large side of rice  oh well. The portions are gigantic  so you do get a lot of food for the money that you put in.   Fried bananas: mushy and overripe bananas. Shakes: More watery than milky (could be due to delivery on a cold night) Creamy corn soup: It's like egg drop soup with corn -- delicious. Tofu Eggplant in garlic sauce: Generous portion  the tofu tasted good. Large strips of tofu that were fried and marinated in the garlic sauce along with the eggplants. I recommend this dish.  Maybe the dining experience is better when you dine-in?\n",
      "I love this place so much! The food is so fresh and delicious- and cheap! The portion sizes are generous enough to be shared by several people...but when my husband and I go  we always each order a dish so that we have plenty of left overs.  The service there is also very fast and friendly. We have always had great  efficient service.  Also  it's BYOB  which never hurts!\n",
      "The food is fantastic  the service isn't. I go there once every 2 weeks since they opened. The dam dam noodles are to die for. Basically  I have never had Chinese food as good as here. The service is slow  rude and inattentive. The fact that the place is becoming more and more popular is not helping. The young lady behind the counter has a bad attitude and the older woman s just too slow and sloppy. Go there for the food but don't expect efficiency.\n",
      "3.5 stars! Service is friendly here! (better than the old city site). Dan dan noodles kick butt! Delicious  spicy  and can't get enough. Spicy Cucumbers are amazing. SO crunchy and spicy Dry pots are good  but didn't wow me. Dry pepper style chicken is awesome! Crunchy moist chicken :) Salt N Pepper shirmp was delicious!  Nice place in manayunk. Great good. BYO:)\n",
      "My opinion...food and service was horrible. I'm very surprised this place has such a high rating??  Service is one of the worst restaurants I have been to  staff barely acknowledges you when entering  when they do greet you its insincere  took another tables order before mine even though I had been sitting 5 min before they entered.   Ok  so service I can get over if the food is good enough  well man was I let down  dumpling were soooo sorry I wish I would have taken a picture...there was next to NO filling and all dough (they should be embarrassed to serve that to anyone)  the rest of the food Chili Sauce Chicken was OILY and OVERSEASONED  I can cook chicken in oil and put chili flakes overtop and call it Chili Sauce Chicken...WoW just sad!   Only good thing about this place was BYOB...good thing I had Coronas to wash out the taste from my mouth...this place need to go on Restaurant Impossible.    Side note...I was told the Old city location is better\n",
      "CNN approved? should've been a warning sign.  slow service  disorganized  short-staffed  can't even talk about the food b c we never got our order!\n",
      "I tried this place out again  when our other plans fell through. I must applaud them for fitting us in on a busy night (New Years Eve) and we didn't have a reservation but that's all I will applaud them for.  I tried the mung bean noodles this time  thinking that maybe it was what I had before. While the dish was good  albeit salty  it's the after effects that make me never want to go back.  When I got dressed that evening  my dress was a bit big on me. I'm a small person. It was loose  which isn't abnormal. I can wear kids clothes.   When I got to the bar we were going to after  my entire body had swelled to the point of no return for that night. My dress was tight and I felt disgusting. I couldn't move. Did I eat too much? No. I didn't eat my entire meal either. I never eat it all in one sitting. I actually ended up going home early and my New Year's Eve was ruined. The only plus was that my entire meal cost me just $10.  I bet the meal would taste just as good with half the salt. Ease up in the kitchen back there. No need to cause hypertension!\n",
      "The dan dan noodles are ridiculous. The spicy crispy cucumbers are also amazing - I need to figure out how to make cucumbers taste this good. I've tried a bunch of their main dishes and I always end up picking around the meat because it grosses me out for some reason. Also  the service is not always the best. When you walk in sometimes it's awkward because no one greets you and you are kind of just standing there in the middle of the dining room. But the dan dan noodles literally make up for anything negative I could say about this place.\n",
      "Loved the food!   Needs a better bathroom. Fix it up.  Service a bit lax at lunch.  Crispy rice shrimp. Gonna come back.\n",
      "Went here last night and it was a great experience. They were packed but were able to get us a table for four within 5 minutes. It was a little awkward setup  but worked out fine and we were happy to not have to wait long. We ordered a lot and loved all of the food. Dan Dan noodles  pork belly  won ton soup  chicken garlic sauce  Kung pao...etc. all good. It's great for a family style meal with friends too...order a bunch and try it all. Also  they are great about food allergies and made my orders gluten free. Love that is a byob! Would def recommend and will go back.\n",

      "I really want to like Sang Kee (Chestnut location) having readirave reviews for the one in Chinatown and was going to go there but our hotel was at the Sheraton on Chestnut  and we noticed that there was a Sang Kee in the hotel (Bonus!)  I asked the host who confirmed that it's the same resto as the one in Chinatown but added that it's a bit \\geared\\\" towards this area which I wasn't sure what he meant at first.  This should have been a red flag for me but I was dying to try their peking duck  lobster  crab  etc and didn't want to trek back to Chinatown and find parking  etc....We got in at 6pm Sun for dinner (no waiting) and it was half full at that time.    The waiter brought ice water and menus (I was expecting some hot tea) but looked around and saw that almost all the tables had water so I opted out for asking since tea will probably be $$.   It's funny that they have huge billboards of their menus outside showcasing lobsters  crab  fried fish  and I was so hoping to order these but the sit down menus had all these items crossed out with sharpies so I think that it was meant for the Chinatown chain only.    I asked about the 1/2 peking duck ($19) and the waiter said it comes with 4 pancakes (4?!?!  r u kidding? flag #2).  I asked what they do with the bones since the places I go they use to bones either to make soup or sauté it with garlic and he said you don't get the bones (flag # 3).  We decided not to order the duck and ordered 4 dishes.  Crispy tofu with XO sauce (tofu was not crispy (it was fried) and then they slather it with the XO/soy sauce so it was soft and salty.  It was cooked with some fried green beans (which links to the 2nd dish).  Next was the green beans with pork and garlic which looked and tasted like the first dish we ordered.  Having been a part-time waiter in my previous life  if someone were ordering something with same ingredients I would have suggested that they order something else since it would taste the same (the client would really appreciate this and that translates to extra tips $$).    General Tao's chicken  was next and it was ok amid not seeing any red peppers or chili peppers but 4-5 pcs of bok choy in it's place.   It wasn't too doughy and the kids enjoyed it.  Lastly we had the clams with black bean sauce.  Lots of missing clams in the shells  broken shells  and it was a bit sandy.  Oh did I mentioned that they used red onions and green peppers?  Why red onions?   My observations and experiences in many authentic Chinese resto's  uses  red peppers  green onions and chili peppers in this dish.     Fresh white rice was complimentary with the meal which was good.   Service was prompt  there were lots of waiters but my glass was never refilled (lost a star).    Total for 4 dishes came to $54 with tax.  I think they use alot of msg as my mouth was dry and thirsty 30 mins after dinner.  As I looked across the room it was clear to me what the host meant by catering to this area.  It was mostly university students.   Shame on you Sank Kee for thinking that their palates are bad or do you think you have a  monopoly so you can cook however you want to?  I'm a bit hesitant to try the Sang Kee in Chinatown but my curiosity will kill me so I will go on my next trip down to Philly and if it's the same then shame on me!\"\n",
      "I love sangkee. The women (and men) at the cash register are some of my favorite people because they recognize me  ask how I am and we've exchanged names and small conversation. This is not a given for a hotel restaurant that sees tons of college/grad students walking in all day. Whenever I need to get dinner or lunch close to campus  this is where I go (over Chattime/Ochatto) because I know they are friendly.   Their food is not the best in the entire universe  but it is quite good (although this probably depends on what you get). There are even several dishes for which my Chinese friends have given their stamp of approval (the chestnut chicken  the boiled flounder in szechuan sauce). I go here too many times  but I am always happy with their service and the food.   My favorites  besides the chicken and flounder mentioned above  are the braised beef rice bowl  the Taiwanese pork belly rice bowl  the seafood pan fried noodles and the singaporean noodles. I also like to get their house special fried rice  but it gets a little oily.\n",
      "Nice place...had my favorite sauce garlic black bean...with clams...sauce was tasty  clams big and plentiful...brown rice was cooked well...also had the shrimp corn chowder...which is probably basically some type of egg drop soup that they put corn...not a chowder but good nonetheless...will stop in again\n",
      "I ordered the shanghai dumpling and regret it so much afterwards. It was hard! Extra chewy  it's like they microwave it and put it in a steamer plate. It taste the same as the frozen ones I bought from the frozen aisle in Asian supermarket. 8 pieces here cost $6.50 and for half that price you can get the same thing from an Asian market.  Don't come here for Chinese food  you can do better with your time and money.\n",
      "Tasty noodle house located in the Sheraton University City Hotel.  Full evenings with lots of people dining in.  Food was fresh  large portions and hot.  Noodle bowl variety is plentiful and varied.    Lots of delicious choices.  Pan fried noodles are decadent and melt in your mouth.  Desserts are basic- could be improved.  Daily specials are noteworthy and seasonal.  My be hard to find a seat during happy hour  dinner hours but you'll get a seat quickly.  Give it a try.  Nice menu  lots of choices for any taste and a solid dining experience.\n",
      "I ordered the stewed vegetables and tofu in coconut curry broth  and it was good. The portions were large  and this dish was super spicy (enjoyed it nonetheless). The sesame chicken is well breaded and not drowning in sauce (definitely a plus)  and the congee is  well  plain congee (don't get it).  It was packed when I came at 9PM on a Wednesday night  but the servers are friendly and quick!\n",
      "\n",
      "Sangkee has solid Chinese food. I ordered a special - the braised chicken in a clay pot - and it was decent. Chicken was succulent  not drowning in sauce  and the various vegetables (water cress  leek  mushrooms  etc.) were nice and tender. This dish was a bit bland  so the server politely provided sriracha sauce upon request.  With regards to karaoke  Sangkee doesn't charge too much per hour! (I think it's 40ish an hour for a room?) Come with decent sized group  order drinks before coming  and the price is well worth it! Plus  they have a good selection of English songs  which is always a plus  haha.\n",
      "Came here for a quick dinner on a Friday night  and wasn't expecting much. Glad I had low expectations! Ordered the steamed chicken dumplings and the lemon grass chicken rice bowl. The dumplings were not exciting  and I thought the sauce was a bit sour. The rice bowl redeemed the dumplings a bit  but it wasn't as awesome as I wanted it to be. Service was really slow and nonexistent  but the whole restaurant was pretty busy and crowded. The place is large with most of the crowd being college students and probably hotel guests. Parking was not an issue  which was nice!  Personally  I like the ambiance and service at the Wynnewood location!\n",
      "Summary: Run-of-the-mill Americanized Chinese Food  Sang Kee is one of the few 'classy' looking Chinese joints in UC Philadelphia  along with the newly opened Han Dynasty University City. Unfortunately  Sang Kee seems to have gone the route of 'Americanizing' their food and deviating from traditional fare.  The vegetable spring rolls are good  albeit overpriced at 1$ per roll (for a very small one). That being said  I do give them credit for the fact that it does taste good  and I personally liked it.   On the other hand  the vegetable fried rice was absolutely not worth the money. It tasted like some veggies and rice had been steamed in a microwave and served on a plate  and after reading other reviews and hearing about Sang Kee's tendencies to employ microwaves  I wouldn't be surprised if that was indeed the case.   All that being said  Sang Kee does get credit for their Oriental Eggplant in Garlic Sauce and their Vegetable Pad Thai. Both tasted fantastic  and while they weren't authentic  per se  they still had done a wonderful adaptation to the American palate.  Service was hit or miss. Some times you get great servers  and yet other times you get nasty servers who are downright rude. Luck of the draw  I guess. Regardless  depending on what you order  the meal can still be worth it.  If you're really looking for traditional far-eastern food  check out Han Dynasty or Banana Leaf  both of which are wonderful restaurants as well. Han Dynasty is just a few blocks away  and Banana Leaf is down in Center City.\n",
      "I am giving Dante & Luigi's top honors for many reasons. My boyfriend & I were in Philly for our 2 year anniversary & this place caught my eye from the looks of it alone. Classy & super clean. Hostess & waiter were extremely nice & even the bus boy came over a few times to see how we enjoyed the food etc. Now to the food  I had Ravioli's & he had Chicken Francese & they were both out of this world! I was actually upset we didn't live closer so I could have it again! This is the place to go for delicious & reasonably priced Italian food. So romantic  perfect for our special day!\n",
      "Took out of town relatives back to this Bella Vista stalwart.  You really can't go wrong for good  solid Italian food.  Huge veal cutlets.  Excellent sea food marinara.  Good old fashioned  reliable Italian food  in unpretentious setting  without a bunch of obnoxious people.  Great for a Sunday night  in particular.\n",
      "The ambience is nice and romantic  but the food is only \\ok\\\". I've had my fair share of Italian cuisine domestically and internationally and I have to the say the food here falls short. There's a ton of charm and history with the place but the food was overly salty. The soup  pasta  the meats were all very salty. I assume some people would consider that flavorful  I felt different. I think it's back to Radicchio.\"\n",
      "Was my first time here last night. I enjoyed it but was not wowed by the food.  It's not that it wasn't very good  just that I was not amazed.  But it was very good food and I would definitely recommend it to anyone for a date.  I ordered the clams in the white sauce for the appetizer and was not amazed by it.  I would recommend the mussels instead.  My main appetizer was the risotto with jumbo shrimp a and clams.  Was good but I have had better risotto from the frozen section at trader joe's to be honest.  My dessert was the tira misu.   Was very good.  As for the decor  the place is nicely decorated.  The main dining room is a bit small and the noise is on the louder side.  It's better for conversation at this noise level as you can talk without whispering. It would have been better if there was more spacing between the tables.  I'll be coming back at some point.    FYI. This is the oldest Italian restaurant in Philly.  Founded in 1899\n",
      "Awesome italian food.  The waiter was very attentive  and considerate to our needs.  I would recommend it  and I will be going back.\n",
      "My wife & I went here for Valentine's dinner..........WOW!! Service was impeccable  food was absolutely 1st rate. We shared a crabmeat & portabella mushroom appetizer(which was delicious)   my wife had veal medallions rollatini which she enjoyed immensely & I had the bronzino(Mediterranean sea bass) stuffed w/ lobster rizzoto  which was also amazing. We also shared a cannoli for desert  which was the best cannoli I've ever had  it literally melted in my mouth. I'm thinking this will be our Valentine's spot imperpetuem.  Just make sure you make a reservation(some poor schlub actually walked in off the street ON VALENTINE'S WEEKEND & expected to get a table!! I burst out laughing!!)) & bring plenty of cash  dinner for 2 was around $140 w/ drinks before tip  they do take credit cards  but tack on 3%!!   NOTE: I don't know how but this review wound up on Ristorante Panorma's page. I've never been there. I removed that review. Dante & Luigi's is where we went  & very glad of it.  EDIT: My wife  son  & I went here for a surprise Father's Day dinner on 6/15/13  & the same thing I'm now going to bring up happened the 1st time: the valet parking leaves a little to be desired. 1st off  my wife was driving both times  & both times we had to search out the valet  who WAS STANDING ON THE CURB RIGHT IN FONT OF D & L'S. A good valet will open a door for a customer  especially a woman. The \\Tip-O-Meter\\\" was running  dude!! Secondly  when your parking a block away  why oh why does it take so damn long to get my car?? I mean 20 minutes. Really? And they charge $18  a wee bit steep  especially early in the day......not taking anything away from D & L's food or service wise  it's impeccable  but they may want to re-think the whole valet parking deal w/ whomever they are dealing w/ now & get somebody else in the near future.  NOTE: D&L's have since changed the valet they use.....MUCH improved.  EDIT: Went back here for Valentine's dinner on Sunday  2/13....everything great as usual  but the one complaint I do have is that this is supposed to be fine dining....why do they allow schlubs dressed in jogging suits/sweats/yoga pants? If I'm paying top dollar for a meal  I don't need to see some bozo & his family looking like they just rolled into McDonald's. Whatever happened to \\\"Proper Attire Required\\\"? You don't want to get dressed up to go to dinner  fine....go to Wendy's or The Melrose Diner....but in the end  I do blame the management for this....They really should enforce a dress code. If you're paying $200 for dinner  then Joe Schmo should be turned away for looking like an unmade bed.\"\n",
      "I have heard and read great reviews from many people about Dante & Luigi's  I was not disappointed. Every entree we had was delicious  the apps. and desserts were just as good. I've had better meals  but not by much  and never at this price point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't try to bring a young child here  because they don't have highchairs or booster seats for little kids. So much for families being welcome... as long as your kids are old enough to sit in regular chairs I guess. Was pretty irritating to be turned away after braving a pretty nasty rainstorm specifically to go here on our last night in Philadelphia.\n",
      "I'm a spoiled New Yorker  what can I say?  When I heard this was the oldest Italian restaurant in Philly  I had high expectations. When I saw the prices  I had higher expectations. Expectations not met.  I had the spaghetti with bolognese sauce which was good but I have had so much better. I think the sauce was the most disappointing part of the meal.  The bread served in the beginning is fresh and I did appreciate the sweetness of the vinegar to accompany the olive oil. The sautéed spinach was too bitter  but the Italian sweet sausages I tried were good.   This is a descent place but I mean descent and I had expected 5 stars.\n",
      "(Let it be known this review is the prelude to a pickup order that's going to be placed immediately after submitting it. )  After a 2.5 month wait  I had the pleasure of having some fantastic food here. I really enjoyed this place and although I need to try it a few more times  it's likely this could supplant DSG as my go-to spot. It's also two blocks closer to mi casa y workplace. We need more food closer to Broad Street that's not of the  Golden Arches and sub-par pizza variety. This is one step closer to achieving this dream.   Oh yes  the food: _________________________________ Original Egg Roll: The truth.   House Pork Buns: Could eat this thrice daily no problem. So good.  Salt & Pepper Shrimp: Tasty. They have eyes. They are watching you. Judging you.   Shrimp Shumai: The best I've had in the city  maybe ever (no really maybe).  Scallion Pancakes: Very tasty and not super-greasy.  Minced Beef Dumpling Soup: Not bad  only ordered it because 1/3 of our triumvirate that day keeps kosher.  Chinese Broccoli: Always order Chinese Broccoli. Always. They will test your skills with a chopstick a la Mr Miyagi.  Welcome Nom Wah. It's a pleasure to have you. _________________________________ Eat here now  eat here often.  - ß\n",
      "First timer  excellent food  lovely staff and atmosphere.  Can't wait to go again and try more flavors\n",
      "A good place to get Dim Sum (not the cart kind) when you are craving Chinese food! The sticky rice in lotus leaf and steamed pork buns were delicious. Not my favorite soup dumplings I've had  however. Atmosphere was nice and all the food tasted very fresh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good food but unbelievably the chef and manager started screaming at each other in the middle of the restaurant in chinese  only to end the yelling with the chef yelling WTF in English. There were young kids in the restaurant for crying out loud. The manager then goes back into the kitchen and yells some more. Up until that point it was a nice atmosphere and decent dim sum but that was just plain indecent. Like out of a movie or something. Settle your differences in private  not the middle of the restaurant while your patrons are eating.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've frequent Nom Wah in NYC so when in Philly  I needed to stop by this establishment. I went on a rainy Tuesday afternoon and it was a bit quiet. The decor was age old but new aged if that makes any sense. We got the dumpling sample  roast pork bun  spring rolls  shrimp rice rolls and pork sui mai. All were cooked steamed to order which meant the food was piping hot. They also have a good selection of beers and a full bar. Dimsum and drinks??? I wouldn't decline that invite any time.\n",
      "The dim sums were delicious  favorite was the shrimp shumai and the Shanghainese soup dumplings. The friend noodle was a bit too oily for me but the house special fried rice was delicious. We made a reservation through opentable and put table wasn't ready when we got there so waitress about 20 mins. All in all a good experience. Also saw that it was BYOB\n",
      "Undoubtedly the best traditional dim sum place in Ctown Philly. The dim sum is made to order  you pick from a wide selection of traditional dim sum menu. Everything we ordered was solid/above average (fried noodles in soy sauce  turnip cake in xo sauce   spare ribs  fried shrimp balls  and shrimp rice rolls).  Price is above average but you get what you pay for. We ended up dropping $50 between 2 adults and a toddler but left mighty full (we prob over ordered). The interior is classy and more importantly  clean. Chinese lanterns hang overhead with comfortable seating and a full bar to boot.  Nom Wah caters to everyone  young and old. Those yearning for traditional dim sum appetizers yet dislike the old way of doing things (there are no old ladies wheeling carts of overcooked food here  and that's a good thing  folks).  Located on the outskirts of Ctown  which is another plus for those wanting to avoid driving through the hustle & bustle of Ctown.\n",

      "Mmmm. Just had a really great lunch here. It's a perfect mix between a sit-down lunch and a food truck lunch. Quick  and seriously delicious  but you can also sit. Not cheap  though...but worth it.   I had a spicy pork taco (2 minimum  so I shared) and seriously? I could have eaten 4 of them. The tortilla  which is clearly not exactly a tortilla  is almost sweet and it plays so well with the flavors of the spicy korean pork. And the sauce...that sauce is talk with your mouth full \\dis is soo good\\\" type of sauce. Going to get a bottle for home...  I also had the Dak Bulgogi (spicy chicken bulgogi) and it was also really good - but I did a lot of sauce dipping  making it even better. My rice was a little on the sticky side  but it was still a really solid lunch. My bf got the spciy pork rice dish in a stone bowl (lunch special 3) and it was also tasty.   Service was fast  and good. I'm a fan.\"\n",
      "This place is very quick service and the owner and people working there are very accommodating. We ordered the vegetable steamed dumplings and they were good. It came with some edamame and some carrots which was a little strange. We also ordered the dol sot bibimbap  the soon duboo and the bulgogi. The food was pretty good  the meat could have been a little more flavored. I also wish they had spinach instead of romaine lettuce in the bibimbap. Overall  I'd go back. Not mind blowing  but does the job if you want some quick Korean.\n",
      "Pretty good dol sot bibimbap: piping hot (seriously steaming!)  but the flavor was lacking something. Great kim chi and loved the pickled radish and cucumber. Overall  a little pricey for what you get  but good for a Korean-food craving!\n",
      "Kimchi Pancakes - good flavors   a little soggy. Beef Bibimbop in Sizzling Bowl - fresh ingredients yum!  Thanks Zagat!\n",
      "THIS PLACE SERVES OVERPRICED  BLAND  LESS-THAN-MEDIOCRE FOOD. UUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. Don't waste your money here.\n",
      "Giwa Taco. That's all that needs to be said.  Amazing.  Not very well air conditioned and simple small venue  but the price is extremely nice.  And the food is very good.\n",
      "Mmmbibimbop! Such simple food  but delicious. Lunch time drop by at this tiny place  got the bibimbop with tofu  friend got it without. A delight for lunch  not too slow (not too quick either  though). You may have a problem finding a seat  and your pocketbook will be a bit lighter (but your stomach will be heavier so it all balances out)  but a good treat to forget about work for a while. It is definitely overpriced for what you get  so I won't be getting here too often  but I will return. If it was more reasonably priced  I'd give it 4 stars.\n",
      "I love this place! I think I must come here every week  maybe even twice a week sometimes.  The food is always fresh and flavorful  the staff is really nice  and the food is served quick.    I like their Dak Bulgogi (spicy marinated chicken) and their buckwheat noodles (only available during the summer). Their new dish  Giwa Taco  is threatening to be a new fav!    Most dishes are served with a little kimchee and pickled vegetables on the side.  Yum!\n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted to like this place  I really did. Since moving to Philly  I've missed good ol' Korean food.  This place reminded me of a restaurant near our dorms when I studied abroad in Seoul  so I had high hopes.  Unfortunately  the food kinda fell flat. Service was good and quick  but my dol sot bibimbap was pretty flavorless  even with the pepper sauce. I was expecting bulgogi for the meat  but it tasted like flavorless beef. My fiance's bulgogi was definitely better. I'll try that next time  if we return.\n",
      "I feel the need to update this review based on an experience had here last evening.  The service was non-existent.  It took 15 minutes for water and someone to open our wine  20 minutes to order  20 more minutes for the soup  and then half of our group of foud were given their entrees and the other two waited 15 minutes for theirs.  Also  one of the late entrees was completely the wrong dish.  When this was brought to their attention they didn't even apologize.  It is one thing to be short staffed and acknowledge that the service is suffering and while I don't expect a fine dining experience at these establishments-- they did not apologize or even recognize that there was a problem with the timing/service.  Also-- portions were incredibly inconsistent.  One of our party got drunken noodles  which are ordered often and are always great but there was 1/3 of the usual size dish.    I will not be back.\n",
      "Not the most decorated place  but great food  great hospitality...its BYOB so ensure you get your \\stuff\\\"...Thai sausage with the ginger julian is one of my favorite...decent menu...\"\n",

      "3 years ago  I couldn't stop coming to Erawan.  Now  I can hardly finish my dish because it's doused in sugar.  They also don't seem to want to listen when I ask for extra spicy.  Unfortunately  even a bunch of hot chillies may not be able to mask how sugary every single dish they serve has become  from the pad thai to their curries to their duck entree.\n",
      "After being at the chinatown location  I was skeptical when my friend picked this spot for her bday dinner  but it turned out a lot better than their other location. I'm confused why it was such an upgrade  as it's the same restaurant as the other location  but the food here was a lot more flavorful.   We came with a huge group of 20 something people and they were pretty nice in dealing with our rowdy group of deliquents. I know it's very difficult for a kitchen to get 20 plates out at once but this place would get more like 3.5 stars if possible because some dishes came out 45 minutes before others and they were in the same \\hot noodle dish\\\" category. They had a full house and other large parties so its understandable  but 45 mins between similar dishes is pretty rough stuff.  The atmosphere was average and service were pretty nice  and it seemed clean enough. Nothing spectacular but I'd come back. Our food was pretty delicious so I have to hand it to them on stepping up their game there. I got pad see ew which definitely rocked and all my friends had nice looking plates. I was bitter with the other location's pad thai that only had half the normal ingredients  but this location included the usual tasty works. nice job guys. give the chinatown location some pointers.  Also  thanks for being byob and opening countless bottles of wine for us  as we waved bottles at random workers in far from sober states.\"\n",
      "Food here is good  but rude service and understaffed. The couple times I have taken out from Erawan I have been left standing by the front desk for at least 10 minutes without even being acknowledged (apparently the phone calls coming in were more important than a paying customer trying to pick up his food).\n",
      "Erawan Thai is delicious  affordable  and probably one of my favorite lunch destinations.   Erawan is actually the first place I've tasted Thai cuisine. I've compared it to a handful of other restaurants in the neighborhood and still prefer it. Its kind of a monthly voyage to grab lunch here during work for me. I'd gladly walk across the walnut street bridge in the freezing cold to warm up with their three course lunch special. I prefer to eat in rather than bring it back to work with me  although its the same great taste without the relaxing atmosphere.  Erawan is a good choice  for grabbing a quick Thai lunch. I recommend the drunken noodles  they're totally my favorite.\n",
      "I have mixed feeling about Erawan.   I like the food here very much.  I think the service has a good heart.  The problem on my last two visits (both Friday nights) is that there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant.  Our dinner took about 2 hours from start to finish.  Just hire more service and this could be a 4-5 star place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to check out Love & Honey after hearing that Questlove endorsed them. I grabbed my friend Myron who was visiting from out of town and we set off for Front Street. As a black woman whose family hails from the South  I'm genetically engineered to be skeptical of any fried chicken not prepared by someone's black grandmother or Aunt Johnnie Mae. I took a deep breath  crossed the threshold walked to the counter and placed my order. The chicken isn't prepared until you place your order so there's a bit of a wait. Fast forward to me digging into my box of chicken - this is actually good! The chicken was juicy and seasoned well. The skin was nice and crisp! The piece de resistance  however  was the cornbread with honey butter. It was damn good! Not slap yo mama good but when I see my mother this weekend we will have words. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because you can't choose all white or all dark meat. I detest chicken breast with every fiber of my being so this was almost a deal breaker for me. Luckily  Myron isn't picky about his chicken so he graciously traded his thigh for my breast. If you get the chance  do stop by  you'll be glad you did.\n",

      "Chicken is done right - super crispy and delicious batter. Rivals the fried chicken at Lukoil (anyone who doesn't know  their chicken is out of sight  don't judge a book by its cover) Very friendly staff even though it was their hectic grand opening. A few cons - Mac and cheese was surprisingly lackluster. Go with pimento cheese spread instead. Also they ran out of cornbread which I'm chalking up to being a crazy grand opening.\n",
      "I found the food very good here!  Yes  the chicken was fantastic  as was cornbread  shells and cheese and collard greens.  I also had the banana pudding  which was rich and creamy.  I also tried the sweet potato pie  which was also very good.  Both desserts had fresh whipped cream. Everything was homemade  fresh and tasty.  I hope they can maintain this high quality of food.\n",
      "First time coming here! I got a 6-piece chicken with every side they offer (except the coleslaw). The food was absolutely amazing. I could not have asked for a more authentic dining experience. I ordered using Caviar with a $10 off voucher  but would have paid full price if I knew how amazing the food was. I recommend this if you are looking for homemade comfort food!   I've been using Caviar to get delivery from my favorite restaurants.

      "This food is life-changing. My wife works nearby and if I'm especially nice to her she'll grab me a 3 piece and cornbread. Also  the butter is more than likely fortified with narcotics because I'm most definitely addicted!\n",
      "The fried chicken was amazing! Fried chicken is hard to get right (not too greasy  not over cooked  consistent crunchiness of the coating)... well  they nailed it. The mac and cheese was also delicious. The banana pudding was a huge surprise (figured - how good could it be?) - Uh-mazing. This came as a recommendation   so I glad I took it. The restaurant has a cute layout - geared a little more to take out  but there are seats available. No beer wine  but that may be a blessing given you won't have any room left!\n",
      "I don't know where it all went wrong  maybe it was a bad batch but this chicken is not good. There's was no flakiness  and it was poorly seasoned. All I taste is the overwhelming flavor of celery seed and white pepper. Couldn't even eat the skin...very disappointed...drove all the way from Jersey\n",
      "\n",
      "Just went there tonight with my wife for a nice dinner. The food was incredible! I had the NY STRIP and she had the lamb  and both were absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly. The service was also great  the waiter messed up a tiny bit our order so he got us 2 free dessert :) super nice! And if you have room for dessert  don't even think twice and order the fried oreos!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yum  yum yummmmmmmmmmm. My man candy and I went to entree for restaurant week and both have a lovely evening.  For appe-tits (hehe) we got the balsamic calamari which was fresh and tart and fantastic. Came with a bunch of different sriracha sauces too which of course complemented the calamari perfectly. We also got the prosciutto wrapped dates stuffed with gorgonzola. Really rich and meaty in texture  and tasted amazing when you dipped it in their balsamic dipping sauce that came with the bread (oh yea  they give free bread and olive oil :) I found this to be a little on the rich side on it's own  but dip it in the sweet balsamic and it really changes things.  For dinner  I had the duck with a sun dried tomato and cherry sauce which came with purple potatoes and mushrooms. Mmm mmm  mmmm under the sun  I was a happy camper. The duck was crispy  tender  and perfectly cool while the sauce really complimented it perfectly. The potatoes were tender and soaked up the sauce really nicely.  Handsome pants had the chicken which is apparently the signature dish at entree. I don't know what it was spiced it but it had a morroccan flavor to it. Came with delicious mashed potatoes too.   For dessert we got the white chocolate creme brulee and the limencello cake. The limencello cake was lemon cake with cheese cake layering and the creme brulee was just delicious. Both were really great  but seriously could use a cup of coffee. Veryyyy decadent desserts after a heavy meal.   Our waitress was also really great! She recognized our needs and put up with our indecisiveness  but was not over bearing. Our table unfortunately was right in front of the door so we were a bit cold  but that did not affect my dining experience.  Definitely would go here again!\n",
      "We stumbled upon Entree BYOB by accident when the BYOB we had planned to go to was closed due to a family emergency. Lucky for us  they were able to accommodate our party of 4 at 8pm with no reservation--on a Saturday night no less!  We absolutely couldn't have asked for a better experience--we were there to celebrate our good friends' recent engagement and the menu had plenty of options to get us each excited. We opted for the $40 tasting menu which turned out to be a fabulous deal (especially since we had our own wine!). To start  we sampled each of the starters: The Wedge Salad (with a gorgonzola dressing and crispy bacon)  The Arugula Salad (with grapefruit  peaches  and nuts)  and the Fried Calamari. Both of the salads were tasty and were dressed perfectly. My husband had the calamari and said it was the absolute best he has had in Philadelphia. Considering he rarely exaggerates  I would call that a Wow dish! For our entrees we enjoyed the Duck Breast  NY Strip with Mashed Potatoes and Asparagus  and the happy couple both had the Halibut. My steak was prepared perfectly  albeit a bit fatty for my taste but still quite delicious. The mashed potatoes and asparagus were perfectly seasoned and prepared. Yum! Husband had the duck and said it was great! The real show stopper though was the Halibut. Although I am not a seafood eater personally  I was almost tempted to try it just because they raved so highly about it (although I am not sure they would have wanted to share! haha!) On our walk back home I think they brought it up twice--they really were impressed! Finally  dessert. It was a nice touch that dessert was included as part of the tasting menu. Hubby and I had the fried oreos and our friends shared the nutella cannoli and limencello cake. The oreos were pretty good (I think I don't want to have liked them as much as I did) and the nutella cannolli was described as \\good but rich!\\\" Overall an A+ experience and we would absolutely return to enjoy their seasonal menu on another occasion. Highly recommend!\"\n",
      "Had a wonderful dinner last Entree last night.  Great new BYOB to the Philadelphia area.   Service was outstanding and the staff made ever effort to make the evening wonderful.  We had the duck spring rolls  strip steak (one of the best steaks I've had in a while)  and the chicken dish.  Loved that several dishes on the menu had goat cheese - my favorite cheese.   Get the duck confit spring rolls!  Dessert was also great too.  Lastly chef was accommodating and switched out a side dish that came with our steak.  Very affordable for city dining.   Can't wait to go back!\n",
      "Went there last night after reading all the excellent reviews.  The food was delicious (had the calamari and duck breast).  However  the small space did pose a problem- we had a reservation but ended up waiting 15+ minutes to sit because another table was late for their reservation.  The wait staff were friendly about it but it did put a bit of a damper on the beginning of our meal.  However  a good neighborhood byo if its not too crowded.\n",
      "I had the pleasure of eating at Entrée BYOB Saturday 6/11/2016.   It was simply amazing!  From my appetizer the wedge salad to my meal of NY Strip Steak w/ Asparagus and Mashed potatoes topped off with crème brûlée as my desert. It was seasoned to perfection.   Now  while great food is expected at any restaurant worth their salt. What took the experience over the top was the attentive and friendly staff. Everyone was anxious to serve and nothing was \\too much\\\" for them.   To the chef/owner Kevin  I cannot wait to bring my wife back to experience this previously unknown gem.  To the staff that was so gracious and caring  continue to put the customers first  continuing enjoying what you do and each other because the camaraderie amongst you is what makes this establishment unique.

      "My wife and I went there for restaurant week and had a great meal with outstanding service.  We arrived on time for our reservation and were promptly seated.  Our server Kim explained the restaurant week menu to us and we ordered different meals.  My wife had the arugula salad  the scallops entree  and a dessert with lady fingers  espresso and vanilla ice cream.  I had the shrimp with habanero and sweet sauce  the Bronzino and the Creme Brûlée.  The meal was one of the best we have had in recent years and we eat out all of the time.  The only thing better than the food was the outstanding service by our server Kim and the team at entree.  Kim could not have been nicer.  Her service was courteous  efficient and unobtrusive.  Great spot with a hip young vibe that us older folks really enjoyed  this is now high up on our list and we will now come here often.\n",
      "There is nothing you can do wrong at this place  I've gotten almost everything on the menu and they are all fantastic.  My favorites - coronation chicken (salad or sandwich)  Mac and cheese  Shackamaxon. The only downside is that you'll usually run into a wait  but it's definitely worth it. If the weather is nice  ask to sit in the back patio.\n",
      "Maybe prioritizing your to-go business while leaving your dine-in guests high and dry isn't the best approach to brunch. Not only does it make the experience incredibly obnoxious  but it hurts your waitstaff. No one wants to tip when they sit for 45 minutes+ for a couple eggs  especially when they get no updates of effort to alleviate the situation. By the way  \\it'll be up as soon as possible\\\" doesn't help.  This experience was a little weird  in that shortly after writing my initial thoughts  the owner came out and apologized for the wait and let us know our food would be out shortly and it would be free.  Now  the food was dynamite. Really lovely. And yes  the wait was brutal and the lack of info for so long of it was unfortunate. But I actually feel like taking care of our entire check was a bit of an overreaction. People will wait for good food. You just have to make the wait enjoyable. Offer a free cupcake or coffee or other treat. Costs less and keeps everyone happy to be there.  The food will bring us back and I'll update the stars (assuming the experience improves). Till then!\"\n",

      "One of the best places for lunch in the city. The quality of the food is superb and creative. Salads  sandwiches  grilled cheese: all good here.\n",
      "Rudeness.  Pure rudeness from the owner.  I wish I could give negatives stars. My friend and I had just bought a lemon bar (the quality was okay  nothing to die for  it was like Jell-O Brand lemon pudding with thick crust).  We were sitting out front at the one table with two chairs.  I had bought something across the street but was not eating it. Long story short: the owner came out and confronted us for sitting there.    \\MAY I HELP YOU?\\\"  \\\"No  thank you  we're just sitting here.\\\"   \\\"THIS IS FOR CUSTOMERS ONLY!\\\"  \\\"Yes  we just bought something from here and ate it.\\\"  [Pointing] \\\"THAT BAG'S NOT FROM HERE!\\\"   \\\"No  it's not  but we were just in the shop and bought something.\\\"  \\\"THIS TABLE IS FOR CUSTOMERS!\\\"  \\\"Yes  we just bought a lemon bar here.\\\"  And then he looked angry and confused.  So we left. Customer service is important to me.  I would think it would be  too  to a business owner.  I don't care how good someone's food is  I'm not patronizing a shop whose owner is without manners.  And the slice of cake for $6.50 looked dry anyway.\"\n",
      "I went there with my girlfriend last week for brunch.  The food was amazing and within 15 minutes the place was packed and there was a line out the door.   Clearly this is a local favorite.  We got some hand made deserts in a to go bag for an evening meal that were amazing.   I'm a bit of coffee snob  so their french press was an especially nice compliment to our omelet and french toast.   If you are a tourist  this is a perfect place to stop for a meal after a visit to Elfreth's Alley.\n",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE! Delicious for any meal of the day  or just cheese!! Gourmet grilled cheese to die for! Eat out back in the courtyard  sooooo cute  like a little European oasis!! Yum!\n",

      "First time here the other day and on a review written by a classmate of mine I decided to check Wedge & Fig out.  The restaurant was quaint and tidy. After looking around we noticed there weren't any tables available except for one that had a reserved sign. We were greeted promptly and were surprised when the hostess made available the reserved table for us.   On to the meal...  Brunch is one of my favorite meals and I definitely wasn't left disappointed. My friend and I split a large French press coffee and it started the meal off right. We both ended up getting the same thing  which was the Eggs NOLA. Now of course when I hear cornbread in a meal I'm always skeptical of how good it'll be (I'm from GA and have had my fair share of good cornbread and biscuits lol). As for this dish  everything worked well together. The side salad with vinaigrette was just the right amount of acidity to add to the rich hollandaise sauce on this take of eggs Benedict. Overall my only complaint would be that the side potatoes looked and tasted crispy but weren't hot when the plate came out.  Looking at the total meal and ambience I couldn't give this place less than *****.   Cheers Wedge & Fig\n",

      "Yummy and from what I've heard  pretty authentic. Def a great place for dim sum and spicy food\n",
      "Spicier than Han Dynasty! But... still not spicy enough :P But I love their fried meats  and it's pretty cheap! It feels much more like the Chinese restaurants I'm used to  so it's really comfy  no pretenses. They seem to have a karaoke room as well  although I've never checked it out.  I know there's a huge debate over whether E Mei or Han Dynasty is better  and they both have loyal followings. However  it really depends on what you're looking for  they have different specialties (and you'll find that even among the different Han branches). So give them all a shot and figure out what you like best from each  so you know the best place to got to to deal with your next craving!\n",
      "Hot sour mung bean noodle was great Ma Po tofu was great Dumplings were average Generals Tsos wasn't very good. Idk why I can't find great general tsos anywere in Chinatown  The hot and sour soup had good flavor but only a tiny bit of meant and one little piece of tofu\n",
      "I was here a few years ago and was disappointed with the not so good food.   I have to say that this restaurant has completely turned around.  The food is authentic and amazing.  This food in my opinion is even better than Queens. Of course  you have to be able to eat spicy food and like the Sichuan flavor.\n",
      "I love this place. Typically order beef with long hot pepper. Plenty of spice for meal and I find myself craving it from time to time. Staff here is nice and attentive. I want to come back and try the hot pot one time  but have no idea how it works.\n",
      "Pretty sure E Mei is my fave szechuan restaurant in Phl. I've been here for hotpot  dinner  lunch  take outs - so so good. In fact  I'm writing this review because I suddenly remembered their ants-climbing-a-tree dish at 1am (glass noodles and ground pork and that all spicy yumminess) and needed to remind myself to return for that!   -Hotpot is great  stock is authentic  better than the other generic hotpot places. The portions are huge too. if you're the type of person that doesn't seriously gorge himself/herself  this will probably come out cheaper than AYCE places  and tastier from the fresher ingredients  -So many of their dishes are solid: ma yi shang shu  west lake beef soup  chongqing fried chicken  ma po tofu  twice-cooked pork belly  even the salted vegetable and duck soup  when I was craving some of those communal light soups for the table. one of the things i haven't tried is the wantons in chili oil  which IMO is one of the best indicators of a szechuan restaurant. I'm looking forward to trying it next time!   Service is good  attentive. Food is probably pricier than other Chinatown joints  but you're paying for the superior quality + service + cleanliness & spaciousness of the restaurant. Great for longer meals and conversations.\n",
      "The more menu items we try  the more I fall in love with this place. I am devastated that we're moving to Delaware County and won't be able to get take-out from here anymore.  The veggie lo mein and pork with hot green peppers have both been added to my usual order of Chongqing chicken. I'm also a HUGE fan of the pork dumplings with spicy chili oil. The chili oil comes with a ton of garlic and ginger in it  and it's just to die for.  As you can probably tell  we have leftovers for days when we eat here. We just can't resist ordering all of the delicious dishes so we end up having a lot of leftovers.  I will miss you  E Mei. I will miss you :(\n",
      "chinese chicken nuggets. braised pork belly. everything here is great. you really cant go wrong  unless you start ordering all the american chinese food like beef n broc or sesame chicken. but then again that stuff is probably delicious as well.\n",
      "I never had szechuan style cuisine in the US before and I am so glad that E Mei was my first! The food there is extremely authentic and spicy! The owner and waiters treated us like we were the only customer there when there was almost a full house!   At first I was very nervous due to the spiciness and oily of traditional szechuan style food  but I was glad the owner helped us order and give us a great balance of flavor!   We had a spicy fish dish that was BANGING! And a smoked duck dish! Holy cow was it amazing!   Definitely highly recommend checking out the place even it's in the dead part of Chinatown!\n",
      "I came here on a Monday  didn't make reservations but got seated quickly. I got the beef tendon. It was around 20 (including tip and tax). I also got a sprite. The dish itself was around 16. It was a decent sized plate  enough to feed two but I decided I could finish it myself. Super Spicy!!!!! Flavor was really good. I'd recommend coming here if you love spicy food like extra spicy!\n",
      "I like Vintage. I really do  but in a city that hosts a number of other wonderful wine bars this one has a lot of competition.  Service is solid. The bartenders are courteous and attentive. The wine list is good and the happy hour includes a decent selection PLUS $5 bubbly so you can be a baller on a budget.  Food however  is just okay. It's reliable but nothing that has me yearning to go back.   Overal this place is consistent and you've gotta like that.\n",
      "Great place for low key wine and dinner. We came during happy hour which is 4-6pm (a little early for most people) and the wine options for $4 were great. They are normally $8-12. The fig and Gorgonzola  only 3 pieces  was delicious as was the stuffed crepes with mushroom duxelle on the specials menu. Great for small groups or a date.\n",
      "The host tried to make us sit at the bar cos we were only here for drinks when they had quite a few vacant tables! But us four girls can't possibly have a good conversation at the bar! So we just plopped ourselves onto their cushy seats at the front. And we ordered food  The appetizers are very decently prized and go well with our wines. The Gorgonzola and Fig Bruschetta and the Provencial Bruschetta are very good. Bread goes so well with wine  IMO. I wouldn't try the escargots (uggghhh) but according to my friend who did (gross)  they weren't cooked well (even grosser!). And I love how the foods are sometimes served in tiered trays. That somehow always seems to push it up a notch in the class level for me. Yes even eating fries can be classy  if they are served on tiered trays- and funny enough thats exactly what happens here!  They serve a wide variety of wines and some beers and champagne. There's also the Flights ($15)  which is a wine sampler consisting of 3 wines pre-picked.  What I like about Vintage is the creativity of their interior designs. The still-expanding wine-crate-panelled wall is such a brilliant idea. very beautiful and tasteful. the wine bottle chandelier is also very interesting.  Its dim and intimate and not at all intimidating. Allows for good conversation. Great date spot. Not sure if this is typical here but a particular gentleman bought us a bottle of wine and left - without giving us a chance to thank him. Lovely.\n",
      "Was in Philly with the fam visiting the Convention center and decided to stay for dinner.  Stupid me didn't reserve (Sat) as didn't think we'd stay this late.   We dropped in a few restos via Yelp but all said they were booked or over 1 hr waiting.   Past by VWB and seeing it look nice and semi full  took a chance and asked the nice host if he can take us and we're just gonna eat and go.  He was so nice and said no problem and sat us in the back.  Our waitress Stephanie was very nice and prompt and explained the different flights they had and the specials were on the board.  DW had a Spanish flight and I opt for the bold red.  The wines were very nice 3 oz pours.  Ordered the following apps: charcutière plate and fries based on the Yelp reviews.  The plate came on a wooden board of 2 types of cold cuts with bread  homemade chicken paté and pickles.  Fries were the matchstick fries.  Both were yummy.  Next we ordered from the board specials:  Grilled quails (me)  DW (grilled fish)  also gnocchi plate  and burger and to share a grilled octopus (yes we were hungry and have been walking in the cold!).  Dishes were not huge but were perfect sized so we can have dessert afterwards.  There was about 2 whole quails mixed in a sweetish sauce and was very good.  I think the fish was the best dish overall.  Grilled perfectly and was accompanied with pineapple sauce and red cabbage salad.   The gnocchi (lightly pan fried) was tied for 2nd with the quails.  I didn't have a chance to try the huge burger since my son gobbled it up and said it was delish.  Dessert of the day was Creme bruleé  pecan pie  and french toast with banana foster/w marshmallows.  We ordered all of them and we cleaned it all up : )   I was surprised that my 3 wine flight was only $13 and my DW's 2 wine flights were $11 which is not bad considered just a glass will run you $10.  Overall  I really enjoyed this place and will go again next time a la date night if I'm heading to Philly.\n",
      "While vacationing in Philly with my family for the Army Navy game  we decided to take a walk around and stumbled upon Vintage. We walked passed it and decided to double back and stop in. We enjoyed the appetizers and wine selection. It was a nice \\chill\\\" bar where you didn't have to scream and shout to have a conversation. My mom and aunts enjoyed themselves but it wasn't necessarily a general \\\"older\\\" crowd. We went on a Thursday night and had a blast. If I lived in Philly  I'm sure I would visit again. However  when on vacation I never like to visit the same place twice. :)\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wonderful little wine bar in Philly. We stopped in for a couple of glasses of wine when several other places around had waits  or were closed. Vintage did not disappoint. Really great wine selection  nice and friendly staff (knowledgeable  too)  and an all-around fun atmosphere. The food looked great  but we were on our way to dinner  so we didn't indulge. Next time.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a very nice place!! Went here for St. Patty's Day  and sat outside. The atmosphere around the restaurant was great and the wine was amazing. We had multiple glasses of Reisling and Prosecco... they were wonderful. We had the cheese and charcuterie board... they were both delightful. The best thing about this spot was the excellent service. Though  we were sitting outside  they constantly checked on us and made us feel so welcomed. I will definitely be back!!!\n",
      "I must admit that I am not the wine and cheese sort of guy more of a beer and chips dude but this place was a nice change of pace.  We had some kind of French wine that I damn near licked out of the glass that it was so good. My wife and I sat in front of some open windows and sipped wine for what seems like all afternoon. We also had a platter of cheese and some meats that was finger licking good.  If I lived in Philly I could easily see me taking my wife here on a regular basis to just sip a little wine and enjoy our life.\n",
      "We felt very sick after brunch. I ordered the pancakes  and my friend ordered the mushroom toast. When the pancakes first came out  they were very mushy (almost runny) in the middle. The pancakes were supposed to be a little different (blue corn?)  so I asked our server if they were supposed to be like that. He said they weren't  and he took them away.   Meanwhile  the mushroom toast had arrived. We were totally unprepared. Instead of toast  someone had baked some sort of sweet brioche  cut it into a cube a little bigger than my fist  soaked it in butter  and then deep fried it. Oh  and there were some mushrooms on top. The fried butter cube came in a small cast iron skillet  which was also filled with mushroom-flavored butter. The first bite was good because butter is delicious... but we had to force the later bites. I say \\we\\\" because my pancakes didn't come back until we had finished the mushroom toast-- even though there were only six other people in there.  When the pancakes came back  they looked exactly the same. Still runny  but maybe a little burnt on the outside. We were pretty over Supper at this point  so I just ate half of them and we left.  Unfortunately  we felt SO SICK afterwards that neither of us could eat for the rest of the day. (And we hadn't eaten before brunch  so it was pretty clear what was making us sick.) That evening  I sent a nice (truly!) email to the manager explaining that brunch had made us severely nauseous  and describing what we ate-- I even took care to write it before dinner so they could check their ingredients and make sure nothing had gone bad. That was about two weeks ago  and we never even got a response!  The ambiance is wonderful  and some other people looked like they had nice food on their plates. We paid fifty bucks for 2 stomachaches and 1 ignored email.\"\n",
      "I heard about this restaurant on an episode of Andrew Zimmern's show.  It's located right across the street from Whole Foods on hipster South Street.  I really liked the restaurant's decor which included a noteworthy light fixture.  I had to try the assorted deviled egg appetizer of the day which was almost two pretty to eat!  It featured a truffle  chipotle lime  buffalo chicken  and sesame ginger egg which was clearly delicious and my favorite.  I also had the duck and waffles.  It featured a crispy duck confit leg with pecan sage waffles and cabbage.  It was a magnificent flavor combination.  The server  Carmine  was very friendly and accommodating with a sense of humor.  He joked how fun it is to watch the interesting people/characters coming and going across the street at Whole Foods.\n",
      "Supper is one of my new favorite brunch spots in Philly. I've been to Supper for dinner previously  but recently stopped by for Sunday brunch after it made Philly Mag's Restaurant Club Brunch Guide.  We went on a Sunday around 12:30pm. They were pretty booked up with reservations (they take reservations for brunch!) but we managed to score two seats at the bar. The eggs benedict was one of the best I've had and even better than the one my husband makes (which is pretty damn good). All sides are separate  so order the cornbread hush puppies if you know what's good for you and the duck fat fingerling potatoes. Yes  my friend  fried cornbread + potatoes + duck fat = heaven.  Service was good  and the freshly squeezed orange juice was delightful. Brunch at Supper is slightly more chic (ie. this ain't Honey's hipster scene) but comfortably casual nonetheless.  Final thoughts... A great place for Sunday brunch especially when you can plan ahead and make reservations. Food is fresh  well-made  and offers twists on the standard brunch staples.\n",
      "At first I was a bit overwhelmed by the lay-out of Supper's menu: hors d'oeuvres  firsts  plates  large plates...  But our server successfully demystified the menu and was able to offer detailed recommendations  which I appreciated.  She was also quite helpful when I explained that I had a dairy allergy.    Everything was delicious.  I particularly enjoyed the crab latkes and was intrigued by the deviled eggs  which had unique additives like old bay and truffles.  For my \\plate\\\" I ordered the pork tenderloin which was juicy and flavorful.  It tasted as though it had been in a slightly sweet marinade that really enhanced the flavor.  I also ordered two different cocktails  both of which were smooth and tasty.  I feel confident that I will enjoy any menu item I choose in the future.  Although I would not consider Supper appropriate for every day dining  I feel that for the quality and uniqueness of the menu and the experience  it is priced appropriately.  I would highly recommend Supper for a special occasion or date night.\"\n",
      "What a disappointment.  We were excited to come  and made reservations for our anniversary dinner. We were seated promptly  and the service was acceptable. But the food was very sub-par. I ordered the Pastrami Fried Chicken and it was 4 small pieces of chicken  that were filled with small bones  so required a lot of careful cutting to avoid eating bones. The flavor of the meat was very one-note. Overly smokey. There was a mayo based sauce on the plate that was tasty  but again  one-note. No depth or variety of flavor. The grits underneath were good. My wife got the duck and waffles. The waffle was so hard  we literally couldn't cut through it. How are you supposed to eat that? She said that the duck tasted old.   For $100+ meal  you can do much better. We won't be back.\n",
      "Enjoyed the Restaurant Week menu.  Selected the deviled eggs  sweet potato soup  skate wing  and passion fruit bar dessert.  Service was good  but not perfect.  A wrong entree was delivered to the table and our fellow diner had a couple minute wait for the proper one to be brought.  The Sorcerer cocktail was a fantastic concoction that I highly recommend.  Nice wine list  also.  I would definitely give Supper another try for the regular menu some time.\n",
      "We called on a Thursday evening around 6:45 to ask about the wait and were told we'd probably wouldn't be seated until 8.  We decided to head over anyway  figuring we could always sit at the bar.  When we arrived 15 minutes later  eight of the ten tables downstairs were empty and we sat right away.  Maybe a whole bunch of people called to cancel their reservations?? Strange  but not the end of the world.    We had the pretzels with chili & beer fondue and I wish we had ordered something else.  The cheese sauce had a weird aftertaste and the pretzels weren't particularly good. The Smoked Chicken wings had an interesting  tasty sauce.     I definitely recommend the Acorn squash and leek salad. I ordered it despite the fact that it has cranberries  and I usually don't like fruit in salads. Make sure you get a piece of everything on your fork before you take a bite  the flavors are amazing together.  I didn't try the Grilled Flatbread because i don't eat sopressata but others at the table said it was ok  but too salty to finish. The pesto  in the Strozzapreti pasta was way too strong  you couldn't taste any of the other vegetables in the dish. The Sea Scallops were cooked well and the romesco was good.  My Grilled Poundcake dessert was gross.  The pound cake itself was charred  enough that even when i took a bite with the almond ice cream and pear all i could taste was BURNT.  Despite that  it wasn't even warm--I guess it had been sitting out for a while.  Our server was attentive & knew the menu and the owner stopped by our table to say hi.  None of it was awful  but when I go to a small plate restaurant I kinda expect some awesome food.  If I were to go back  which I probably won't  the acorn squash salad is the only item i would order again.\n",
      "On the recommendation of our chatty waiter  we started the dinner off with a bottle of Sebastiani zin  which was surprisingly good.  The deviled eggs were great  the hush puppy side was forgettable.  I had the duck as my main course and it was fabulous.  Tried the salmon  which was good  but not as good as the duck.  Very friendly service... a bit pricey  but a great experience nonetheless.\n",
      "I was craving a burger and my husband recommended that we try Supper. The restaurant is beautiful  there's lots of wood work  a nice open feeling to the space (yet still intimate)  and a cool sculptural light fixture.   We started off with the charcuterie (choice of three) - boudin blanc  pork rillettes  and country ham. It came with mustard  pickles and some crispy toast and all of the meat was delicious. For our entrees  we each ordered the burger even though we were definitely tempted by some other items on the menu (hello slow cooked pork belly). The burger arrived and it was quite sizable  which is to be expected when you're paying almost $20 for a burger. The toppings were great  the meat flavor was delicious  but my only complaint is that my burger was overcooked. I requested medium rare (the only acceptable way to eat a burger) and unfortunately mine came medium well - basically no pink at all. The highlight of the plate was those ridiculously tasty duck fat fried potatoes with a trio of dipping sauces.   Also notable at Supper is the drink selection. We each had a cocktail that was perfectly made and unique. I will definitely be back to try some of the other entrees.\n",
      "Went here on a Thursday night with the $89 Living Social four course tasting deal. Place was dead at 6  but our early reservation scored us 1000 points on Open Table which was great.   We got to choose from a preset selection of four courses from the menu. It seemed limited at first  but we were able to make substitutions with no problem.   All of the food was great. The barley risotto and tamale fries were exceptional  as were the desserts (blueberry brown betty and apple pie). But the true standout was my duck and waffles  which is easily one of the best entrees I've had at a restaurant in Philly. I'd come back just for that.   And we definitely got a deal with the Living Social  saving roughy $25 off of the menu price for the items we ended up ordering.   If you've been thinking about Supper but have it a bit further down on your list (as was the case with us)  don't let it stay there. This place should definitely be one of your next stops. Would give it 4.5 if I could.\n",
      "Ok I know my review is going to go against the grain. But having lived in a place where latin food (Cuban  Colombian  Peruvian  Venezuelan  etc) is the staple  Tierra Colombian comes up short in so many ways.  They offer Colombian and Cuban cuisine. It may well be the \\best Colombian and Cuban food you will find in Philadelphia \\\" but that doesn't mean it is good.  The beef dishes were tough and tasteless. The fish was overcooked and dry. The Churrasco...PLEASE! And worst of all  the pork had no flavor at all!   In Miami this place would be a definite pass it by. Although the desserts were fairly good across the board. Try nearby El Balconcito  or Sazon on Spring Garden  for latin food done better. But I'm still in search of good Cuban in Philly. Forward any suggestions.  I haven't been to the nightclub portion of this place  but if the crowd is right I've no doubt the place can be a blast! And yes  the neighborhood is a bit dodgy-but don't let that be the reason you don't go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Be ready to wait a little over 10 - 15 minutes to just get your first drink. Poor attention. Food was ok butvreally  the lack of service made it ackward. Also  be ready to be charged 15% gratuity  even if it is only 2 of you.\n",
      "If it's just two of you it's best to eat at the bar.  Our service was slow and extremely amateur.  Because it was late when we arrived (well late for us -- around 9:30 and we were starving) I ordered drinks and the meal when the server arrived.   The water and bread and menus arrived immediately but the appearance of the server was delayed 10 to 15 minutes.  Not a good start.   Then my biggest fear materialized when the drinks never showed up and are food arrived first (in about 15 minutes).  The bar was beyond (two basic margaritas) but 15 minutes?   The food is also extremely \\heavy\\\" and after about 1 4 of the way through it I took the food home (it was oddly good the next day so plan on having enough for 2 or 3 meals afterwards if that's your thing).  Overall I would suggest stopping in for a drink and a snack at the bar unless you're part  of a big party where you're probably get better service.\"\n",
      "My first Colombian dinning experience was slightly disappointing.  It's so tough to judge food you're so unfamiliar with. Therefore  my rating is solely based on my initial impression on the quality of the food.  I ordered the Masa de cerdo (cubes of pork with cassava  Cuban tamale  plantains and black rice). The plantains were tasty. Tamale was plain tasting to me. Rice was okay. The pork were very dry and non-tender to say the least.  Appetizers: Shrimp empanada was good but didn't blow me away.   Drinks: Passion fruit mojito was delicious. Margarita was just okay but very generous size.  Overall  very interesting place in a very sketchy neighborhood. Watch out where you park your car. You might not see it again if you're not careful.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have only ever been here for breakfast  but it's my favorite breakfast spot in Philadelphia.  I like to get gallo pinto  which is sometimes on the menu and sometimes not  but they bring it if I ask for it: rice  black beans  sweet fried plantains  avocado  fried cheese  and steak.  And coffee.  That costs around ten dollars.  Sometimes I get arepas which are corn cakes with cheese.  By the way  the same people operate the expensive restaurant Mixto on Pine Street.  If you like Mixto  you will like Tierra Colombiana.   The menu is the same.  The food is the same.  The prices are half.  Arepas at Mixto  $2.50 for two.  Arepas at Tierra Colombiana  $0.50 each.  They are the same arepas.  They have a full bar.  Sort of.  I made the mistake of ordering bourbon.  There was a long conversation over by the bar while they tried to figure out what it was.  Eventually the waitress came back.  She was very polite.  \\Sorry  we don't have bourbon.\\\"  I realized my dumb mistake.  This is a Cuban-Colombian restaurant  of course they do not have bourbon.  Duh.  I ordered brandy instead.  If you speak English  it is possible that you will be the only customer there speaking English.  Remember to smile and say \\\"gracias\\\".  Addendum 20091005: Brought the five-year-old here for breakfast on Friday   She was very excited to be going to Daddy's secret breakfast place.  Got gallo pinto again  this time with steak.  The kid also ordered bacon  which turned out to be some of the best bacon I've ever had: thin  perfectly crisp  salty and flavorful.  And we got arepas (cheesy polenta cakes)  which I love.  But I'm really writing in because I had Cafe Cubano for the first time.  This is espresso infused with a lot of cream and brown sugar.  Wow.  Heavenly.  Suddenly I'm a Cubano addict.  Gallo pinto  plus dos arepas  bacon  cafe Cubano  cafe con leche  and hot chocolate all totalled about $21.  Then we took home half the food and ate it later.\"\n",
      "delicious! so glad a coworker shared this place with me. i can't wait to bring more friends here and get the center city dwellers to get over the shock of going north of Girard  )  excellent sweet plantains and black beans. tried the mango margarita (too salty for me)  and the red sangria (much better  sweet and filled with cut up fruit).\n",
      "One of my favorite restaurants in the Philadelphia area! I always come for the pernil and the maduros.  Unfortunately I moved further away so when I get to go it is a treat! Great portion sizes  friendly staff  and awesome food!  If you get a chance  go go go.\n",

      "My wonderful staff gave me a nice gift certificate to Matyson's  so off to dinner we went this past Monday.  My lovely date and I decided to order the tasting menu (a tribute to the recently departed Charlie Trotter.). The first two courses  mussels with sweet & sour cucumber and the Kampachi in green tomato water were excellent. The third course of lamb with baby spinach  sun chokes and truffles was sublime  and was the one of the best lamb dishes I've ever eaten.  The duck and cornbread that following were also very good  but paled in comparison to that lamb.  Matyson's is now going to be on my restaurant rotation  and the tasting menu (served Mon-Thur) is a defiant go to.  Remember to bring a nice white/rose and red to this BYOB  you won't be disappointed.\n",
      "Lovely interior with very friendly and prompt service. Don't forget to BYOB!  Must haves: -Duck ragout cavatelli. Amazing. Wish I oredered 2 and had it as an entree! -Grilled octopus app-melt-in-your-mouth. No chewy nonsense! -Beef cheeks: amazingly tender  I (literally) ate it with a spoon (so I could scoop up the sauce!)  Alright: -Halibut was good but not especially memorable  The desserts were solid. Not so good that I  would come back just for them  but both the plates for the semifredo and orange creme brûlée were both licked clean.   Overall a great experience and would return!\n",
      "Divine Matyson I still think of their perfect duck with berry sauce  Nice place  great service Scrumptious from start to finish Dinner was heaven...\n",
      "I was a little fearful of being suckered into a pricey prix fixed menu on valentine's day  but was thrilled to see that they had their normal menu with some fantastic specials. For starters we had the sweetbreads with a perfectly poached egg on top- delicious. The egg was cooked perfectly (not an easy feat) and complimented the saltiness of the sweetbreads. Plus it was entertaining to keep my husband guessing as to what sweetbreads were. For dinner I ordered the whole branzino. Super impressive the way the fish was deboned. I was expecting to choke on a bone at any moment  but the entire thing was served intact and deboned. Oh it was super super good! For dessert we had a hazelnut crepe  which was just amazing. We both greedily inhaled the dessert and wished for more. Great restaurant if you're looking for a byob without the cramped byob feel.\n",
      "We went to Matyson with some friends from Florida. Usually we always order the tasting menu which offers a great value. The quality of food is always consistent the courses inspiring. I would rate their menu at four stars. However the week we went it the menu was root vegetables and we were not inspired so we ordered from the a la carte. The experience was outstanding from the Seared Foie Gras to the Long Island Duck which was cooked to perfection.  In the future I may simply order from the a la carte. The service was four stars and pleasant. Great job chef!\n",
      "It's not often that I go out to a fancy pants BYO.  Up until last week  you could say that I'd never been to one.  Usually  you'll find me in a dimly lit bar with craft beer in my glass and something greasy on my plate.  Some nights you'll even find me in a dimly lit bar with a can of Schmidt  a shot of Beam and Chef Boyardee in my beard.  That's pretty much the variation I'm dealing with in my day-to-day.  Well I made an exception because there's a certain little lady who deserves it and I ended up picking Matyson.  Mostly because a buddy who's down in Baltimore had a $25/50 gift certificate that was due to expire before he'd be able to redeem it.  Partly because I've heard nothing but good things from people I trust on issues such as these.  But after two bites of the first course  that wouldn't have mattered anymore.  Because my mouth was telling me something:   \\Best food that's ever been in here  ever!\\\"  Having been recommended to do the tasting menu  we checked it out and she picked out 3 bottles to compliment the courses.  She selected Panil Barriquée  an Italian sour  Stillwater's Cellar Door saison and Southern Tier Pumking for/to pair with the Pumpkin Roulade dessert.  But this review isn't about the beer  so let's talk about the food.   This week's tasting menu featured a variety of local squash.    The first course was a Butternut \\\"Cappucino\\\" with White Chocolate  Lobster and a Butternut Popover (which was handy for soaking up whatever couldn't be grabbed by the spoon).  The sweet combination of the butternut lobster and chocolate coupled with the rich frothy texture was just amazing  and the sourness of the Panil provided contrast.    But this was just to get your appetite sufficiently whetted for the second course consisting of acorn squash ravioli with pistachio  pear and shaved foie gras.  Our server commented that this was her favorite dish on the tasting menu.  While I didn't agree personally (I'm not big on either pear or pistachio) it was delicious nonetheless.   Course three was up and so was a switch to the Stillwater saison.  Again she nailed it on the pairing  the spicy  earthy flavors of the saison blending with Red Snapper in a Kobocha Squash sauce with Thai Basil  peanut sambal and a couple of the most buttery smooth mussels I've ever eaten (I've eaten a lot of mussels).  The fish was over-cooked a smidgen but it really didn't matter.  I think this was my favorite of the bunch and I think it had to do with those mussels.    Next  we had Coffee Rubbed Duck Breast with Red Curi Squash Tamale  Mango and Salsa Verde.  We were glad we both saved a little bit of the Panil because it made the Duck Breast really sing.  The Duck was cooked perfectly as was the Tamale and the coolness of the fresh Mango and tanginess of the Salsa Verde just tied it all together.    And now  the moment we've all been waiting for.  The Pumpkin Roulade was fucking awesome.  That's all I'm going to say about it.  We finished with a double of Illy Espresso and a quick trip to the Lily-scented (now with real Lilies!) water closet.    Our waitress Tracy and staff were all great  everyone contributing their thoughts and seemed genuinely interested in ours.    The atmosphere was warm and comfortable.  It might be a little noisy for the bourgeois types but considering my normal haunts of choice didn't bother me a bit.  A clean shirt and a decent pair of jeans fits in nicely here.  So there it is.  My introduction into the fancy pants  BYO set.  I think I could get used to this.\"\n",
      "Matyson puts together amazing meals. The dishes are creative and complex with many flavors layered together to create remarkable results. Lately  I've been feeling \\nice-restaurant fatigue\\\" where nothing impresses me any more. So often  I leave an expensive restaurant and think  \\\"I could make that at home\\\". But I could never recreate the dishes at Matyson. From appetizer to dessert  I want to lick the plates.  And of course  everything else is great. The servers are warm and friendly. The restaurant is dimly lit at night and it is BYOB  so very romantic. The tables are a tad bit close together  however.   Forget Garces  Starr and Morimoto  this is the best spot in the city.\"\n",
      "Best scallops I've ever had in my life.  Even better than Chloe's  and those are pretty damn good!  They combine interesting ingredients to create unique flavorful dishes.\n",
      "Fantastic meal  great service.  Halibut was best fish dish we've had in Philly.\n",
      "A small neighborhood gem. I would have never have heard of this place if one of my coworkers had never told me. This BYOB is incredibly intimate AND th food is delicious.   My husband and I took my mother in law and she loved it. She loves fresh seafood and this place had it. My scallops were cooked perfectly and her fish was as well. My husband got some type of steak with small blue cheese fried tater tot things that was oh so yummy. I could probably eat a bucket of them :)  I would like to go back the next time we decide to treat ourselves!\n",
      "Excellent  fun & yummy!  If you go at night check out the special swirling light logo at the bottom of steos at the entrance.\n",
      "Service was amazing and I really enjoyed the crepe. Came here after lunch and I actually should have come before bc I definitely overdid it on my stomach. Lol.   I originally ordered the matcha chocolate truffle but read closer to the menu and decided to change it if they haven't made it yet. I really wanted ice cream. They were more than happy to obliged and only charged me the difference. I ended up going with the matcha azuki bean. It was really good  but I felt they were a lil bit heavy on the creme. I think I should have stuck with my original choice because the ice cream on top of cream made it feel heavy. But  I did really enjoy the toppings and crepe. The crepe was crispy yet soft and has a great flavor.  I'm definitely craving some now. Are they open at 730am?? Lol\n",
      "Some of the best dessert I've had in ages! I had the Caramel Fuji Apple sweet crepe and I'd drive from West Chester to Chinatown in Philadelphia just to get another one. I'd passed by this beautiful store quite a few times and I'm glad we finally stopped in.   They have a repeat customer in us.\n",
      "QUICK POINTERS * Free WiFi * Cash Only * Considerable menu [1] * Comparable to Eight Turn Crepes (New York) [2]  FOOD (experience) * Chocolate Nut Party [3] [4]  OVERALL T-Swirl Crepe makes for an awesome rest stop in the city! If you're not feeling all too hungry  order a smoothie. If you're feeling content  order a berry crepe  If you're feeling a little grumble coming up anytime soon  order a savory rib crepe. Point is  there is something for everyone in the group. Decent amount of seating  front and back rooms. Pricing is reasonable and affordable (nothing over $10 unless you're including additional filling) for a small bite that is a little more satisfying than a smoothie drink.  1-star for a satisfying crepe  1-star for atmosphere  1-star for location  1-star for food overall (menu + pricing)  and 1-star for cool service (they offer games for groups or kids to play with while waiting). They satisfy a lot of the criteria for a perfect snack stop. Service could be better  but pretty typical in the China Town area. Definitely worth checking out.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  [1] Selection of smoothie drinks  and crepes  reasonable pricing compared to a lot of other Japanese crepe joints  [2] PROS: more space  cheaper pricing (Chocolate Nut Party Price @ E.T.C. = $9.50 and @ T.S.C. = $7.50)  and free wifi // CONS: Slightly less fresh  [3] Almond  crushed pistachio  chocolate ice cream (gelato)  chocolate truffles  chocolate sauce  whipped yogurt  chocolate custard cream  chocolate pearl  and chocolate Pocky  [4] Perfect satisfaction for chocolate lovers! My ice cream scoop may look a bit smaller than what it initially was when they handed the crepe to me because of the time I spent trying to get a decent picture showcasing it's beauty  working with one hand to capture it without my other hand being awkwardly angled. Nice amount of each filling  Any more and you probably won't be a chocolate lover much more by the time you finish it ha.\n",
      "THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD. I AM SCREAMING AS I WRITE THIS REVIEW.  I always get the caramel fuji apple crepe and it makes me believe in God even though I'm an atheist.\n",
      "I don't get it. The mixture of flavors and the crispy texture of the sweet crepe weren't what I think makes good crepe. And you can't build your own crepe. To each their own. but it sucks you can't build your own crepe cause sometimes people don't like the flavor combos that are provided. Couldn't finish it after the cream cheese overpowered everything and there's not even that much ingredient inside the crepe. Might as well make shitty crepes at home  same thang.\n",
      "Very good quality crepes but the price too me is too high  and the layout of the restaurant is odd. This is like too big to be a snack too small to be a meal ugh.\n",
      "OMG you must must MUST get the Matcha Azuki Bean sweet Crêpe!!!! Truly a life changing experience. The Crêpe is just the right amount of crispy and it's GLUTEN-FREE (can you even believe it???). Flavor is rich and creamy  and I topped it all off with a scoop of green tea ice cream. An explosion of flavors with the red beans too. Can't wait to get my next one\n",
      "I love going here  they make the most prettiest crepes! If you are scared of trying out rice crepes  dont! It doesn't taste any different  i love the crispy texture it gives!\n",
      "\n",
      "My family was visiting Philly and was looking for a place for everyone to get something they wanted. This was the place!  Service was out of this world - waitress was warm and funny  and kept our water glasses filled.  Food came out hot!  Kids meals were huge  and our omelettes were as well. Perhaps cooked  a little too much in butter because they were a bit greasy. Overall  a good meal.\n",
      "As a life-long Philly resident  I've eaten in pretty much every diner in town and this one has to be the absolute worst.  The waitress was dippy and clueless.  It wasn't crowded (no wait to be seated) but it took 20 minutes for Sharon to take our order.  She brought our sodas right away but it was half an hour before our food arrived and it was horrible.  The only thing that arrived quickly was the check.  Two adults and two kids for lunch and the check was $60 before the tip!  Both boys ages 7 and 8 ordered from the kids menu which was way overpriced ($7 for a overcooked  dried-up (he ordered it medium) hamburger the size of a minute and soggy steak fries. Oh  and he ordered cheese on that burger and the slice of fake orange cheese cost an extra $2!  While we were waiting paitently for our food  we saw a constant stream of plates being returned by other servers to the kitchen and brought back at other tables near us--not a good sign.  I had the turkey club sandwich for $13 with very little shredded lunch meat turkey and several slices of cold  thick  undercooked  fatty bacon.  It did have lots of garbage on it to make it look like a big  thick sandwich--a ton or shreded lettuce  two unripe tomatos  avocado slices and literally a pinch of sprouts.  Of course  since it took so long to get our food the two slices of toasted bread were cold and soggy.  It came with the same crappy steak fries--clearly frozen  not fresh cut.  It's pretty hard to make a bad turkey club sandwich  but they did.  The last turkey club I had was a few months ago at McGillin's and it was a triple decker with plenty of fresh sliced roasted turkey and warm  cooked  bacon for like $9.  With the prices they charge at Darling's  the only repeat business I see them getting will be people with no taste buds who don't mind overpaying for crappy food and terrible service.\n",
      "Darling's is really cute and the outdoor seating option is great. However  the food was pretty unremarkable. Their marketing is charming and their location is great. Nonetheless  for Sunday brunch  it was nothing to write home about. I don't live or work close enough for it to be convenient for me  so I probably won't go back anytime soon.\n",
      "Wow! people are so hard on this place! It's not that bad. If you gotta go to Darlings and you're not having breakfast or their most perfect key lime pie  try the ahi tuna appetizer or even a wrap paired with the very fresh spring mix salad. Plus it's the best 24 hr spot in the no libs area.\n",
      "I must say   I am rather surprised at how many Yelpers tore down this place for service and food   I had quite the opposite experience.  I went here with dear friends who have only had positive experiences.  I admit   I was skeptical   given the reviews I read.  I am glad I trusted my friends' experience.  2 of us had dishes with ahi tuna (me - greek salad with the tuna as add-on) and it was a really decent salad.  Was it the very best I ever had ?  No.  AND  it was a totally pleasurable experience.   The espresso ... smooth and silky and totally hit the mark being the coffee snob that I am !  And   what is totally consistent with other Yelpers is the cheesecake.  The very best I have ever had.  Got the classic.  Perfect blend of fluffy and custardy and not too heavy.  What helped me make this choice was another server standing near the dessert case who very skillfully spoke about the differences in the types of cheesecakes -- which was beyond helpful in making my choice.  Our primary server was very attentive.  I would totally come back.\n",
      "Disappointing.   This should be a home run - a retro-hipster diner in the Piazza  but we were underwhelmed. My wife's turkey burger was not good  down to the mealy tomatoes  and my short ribs were a little fatty and were not as flavorful as I'd hoped. Our waitress made minor errors with both our meals  but was otherwise attentive. Pricing was a little high  but that was to be expected  given the locale.   All in all  I wanted this to be a great diner  and it doesn't come close. If I had to  I'd come back  but I don't think I'd choose to.\n",
      "Wish I had read some reviews before I went........ Went around 6:30 on Thursday night. There were 8 of us  4 adults and 4 children. 3 of the children are on the Autism spectrum  but they're actually teenagers  freshmen in high school. The kids ordered first. After getting our beverages  we ordered. Nothing crazy  just burgers and sandwiches. The diner was basically empty and wow  it took forever to get our food! The kids food came first  probably 25 mins after ordering. Our food literally 20 mins later. One of the other moms stated that having been there a few times before  thought that the staff might include a few \\stoners\\\" which would definitely explain the wait. All in all  pricey and really not worth the wait. Not really a reason to go back when there are so many options in the area:-(!\"\n",
      "A nice diner with decent prices. I went there expecting to pay a little higher for food because it was new and in a up and coming area  but was very surprised with the bill. The burgers are amazing. Cooked to order  they are lightly seasoned and topped with fresh veggies. Safe to say one of the better burgers I have had in a while. My only complaint is the menu isn't very big. There is not a whole lot to choose from  but the food that is on the menu is very good.\n",
      "Always a favorite. Love their breakfast  they have something called the very adult hot chocolate. Really good especially on those cold winter days.\n",
      "I have to say this was one the worst dinning experiences I have ever had. I eat out at a lot of places and enjoy recommending new places to eat to friends and such  but I could never recommend that anyone ever eat here. I'm really displeased. Their soft opening was great  the $6 cheeseburgers were awesome. Sadly  the cheeseburger is now $11.  Examples  - No free refills on your $1.75 soda - Meals came out at different times. Two people received their food at least five minutes before me and when mine arrived it was cold. - Waiter stood there and watched me fill in the tip and sign the check. - Food is extremely expensive. $70 for 4 people. - Food was pretty mediocre. My open-faced brisket dinner was without bread and tasted like roast beef at best. Worth maybe $9  not $18!  If anyone can find an email address for Darling's I'd like to send them a letter.\n",

      "Had a little issue wit communication the second time ordering but was very happy with managements handling and assurance of the situation  quick delivery very affordable pricing and quality sushi will be my go to place from now on\n",
      "Three and half stars! Would order from here again. Placed the order at 7:40 and it was biked over at 8:15. Fab. Especially since I live like a 15 minute bike ride away.   Sweet potato roll and shrimp tempura roll and yellowtail roll were all delish.\n",
      "I ordered takeout from here. I had a baby lobster roll  spicy tuna roll  and some nigiris. The price and portion was reasonable. The reason I rated this place 2 stars is because there were scales in my spicy tuna roll....umh... Why???? My first piece i felt something hard and i automatically knew it was scales so i spat it out. I tried 2 more pieces there were scales in there too. By now I'm m convinced the other pieces had scales too. Of course i didnt eat the rest of the rolls.  I dont know if the whole meal was unsatisfying or maybe the scales in the spicy tuna roll just turned me off. Dont know if I'll return but if i do i hopefully next time the chef will thouroughly clean the fish and leave out the scales.\n",

      "Of the dim sum places I've been to in Philly  this is my favorite. They offer a wide variety of items to choose from and it's all extremely tasty. My favorite cart  of course  is always the buns and the sesame balls.   The staff was extremely friendly and helpful too. They did look at my friend funny when she was trying to describe the one item she was looking for  but they made sure to bring it out to us when another plate of meatballs came out.   Fabulous all around.\n",
      "Joy Tsin Lau is your typical Chinese restaurant located right in the heart of Chinatown. They have a large space with many tables. They have an upstairs (usually held for banquets) and downstairs for regular patrons. They have a large menu with your typical (known) Chinese food like walnut shrimp  fried rice  noodles etc. They also have the not so typical Chinese food like fresh water shrimp (my favorite)  fish maw soup or a fresh water eel dish. This is a good place to go to if you just want Chinese food or if you are feeling adventurous to try different dishes.\n",
      "this is my top restaurant in chinatown! the food and service are amazing! we been eating at Joy Tsin Lau for long time  and each time we have a great time and love their food  we love their lobster salad and cold cut appetizers  the lamb hot pot with scallions was the best  and the seafood in nest was so good   the dry scallops and OX sauce fried rice tasted so good as well. we definitely will come back soon.\n",
      "Dim sum on carts! I really like Joy Tsin Lau - it's really fast  decent dim sum for a really low price - I am always surprised at how little my meal ends up costing here. They have a huge variety of dim sum dishes  and they're super eager to help get you what you want if you don't happen to see it on a cart. The food itself is pretty good  although the congee could use some improvement. Overall  a great place for casual dim sum!\n",
      "My first experience with Dim Sum was in this place and I love it.  There were so many things to choose from.  I love the shrimp dish  there is a picture of it in the picture section.  The beef meat balls were good too. The fragrance from  jasmine tea that they serve is  very relaxing and a perfect addition to their food.  I wanted to crawl in the sesame balls and sleep in it.   Anyway  bottom line is that the food is good  the service is good and the decoration is really red.  If you have a question I suggest talking to one of the waiters instead of the ladies that push the cart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Today was my first dim sum experience ever and I loved it... There's always a long line to get in but i usually moves fast so it should be about 10 to 15 min max... I loved the steamed pork ribs and the fried dumplings... The also have fried salt and pepper shrimp which is absolutely delicious and very recommendable... The service honestly is really bad but I'm ok with that as long as the quality of the food is good (so don't expect rock star treatment but really good quality food)... At the end dim sum for two (incluiding 6 different appetizers and 2 sodas) was only 20 bucks... cant beat that!!\n",
      "We went to Joy Tsin Lau for the first time today for dim sum. I have been an Ocean Harbor regular for about two years  but I think almost everything is better at Joy Tsin Lau  with the notable exception of the rice congee.  As one would expect  we ordered many dim sum dishes  however  I will just hit the highlights. The turnip cakes were really great and with a larger portion size than is typical  something I definitely appreciate. The zongzi  leaf-wrapped steamed rice  we found wonderfully dark after being steamed in the leaves for so long  and they were filled with incredibly tender and fatty meat. These were my favorite. I also thought the shumai were very well done. The cheung fan were so delicious my partner could not stop eating them!  One complaint is that we didn't see any green vegetables roll around until we were nearly done eating  although everything else was plentiful. I usually like a smoky green veggie with my dim sum  but we missed out today. The congee was good  but as I mentioned  I think Ocean Harbor's is better.  We arrived around 11:00am which was just in time to beat the line. We were literally eating within two minutes of walking in the front door. The price of a pot of tea  5 small dishes and 2 large dishes was $25 including tip. Not bad!\n",
      "First visit after their expansion...  It was a busy night  about 20 minutes for a table but found seats at the bar.  They had a good selection of beer.    The lighting of the place was brighter than expected.  They have multiple unisex bathrooms in the back of the restaurant. (I miss the old bathrooms tho).  The food was alright.    Its a place to come for the atmosphere with good friends to have a good time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent venue with good food.  The restaurant is clean  well laid out  and spacious with a large number of televisions  perfect for watching a game.  Extremely accommodating staff!\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoy Misconduct every time I go  they have great specialty drink options and a diverse menu with something for everyone.  I eat fairly healthy  but they give me a reason to splurge on their delicious Avocado French Fries! The servers are great  attentive and knowledgeable.  Their outdoor seating is another perk  just not an ideal location for people watching.  All in all  this is a great place to have dinner and pre-game before a night out.\n",
      "Good place to catch a drink in the city.  Great beer selection (hello craft beer!)  and their cocktails are a good concoction.  This was my first time here since they expanded the space  so everything looks new  bright and clean!  And they have tons of TVs  and not all broadcasting the same thing. Staff was very attentive  and the happy hour drink specials featured beer  wine and cocktails!  Definitely good if your group all have a different drink preference.  I had the fries and chicken fingers.  Both were good  the fingers were very crispy.  Seems like Mac and Cheese is their speciality  so I'll give a variation of it a try next time!\n",
      "\n",
      "Was lucky to get a table for 4 to watch the playoff game.  Good place to watch games with many large TVs placed so that everyone can watch from different angles.  Started out with prompt service but that declined as the night went on.  The place got mobbed and our server had trouble covering her section along with pushing through the crowd.  It got very loud as the night went on.    Beer and drink selection was nice.  We were not super hungry and I split a couple of apps with my wife.  Fried pickles and cheesesteak empanadas.  Pickles were ok - they were thick cut. Cheesesteak empanadas were missing the cheese and steak....  Cut the 2 empanadas in half and there was literally almost nothing inside.    Other couple we were with had wings and said they were good.\n",
      "Misconduct is a great center city happy hour spot.  The food is awesome and their specials never disappoint.  Their happy hour is half off SELECT drafts.  On the draft list  you can tell which ones are on special by the (HH) next to them.  I've noticed over the last few months that less and less of the draft list are half off at happy hour....which does sadden me.  The mac n cheese is always delicious!  Be careful though  it can get pricey the more stuff you add to it.  All in all  the atmosphere is nice.  The food is good.  And the drink specials are okay.\n",
      "Decent service but the food was highly disappointing. We ordered the dry rub wings  avocado fries  gravy fries  and tuna sliders. The wings were the only thing we liked. The avocado fries were too breaded and the aioli was basically mayo. The gravy fries sauce was terrible and just overall not great. The tuna sliders  which we were looking most forward to were comprised of cooked chunks of tuna  not at all what we were expecting. If you come here just stick to beer  they are trying too hard to make simple bar food fancy and are not succeeding.\n",
      "The first time was brunch and it was a sampling of dishes including their charcuterie and smoked fish  the service was attentive  and overall a place I would try a second time without hesitation. However  the second time was for dinner and we didn't finish any one of the three dishes we ordered. Aside from our server  who was again wonderful  the kitchen was definitely NOT on its A-game. The presentation of the plates bordering on sloppy was not what I had experienced the first time and every dish salted to an extreme. Because the difference was so vast  I am guessing that the latter was atypical and perhaps in future  I will go back to see.\n",
      "I've never had an overwhelming desire to try Scandinavian food but I just couldn't ignore all the hype about Noord!  To start we got the Bitterballen which were amazing.  They were more croquette-like than meatball-like...not what I was expecting (in a really good way!). They were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Next were the Holland Sliders.  I have to say  I was not a fan of these.  I think herring may be an acquired taste (one which I don't think I'll be acquiring any time soon).  For my entree I went with the trout and my friend went with the salmon.  Both were delicious but I preferred the salmon.  I loved that both entrees were swimming in a super tasty broth (each broth being different to complement their respective fish). We topped off our meal with a shared slice of almond butter cake.  Holy shit  be sure to save room for this if you dine here!  The chef himself came out to tell us about the specials and pour our beers.  Service was attentive but relaxed & friendly.\n",
      "I'm really disappointed in my recent dining experience here because I went in with high expectations. I would say I'm very easy on wait staff  but the service here was indifferent and seemed annoyed to have to do their jobs. Our waitress came to our table and barely said anything or looked at us. We waited almost an hour before our food came out and she never checked on us. It wasn't worth the wait. The food was bland and overcooked. The best parts of the restaurant are the view you get of the square and that it's a byob. So I would definitely skip Noord and go to one of the many great restaurants in the neighborhood.\n",
      "I have parties 4 times a year  a \\themed\\\" dinner party.  For summer this year I decided to have a \\\"midsummer\\\" party and serve Scandinavian food.  After pouring through my boyfriend's large collection of Scandinavian cook books I came to realize that in general the food sucked.  There are limited ingredients and really  how much salmon and lingonberry can one eat?  So  we headed to Noord to get some inspiration.  I wasn't too optimistic and was not looking forward to wasting a meal in the city on Scandinavian food.  To say I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement.  We went for Sunday brunch  I had the best omelette of my life  mushroom and smoked gouda.  I would love to know how they made it so fluffy.  Crispy fried potatoes with a sour cream mustard sauce.  My boyfriend had the open face plate  with three different smoked items atop toast.  I don't remember all three  but I poached a piece of smoked scallop off his plate and was then upset I didn't get one myself.  Atmosphere was nice  BYOB which saves on the bill  which in itself was quite reasonable.  We are definitely going back for dinner soon.\"\n",
      "Food here is top notch! This was my first time trying Scandinavian food  I ordered Hete Kip Uitsmijter and it was delicious. Eating an open faced sandwich was new to me too  it wasn't too spicy for me. The place was small and busy on a Saturday brunch  finding close street parking was probably the most difficult part.\n",
      "A lovely room.  Attentive service. A weird menu that feels more like lunch than dinner.  The portions were generous.  The presentation attractive.  But everything was over spiced and oily.  Really marginal food.  Not recommended.  Plus  you might think the restaurant is Scandic.  Not so.  It's Dutch and Indonesian inspired.  No reason to return.\n",
      "This was the perfect place to celebrate a special occasion. The ambiance is lovely  candlelit  warm  and friendly. The food is exquisite. Our entrees were delicious  but that's not all. They were also nutritious and well balanced meals.   There was also a really cute photo exhibition in the restrooms.\n",
      "Great service. Everyone was really welcoming and checked in often.  Food was creative. Lots of pickling. Favorites were the smoked salmon appetizer and the rabbit. Restaurant is small but has large open windows so it's not too loud and you get a good view of the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ate at Noord within weeks of opening  but just recently started \\yelping\\\". This place was too fun  the staff looked like such a fun group of people I wanted to be one of them! The food was delicious  the bread was amazing  as well as the lamb burger. Yum I could rave all day  Can't wait to go back but might wait till next spring so it gets warmer again! Unless I can make it there before its too cold. We'll see  good job Noord!!!!!!!!\"\n",
      "The shame of it is  prior to their takeover by Urban Outfitters  this was one of the best places in the area. The food was amazing  drinks great  awesome atmosphere. Still a good drink place  but the food is horrible.   As many have said on here  the wings are so-so. I've ordered them a few times and each time have gotten them in different states. None amazing  some average  and some underdone.   The Mac and cheese was so-so and had fallen into the vain of way to many other ingredients than just mac and cheese.   One of their amazing stapes used to be their honey glazed fried chicken. In the take over that was taken off the menu. Recently  fried chicken was added back on  but it was dry  not good  and something I'll steer clear from.  And the pasta  don't  just don't.   As a place to go out to start the night for drinks. Perfect (thus the three stars). To hang out at  play pool  or just chill  it's still a good vibe to hang out at. But to go for dinner  way too many better options a stones throw away.  Originally I thought I was being overly critical when the change over happened because they changed the menu completely and even changed the format of the menu to something that was horribly confusing and tough to read. A few months later  they changed the menu back to the original format  and changed it up a tad bit. I get them going away from the high end gastropub vibe under the Vetri brand  but  even if you want to go in a different direction  see the quality of what your competitors are bringing to the table. Other gastropubs that don't have the amazing space you offer  the potential you bring. When the food was better  you couldn't keep me out of there  now  I try the food a few months hoping to get a semblance of what you brought to the table before. It's a great place with great potential still. Just get the food back to where it was. Please....\n",
      "We were a party of ten  which in my experience can mean the service is disjointed  not at Alla Spina  the service was excellent. Advise about ordering was very good and we were happy with the variety of small plates and entrees. The noise was a bit much  especially as it was self inflicted with music. We look forward to returning.\n",
      "as with Osteria it didn't really work for me...Noisy room -OK  it's a brew pub-with strange unappealing menu.Don't come here unless you really love meat.Everything I tried was over-salted...did I mention that a casual dinner for four ran well over $200-?\n",
      "I have been here a few times for just drinks.  Bartenders are always very friendly.  I recently attended the New Years Eve party.  They did a wonderful job.  It was a great crowd of people.  The food was amazing!  Everything was well hosted and organized.  I loved that Marc Vetri was there as well.  Best of all  right before midnight  I said to my friends  \\It would be awesome if they brought out pizza right after midnight.\\\"  AND THEY DID!!  Happy new year to me!!  Thank you for a wonderful experience.  Happy 2016!!\"\n",
      "I really liked the atmosphere at Alla Spina but we might have been here on an off night and found the food to be a bit too salty.  The soft serve ice cream was delicious. I'd try it again but would prefer return trips to Amis.\n",
      "Like the concept  like that it's filling North Broad with some life  like the food  and like the place.  I came in for a quick two beers and sandwich after being on the road for a bit  so was pretty tired and not in full review mode.  But everything seemed great  for just having opened.  Not the fairest of review  as I was still recovering from a head cold  so I couldn't taste all that much.  I'm not a mayonnaise fan  so if you aren't either  I'd tell them to hold the mayo on the veal Milanese hoagie.  Other than that  all decent stuff!  I'll definitely be back to give a more thorough review.\n",
      "The food here is delicious  and the decor is great. The craft beer selection is enough to please my boyfriend who is a definite beer snob and I enjoy the cocktails very much. The issues I have are portion size and pricing. The prices are outrageous considering how little food you get. To really fill up  you need to order at least two entrees per person  but the tiny little \\entrees\\\" are the price of what would be a full portion at other restaurants. We walked out having paid over $70 for dinner for two and were still hungry when we got home (granted  we each had one drink). I don't think I'll be back unless it is for happy hour.\"\n",
      "I've been waiting for the right moment to visit this place and it finally happened. What a GREAT spot! The menu is a welcome change for the whole \\small plate\\\" movement that's sweeping Philly. Favorites were- The Beer Cheese toast with Fried Egg & Bacon  Cucumber/Pepporcino salad  and the Potin (sp?) with Guinea Hen Ragu was freaking AMAZING!!! Was let down by the Veal Breast Milanese hoagie  it seemed to have been WANTING to be a really good Chicken Cutlet hoagie  but it was just wasn't happening. (Nothing beats a KILLER chicken cutlet). The Mortadella hot was surrounded by a claim of \\\"It will be the BEST HOT DOG YOU EVER ATE\\\" - sorry  but it's not. While the dog had a velvety  smooth taste  the condiments didn't \\\"pop\\\" like I expected. The beer list is very impressive and entirely over priced for the small pour.   Do NOT skip desert - The Choco Taco will BLOW YOUR MIND!!! The atmosphere is very cool  informal but not too informal. Our waitress (forget her name) was EXCELLENT!! I'll definitely be back to run through the rest of this very cool menu!\"\n",

      "An update to my previous review  still my favorite indian food in the city. Also  they have a happy hour every week day 5 to 7 and a late night happy hour on food and drinks. Spinach Chaat  GOC Naan  Butter Chicken and Lamb Rogan Gosh are my favorite. It's my home away from home. Thank the lord for this place  possibly the only indian restaurant in Philly that can come close to eating in India.\n",
      "Great ambience   slight mix up. With table availability but they made up for it with the free round of drinks.\n",
      "Three of us ate early here (6pm  Thurs 12/29)  and the food was very good. The service was  well  frenetic in that there were so many people milling about  and the nine dishes we had seemed to come from nine different people. Perhaps they were expecting a large crowd  but it was a bit distracting. We sat close to the kitchen  and a way station. There were several glass crashes during our meal  so we were on our toes.  Highlights were the Shikaari Vermont Quail  Wild Venison Tenderloin Soolay  and Royal Baby Spinach-Arugula Salad. The plain Naan came with three \\dips\\\" (one a powder) that were all very good. I tried the other dishes but cannot remember which was which. The venison was just five or six slices on a bare plate  but was so savory that I would have been satisfied with that alone.  $55 bottle of wine was not worth it  but the Kingfisher beer was a cheap  tasty alternative. Would definitely try again  especially since it's in our neighborhood.\"\n",
      "Tashan's atmosphere is elegant and classy. The food is delicious with a fusion twist. The staff is friendly except for the manager... Thus my 4 star rating. Last weekend we took another couple to Tashan since they have never been. It was my third visit. I called BEFORE coming in to clarify the BYOB policy. A female answered the phone and told me that the restaurant was BYOB and had NO corkage free. This was great! As we were seated  the waiter (who was extremely professional and friendly) told us there would be a $25 corkage fee. I said  HUH? The manager comes to our table. Ghetto fab  by the way. He reiterated the policy (like I didn't hear it the first time from the waiter) and told me that was what we had to pay even though I was given the wrong information over the phone. FYI - there's no corkage fees on Mondays. I'm sorry but you're in the restaurant business.... have a little customer service skills. He didn't even apologize  just continued to tell us what we had to pay. Other then this issue  the food and wait staff is great!\n",
      "Amazing! Tasting menu is great everything was awesome!! One of the best restaurant experiences I have had in philly! Stop reading and go!\n",
      "After checking out the menu and reading the reviews  I was very excited to try Tashan.     I am happy to report that I had a phenomenal experience.   We were promptly greeted by a very friendly  welcoming and accommodating hostess who seated us at what I think was the best seat in the house.  The restaurant is  decked out tasteful modern décor that promotes a fun and exciting experience.   Out server was very attentive  knowledgeable  and personable.  He was a big part of our wonderful experience.   Now on to the food!  We started with three small plates.  The Gol-Gappa had great flavor and the presentation was fantastic.  We were a little surprised at how cold the potato filling was inside.  I understand it's not a warm dish but didn't think it would be refrigerator cold.  Regardless  it was packed with flavor and quite good.   The 2nd small plate was the Baby Octopus Nicobari.  This was absolutely perfect.  I don't think I have ever had octopus so tender.  Lightly seasoned and accompanied by a slightly spicy pepper sauce  this was a 5 star dish all the way.  The third small plate and possibly my favorite of the night was the Kobe Chopan Kebob.  The presentation of this dish is interesting to say the least (depending on your imagination) but the flavor is out of this world!  This was a fantastic five star dish.  Perfectly seasoned and perfectly tender.  I honestly contemplated not trying anything else and ordering more kebob's.  It was that good!  I am glad my wife talked me out of this because I then would of missed out in the Tandoori Butter Chicken.  This is an entrée sized portion that we split.  The sauce in this dish is rich and delicious.  The chicken was tender and full of flavor but when the chicken ran out  we were perfectly content scooping up every last drop of the sauce and eating it over rice. This dish is tied with the Kobe Chopan Kebob for my favorite dish of the night.  I am excited to go back and try more but I know that the Kobe Kebob and Butter Chicken will always be a part of any dining experience I have there.     Well done Tashan!  I'll see you soon\n",
      "A few thoughts on the five course tasting menu (for two):  One course = five bites.  Five bites of this  five bites of that - is there a way to divide five bites between two people evenly? Hmm....  \\We almost forgot - here are your brussel sprouts.\\\"  Umm...you have to wonder  if the last dish of course four is a big helping of chili-lime brussel sprouts  they must not have much confidence in their desserts. Unless brussel sprouts are what you typically have for dessert  obviously.  Mi casa es su casa.  Now entering THE restroom. Genesis had a song called The Chamber of 32 Doors... I'm pretty sure there is some futuristic unisex thing going on here  but I couldn't quite figure out how it works... Ladies  be careful who follows you in there.  \\\"Finally  for course five we have MEH three ways.\\\"  Seriously  the crispy spinach salad was way better than any of the desserts. It was the highlight of a somewhat inspired but not at all memorable meal.  Vanilla sorbet  served cold  check. Tiny plastic cup of MEH chocolate mousse with heavy cream  served cold  check. Mini Creme Brulee around a Gulab Jamun  served cold - WTF?  \\\"Waiter  this Gulab Jamun has been murdered!\\\" And who has ever heard of Creme Brulee served straight from a refrigerator? Can I get some cold french fries with that  monsieur?  Overall  God help us if ordering from the menu isn't more satisfying than this.  Note: This review has been edited for people who don't understand what \\\"tongue in cheek\\\" means.\"\n",

      "Great food - great atmosphere- great service!!  I am pleasantly surprised at how good this place is. Before headed here I knew it was in the top 25 places to eat in Philadelphia but I didn't have a high expectation for it. Im glad I came and ate here. The chicken biryani was great - the small was big enough for 2 people. Samosa chaat was tasty and tandoori shrimp was well done.     The decor is very chic & trendy abate a bit dark. The unisex bathroom is cool.   I'd come back again if I'm in the area.\n",
      "My first time  with the  Restaurant week multi-course menu -- the friend who brought me was right  it's super food  with a good fusion edge to some of the Indian-based menu. This is a restaurant  not  a curry house! Service kind and polite  ambiance pleasing in my view  i'll be back and bring people for sure.\n",
      "I've been here twice. Each time the service is elevated! Beautiful setting  five star customer service  high quality food  and reasonable pricing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deals are great! Happy hour is definitely worth stopping by! Great location and even better atmosphere. The staff are very helpful and attentive. When the weather gets warm the outside bar is a great place to hang.   The mints at the front host's stand are a great treat for the end (or beginning) of your meal.   The sea food bisque is da bomb!!!!   Desserts are huge!\n",
      "Terrible service. I had to wait an entire 30 minutes after being seating for a waitress to even come to get our drink orders. Even after this  they forgot to bring drinks for HALF of the table. We waited for about an hour for our food to come out  and it was subpar at best. Cheap food  but not worth the trouble. Save yourself a headache and eat elsewhere.\n",
      "Pretty decent for for when it's late and you don't feel like cooking. I ordered the fish and chips. The delivery was very speedy and actually came faster than the estimated grub hub delivery time. Can't give it a full two stars though  only because someone was extra heavy handed with the salt.  less than a tsp would have sufficed. I did not need half the whole shaker on my fries. I  honestly was expecting an actual order of traditional chips (Thick sliced potatoes) with my fish not french fries. I'll probably order from them again though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reading the reviews  I'm surprised that so many people have complained about the service.  They're always friendly to Boyd and I.  We go to Landmark often  and we always order the same things.  I've had the grown up grilled cheese before  as well as the seafood bisque and the caesar salad  but I have to say that I can't resist the salmon BLT (sans bacon  of course  but they did give me red onion to supplement the flavor when I asked).  It's not an over-processed patty  it's actual salmon  which is refreshing.  Boyd always enjoys his burgers.  We love the crab fondue.  The highlight of our night is the brownie sundae  I just wish it was big enough to adequately share.  I'm sorry that others have had poor experiences  but Landmark is a frequent favorite of ours when we have some extra money to waste.\n",
      "Definitely one of my top favorite places on campus as a Drexel student- I've been going here since freshman year (shoutout to their contribution to my freshman fifty). The staff is nice and the waitresses/bartenders do pay attention to you as well. Awesome crowd  young and hype keeping the place pretty alive!  They have really good deals every day (i.e. Tuesdays $3 Blue Moons  Thursdays 1/2 off well drinks  etc) and their Happy Hour is great too (discounted appetizers  $3 oak and cokes/sangaria and more). My favorite thing to get are their hot mess fries (it isn't on the menu anymore and comes with cheese  jalapenos  and bacon) and their landmark nachos (I usually get vegetarian because the meat makes it soggy).   Whenever someone visits me  this is my go-to spot- so I'd def recommend this to anyone!\n",
      "I enjoyed this place. The furniture could use an upgrade  but the food was pretty good. And OMG  the brussel sprouts with bacon pieces and balsamic vinegar were the highlight of the meal! Service was good.\n",
      "I came here for a late night dinner during a recent visit to Philadelphia. The location was really convenient  as it was walking distance from where I stayed. Usually I struggle to find something that I want to eat at restaurants that specialize in American fare. This restaurant  however  had a good veggie flatbread. It was nice to have a vegetarian option that had more veggies than bread and cheese. The showstopper was the $2 drink special. Whenever I'm in the area again  I'd stop by again.\n",
      "the steaks were awesome  the curly fries were awesome...and holy crap  they've got a bar! i had two adults and two little ones with me  so me and my friend were able to skip away to the bar for a shot of jager. nice! after that we played a hard core round of 'go fish' with the kids in the booth that we were seated in.   and i need to go back and get the waitresses name. she is the epitome of accommodating. when i asked her to please check out this curly fry that the nephew REALLY needed her to see  she was like \\WOW! ...you get a cookie for having the biggest curly fry ever!\\\" and then she proceeded to shower attention on my little man and dole out the free cookies! she totally made their night happen!  and when the waitress saw my empty water bottle in my hand  she offered to fill it up before we left! i mean  that's just being plain ole' nice!   i'll be back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent proletariat cheese steak place.  We've been here 25 x's or more during the past (I guess) 8 years and have never had a complaint.  The wait staff are friendly and courteous  the cheese steaks are WAY good and the beer is iced cold (and there are always beer specials).    OK....  I don't drink beer but my wife does  and ...and  uh...  I don't eat beef because I'm afraid of mad cow disease (yes  I'm eccentric)  but the chicken cheese steak w pepper jack  their awesome sweet and hot peppers  raw onions  a splash of BBQ sauce and some pickles is out of this freaking world!!!  I just want one right now!    If you're a fan of hot peppers  there are 2 varieties that are well beyond the taste buds of mortal men.  Definitely wash your hands before using the bathroom.    Although I offer 5 stars  the rolls could be crustier  w a good chew  but everything else brings the total to a 5.  Thank you Chubby's!\n",

      "Just wanted to update my last review.  Tonight I was forced to order my late night cheesesteak from Chubby's as my other spot was closed.  Let me just say that the cheesesteak was great!  I realized that I have been ordering cheesesteaks all wrong.  Previously  I have been ordering cheesesteaks with only fried onion  lettuce and tomato.  This time I ordered fired onions  fried peppers  fried mushroom  mayo and ketchup. What a difference!  The cheesesteak was better than my usual spot.  What was even better is that I don't have to have cash when I order here.  Sorry Chubby's for doubting you  it was my fault the whole time.  All I can say is that I was:  \\making a bad cheesesteak\\\"\"\n",
      "I eat here all the time. The staff is great. The place is clean  and the steaks are awsome. Nice pepper bar. They even have beer. Parking is always there. They have fries. Whats not to love.\n",
      "BEST steak's ever! This is the locals boys from the 'iladelph' favorite. \r",
      " \r",
      " Since it was my first time  I thought I go for the orginal sandwich which is ordered \\a steak with\\\" which consists of thinley sliced ribeye  sauteed onion and american cheese on an amaroso roll. dis jawn was bangin' \n",
      "Whenever my husband and I head out to the burbs to visit friends  we like to stop here. Order a cheesesteak and it's yours in just a few minutes. Share some fries  since they give you a lot. The beer list is pretty good  and are cheap (comparably to city prices). They should start selling PBC beer here  because this fun diner is very true to Philadelphia  and you should be able to get a cheesesteak and a local beer here.\n",
      "Chubby's is a pretty cool place. We made the trek from our hotel by the airport to get our favorite cheesesteak for the second time  Dalessandro's  but when we got there the line was out the door and it was packed in there so we said screw it  let's try Chubby's.   The cheesesteak was pretty good  I got American without onions. The beef had good flavor but it could have used some more cheese  next time I'd probably order extra. The cheese fries were also pretty good. The seating area was really nice  we sat at the bar but there was also room at the booths  which seemed nice.   Overall the cheesesteak wasn't on the same level as Dalessandro's  and the cheese fries weren't as good as Ishkabibble's  but I'd go back again because of the nice seating area if Dalessandro's is crazy packed and I wasn't absolutely dying for my favorite cheesesteak.  My current rankings:  1. Dalessandro's  2. John's Roast Pork 3. Gooey Looie's 4. Cosmi's Deli 5. Joe's Steak & Soda Shop 6. Ishkabibble's  7. Chubby's Steaks 8. Jim's Steaks South Street 9. Pat's King of Steaks 10. Geno's Steaks\n",
      "I love Chubby's!  as a PhilaU alumni  Chubby's and Dalessandro's Steaks were the go-to steak shops for us  not Pat's and Gino's.  The Manayunk atmosphere and true Philly style steak meat step up to the plate here at Chubby's.   They get bonus points for having fries and for having nice seating with table service.  They also serve Hank's sodas here  which i love.     the sandwiches are filled high with meat and the employees are always pleasant and helpful. You can also get parking in the small lot on the side  or street parking.  this is my second favorite philly cheese steak!  I dare you to try Chubby's in your quest for the perfect cheesesteak!\n",
      "If you're reading this review then Circles may already be out of business  but please save yourself the horrible experience and just go to Baan Thai on liberty walk.    I went to Circles once when it opened and it was very meh  I figured they would get a little better with time.  Just had dinner there tonight and it was my worst Thai experience for the following reasons: 1. Service was extremely slow.  There were literally three other tables there that had already eaten and took over 45 minutes for food to come out.  2. Got some kind of \\General Thai Chicken\\\" on the special menu.  Two very small pieces of overcooked chicken came out with mediocre veggies.  Wow  $19  really?? 3. This place is hot  balls hot.  I don't need the actual temperature to be hot when eating Thai  i usually sweat it out.  However the food that came out was beyond white person spicy  don't insult me Circles.  4. Bad service in general.  I complained about the chicken dish being ridiculous and they didn't even refund it.  I don't even care about the money  you think restaurants would just do that to avoid more bad reviews online.  I wish Circles would pay attention to the internet more to learn about better cooking and running a restaurant for dummies.\"\n",
      "I came here for a CMYE and had a good time.  The food was yummy with my favorites being the pork with chili plum sauce and the spring rolls.  As far as the tea they were serving (either Thai or chai  the server was hard to hear with the noise)  it was DELICIOUS.  It reminded me of a clove hinted Yoohoo. The servers passing appetizers and serving beer were all incredibly nice  and so was the chef.  I will be back here to try a true dining experience and for a massive amount of that tea.\n",
      "I would like to agree with Ryan  below.  I'm really happy to have a new option in No Libs.  This is a great addition.  This was my first experience with Thai and I have to say  it was absolutely delicious.  My friends and I shared 4 apps (Summer Rolls  Fritters  Calamari and one other that I can't remember) all were very good.  As my main  I got the Pineapple Curry (medium) with chicken.  Amazing!!  I loved every bite of it.  I can't wait to go back and try something else.   The staff was very friendly and attentive.   Will definitely be going back soon!\n",
      "I'm sure the food is great and all  but don't bother trying to order takeout from here.   Ordered Pad Kee Moo  two hours later it still hadn't shown up.  Called up and it turns out that they must have somehow lost the order  because nobody could figure out where it was.   Grumpy and hungry  I ventured out into the cold for a couple of slices.  Heard great things about the food  but who cares if they can't get it to you?\n",
      "What happened to this place? Quality of the food as well as portion sizes went way down.  Peak gai tod was no longer served as whole wings and were completely flavorless. Summer rolls falling apart  sloppily put together  lacked any herbs  and came with watered-down sauce. How far they have fallen.\n",
      "A fellow Yelper once told me that when it comes to ethnic restaurants the true indicator of quality is a majority of the patrons and workers be of the same ethnicity as the restaurant. Well if lovin' the Lord is wrong I don't wanna be right because I didn't see one Thai worker and there may have only been two or three Asians in the entire place  regardless boo and I had our best meal of 2012 there.   We had reservations for 8:00 but it was a Saturday night so we had to wait about ten minutes. Once we were seated the manager stopped by our table to apologize and ask if there is anything we needed to please let him know. Completely unnecessary but a very nice gesture.   Our waitress was extremely friendly and as this was our first time at Circles she walked us through the menu. I've only had Thai once (boo and I's first date in 2008  just picture Along Came Polly capped off with me forgetting my wallet) so I had a lot of questions but she was on top of everything. We ended up getting the pork dumplings and the crab ragoon. Amazing. The ragoon had a lot of curry in it which gave it a really unique flavor that was sweet and a bit spicy. The dumpling wrap was like eating a cloud  and the dipping sauce was out of control.  When it came to the man dishes this was tough because everything sounded great and most options had a beef / poultry / fish option. I have a tough time when there are multiple good sounding options but I was told the chefs specialty is beef and so I went with the green curry with beef and boo went with the pork pad thai. Along with a paint bucket full of wine I got at Pinot the day before  this meal was perfect. The meat in both dishes was beyond tender. The spiciness was just as described which was a relief after my last experience. We even had a little left over and we NEVER have leftovers so this was huge. We ordered two thai coffees to finish up and before we could order dessert the manager brought over thai coffee ice cream for us to share on the house since we had to wait.   Total class all the way. Affordable  delicious  and is now our go to when we have guests in town or just need to have a fail proof delicious meal.\n",
      "My original plan was to be at work tonight eating a sandwich for dinner  but then I was magically cancelled from my shift at the last minute.   The clock was suddenly my friend.    I had time on my hands.    The world was my oyster.    Are you sick of the cliches yet?   So  we decided to head to No Libs to try out Circles.  From the moment we walked in  we were hit with the smells from the kitchen and we couldn't wait to eat.  I immediately told the waitress about my allergies and asked her what she recommended from the menu.  She steered us towards the summer rolls to start off our dinner.  They were a little on the plain side  but it was a huge portion that we were able to split easily and the ingredients were fresh.  She then told us they could make the pad thai vegan without any problems.  It came out and it was cooked perfectly.  I've never had pad thai that good.  We were leaning towards the pineapple curry  but the waitress actually suggested the pumpkin curry since the weather outside had gotten cooler.  I'm so glad she convinced us to switch.  The pumpkin curry was wonderfully rich and creamy and it was a good match for the fall temperatures.    One appetizer and two entrees was a good amount to share between the two of us.  We left Circles happily full and we even had a bit leftover that we were able to take with us.  It goes without saying that I didn't miss my sandwich at all.  I'll definitely be back here at some point.\n",
      "The food is unreal. I mean  actually so good that I remember trying there massaman curry for the first time and actually thinking that it was the greatest thing that I've ever eaten. I would consider getting it on an IV drip. Not to mention everything else I have ever gotten there. I try to make at least a weekly trip and I live about 30 minutes away on the other side of the city. Also  their Jasmine rice is cooked perfectly  which is the most important thing to look for at any place like this. I would give it more then 5 stars if possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "I haven't ventured to as many Thai places as I want to should  but it's my favorite in northern libs. The peanut Thai noodles were awesome.\n",
      "Loved the nachos  best in chestnut hill hands down! Waitress wasn't friendly and service was slow. More than an hour for just nachos and a rice bowl!!! I felt unloved and underappreciated.  I hope she learns to move as fast as my bowels after this dining experience (and thats a positive).\n",
      "We live in Chestnut Hill within walking distance of this restaurant so it is an easy choice especially if it is a pretty Spring night and you want to sit outside  We have been going to El Poquito since its opening. The first time we went the food was good  certainly enough to bring us back. The next time we came the food was not all that good. Not horrible - we thought the chef may have had an off night. Since then  however  the food has gone down hill to the point of it no longer being a place we would go to eat. My husband's tacos were bland and the chicken I got in my dish was so under cooked that I could not eat 3 4's of it. One of our friend's order a mojito and was told they were out of mint! Are you kidding me? We joked that they should be growing mint in the garden! Okay  so that's the food.  But that is not all.  The hosts were rude and unaccommodating.  Just so you know  the restaurant does not take reservations for outside. If you make a reservation  be prepared to eat inside where it is so noisy you cannot hear yourself talk with anyone across the table or wait for an hour and a half so they can seat the walk ins who came in before you because it is a first come- first served policy.  Am I crazy or does that seem a little bass ackwards?  The hosts acted as if we were a pain in the you know what and it was not until two people in our party walked up the street to The Chestnut Grill to look for an outside seat that suddenly an outside table appeared. I wish we had left and gone to another restaurant. El Poquito is expensive and a waste of money. Many restaurants have come and gone from this space  and I suspect this restaurant will find the same fate if they keep treating their customers badly and serving them disgusting food. The one star I did give for this restaurant is solely for the outdoor seating. Maybe you can sit with a drink and not eat. Then it may be worth it.\n",

      "My husband and I were very excited that a legit Mexican restaurant was opening near us and we weren't disappointed.  Unlike some reviewers I found the portions to be perfect.  I could barely finish my third Baja (fried fish) taco.  Everything tasted extremely fresh and was cooked just right.  The guacamole was super- I like it simple  chunky and flavorful.  The Sangria was delicious and the cheese quesadillas from the kid's menu was a big hit for our 4 year old.  The service was DYNAMITE.  Both times we have visited we were totally impressed with the speediness and attention to detail by the servers.  When I came back from the powder room my napkin was folded!  FANCY.\n",
      "Second time to this restaurant  first time everything was spot on  today still good  but some inconsistencies. My Carnitas Tacos were spot on  but the Grilled corn was not grilled but instead boiled or steamed  missing that nice tasty char that makes it special  easy enough to do with any kind of fire  like say  a gas burner. Not sure what happened  the description said grilled. Second  my girlfriends French Toast was described as having plantains on it  but instead had bananas  picky maybe  but a completely different flavor and texture. These little inconsistencies didn't ruin brunch  but I like to see what the menu describes actually end up on the plate  or have someone tell me about the substitution.\n",
      "Came out with friends for a birthday dinner.   Ordered chips and guac and they were very good.  We also had a round of margaritas.   It was hard to decide which tacos we wanted so we split a bunch.   All so good and tasted fresh.  We then ordered the skillet cookie for dessert which was also very good.   I paid with a gift card I received a few months back.  The waitress came back and said it had a balance of $0  which was not true as it was never used.  She grabbed the manager and they tried again will still a $0 balance.   The manager then said it may have been an error on their part and took our word for it.  Very nice customer service!    I loved eating outside and enjoying the wonderful weather.    I need to pick another night to go with friends again.\n",
      "We dined last night with a 6:00 PM reservation on Open Table. We were seated quickly and ordered drinks and one appetizer. Service was good but we then waited 45 minutes for three taco orders. Really? The restaurant was only two thirds full.  The waitress apologized for the long wait but gave no explanation. Food was O.K. but nothing special. Noise level was high even though they were not full. I would not recommend this restaurant as there are many better in the area.\n",
      "The location is good with nice outside seating. The food is average at best  but  unauthentic. The real problem was the price  in my opinion it is outrageous. I have been a few times hoping that it would get better to justify the price. The staff is hit or miss. I have had a very bad interaction  mediocre interaction  as well as excellent service. There is so much potential for the location and I truly hope they turn this place into something special.\n",
      "Located in lovely Mt Airy which holds much love and fond memories for me since we once lived in Philadelphia.   On a balmy summer night  it was with friends that we decided to dine at El Poquito.   We were seated outside  cocktails and food items offered  fireflies overhead  we enjoyed joyous convo and food  I found El Poquito to be a jocund location.   Will return someday.\n",
      "I had high hopes  especially as someone who lived in the California Bay Area for 7 years  but similar to others we left disappointed.  In short - 5 star atmosphere  1 star service  2 star food.  We made a 6:30 pm reservation on the evening of Memorial Day and we're seated immediately at a nice table outside.  We were excited.  Ordered shrimp ceviche  carnitas tacos  veracruz tacos for the adults and a chicken taco for our toddler.  Even though we put in the order right after we got there and got the ceviche appetizer about 15 minutes later  it took an additional 45 minutes to get our entrees (7:45 PM)!  The place was half full and and 2 guys sat next to us 15 minutes after we go there and had a 2 course meal and were paying their check as we were getting our entrees.  Needless to say  making a toddler wait an hour for food is criminal - there's only so far crayons can get you.    Our waitress barely apologized  it almost seemed as if she was avoiding us.  Luckily  the manager noticed  and took our drinks and kids meal off the check and profusely apologized.  It would have been all good if the food was amazing  but it wasn't.  - carnitas tacos - good - but hard to mess up anywhere - veracruz tacos - terrible.  would never use cod for fish tacos.  Oily  bland  fishy tasting.  Got to use mahi mahi or wahoo.  Would have been much better if they defrosted the Trader Joe's fish veracruz and put that on some corn tortillas.  And by the way  these were severed on flour tortillas which is only ok if you're going to taco bell.   - salsa verde - way too much lime - ceviche - tasted kind of syrupy  and not served with chips so there's nothing to cut that taste  Because of the atmosphere and location and the manager coming over and apologizing we'll consider giving it another shot  but for now it just left a sour taste in our mouths and cranky toddler to deal with who got home past her bedtime.\n",

      "Ordered the PFD sandwich and a regular cheese pie  both were amazing...you really taste the freshness in every bite. It's hard to find a sandwich and pizza to this quality in the same joint but this place has it down! Will definitely be my new go to pizza spot.\n",
      "This pizza is ridiculously good. Probably in my top 3 in Philly. I like how they offer both thin and think crust  and I honestly couldn't decide which I liked better since they were both amazing. Do note that we came when it wasn't terribly busy and waited about 40 mins for 3 pies. There's no seating options inside as this seems like more of a take out place. Definitely worth it!\n",

      "My boyfriend has always found something wrong with food I rave about  until I brought Angelo's Upside Down Jawn home. A bite into his second slice he said we had to make sure we wrapped the leftovers really well so we could eat it again the next night. No phone  cash only. Definitely worth it\n",
      "Angelo's Pizza is Incredible - They go the extra mile to serve excellent Pizza. The Upside Down Jawn is killer  I love the thick crust on this Pizza. It's to hard to explain why  just go taste it now. I also like to order custom made pizza's where I pick the toppings. Angelo's toppings are the highest quality ingredients. The cheese  sauce  pepperoni and sausage taste far better than most pizza establishments. The portions are huge. The sandwiches also look really good as well but I haven't tried them yet (and they even make the bread / rolls in house). Friendly and helpful staff. So happy I live nearby. Nice to see a Pizzeria focused on serving the best Pizza without shortcuts (and likely a hit to their bottom line in the process).    Highly Recommended  BK\n",
      "The best pizzeria that I've been to in a long time  the ingredients that they use are top of the line  the cheese that they grated on top of my meatball sandwich was delicious  I also had a slice of pepperoni pizza and the pepperoni  could be the best that I've had\n",
      "\n",
      "This review I'm about to write is 100% true and not at all a lie or exaggeration in any way although I wish it were. My buddy and I found this pizzerias Instagram and were initially blown away by the pictures. The pizzas looked great and the hot sandwiches on the overly seeded rolls looked fantastic. We decided to give it a try. The first sign that this experience was going to be a let down was when I initially walked in the place. Barren white walls. One single metal table with 2 chairs and for some reason the place was 90% kitchen and everything was open so all you heard were the loud sounds of the dough being made by machine and cooks loudly talking in the back. Then I ordered a soda. A root beer to be exact. They carry some off brand name I've never heard of and it was awful. Just carry Coca Cola products or something normal. I don't need a craft root beer just a mug or an A & W or something. Okay so we decide we're going to order a plain pie and a cheesesteak. The cheesesteak comes out and it's a cheesesteak I can get anywhere. Not awful but nothing special. The big let down was the bread. It had no seeds whatsoever and looked like a roll you'd get at wawa not a place that claims it makes \\homemade Italian bread\\\". Then the pizza came out. My brother  my friend and I opened the box and everyone went silent. The second we opened it you could just tell it was completely and utter slop. Almost no sauce and way too much cheese. A good pizza should almost have a tan look to it when it comes out of a pizza oven. The crust should be dark and the oil should give the pizza an orange color. This pizza came out and was pale white. The worst part was that there was like a white liquid in the middle. Almost like the cheese has liquified into milk. From the undercooked crust to no oil drip  to no sauce  to globs of cheese it just didn't look right. So finally we decide we're going to try a slice. The second we ripped the slices apart all the cheese fell right off into a glob in the middle. I ended up eating dough and then a glob of cheese separately after each slice piece of dough. That was an embarrassing pizza and if I owned a pizzeria and had any pride I wouldn't have served it. This guy continues to post food that looks delicious on his instagram but it's all a lie. We were literally food catfished and he continues to dupe people to this day. He won't be in business long. His bread is awful  his pizzas atrocious  there's no where to sit  the list goes on and on. The woman at the counter also asked what 4 times before comprehending literally any part of the order. That was just the icing on this mess of a cake. Honestly I'm not even covering all of it but it's been like a month since I was there and can't remember every little detail we were criticizing when we were there. Unfortunately when we went at first this place didn't have a yelp page yet. The man is lying about the food he makes and gladly serving up slop and pretending he is some sort of new kid on the block that is a threat to the well established pizzerias of Philadelphia. Embarrassing. I'll never be back  I tell all my friends  family  and co workers to not waste their time making a trip over there  and the man deserves to go out of business. I've had some of the best pizza in the world in New York and Santuccis which is literally right up the block. I know good pizza and this ain't it. He should stop lying about his bread too. I can only imagine what other foods he makes that are a complete falsehood on social media but I'll never be back to try anything there again. There's too much good pizzerias and delis too close to him for me to waste my money.\"\n",
      "Serious shoutout to the exceptional service here for hosting large groups. We had many changes to our reservation  from 6 to 12 people  and the service was polite  patient  and wonderful considering we were a BYO group (maybe NYC service has just jaded me....)  Food pretty good for the price  albeit a little salty. We came for dinner this time and while I much prefer the brunch items  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the lamb. Obviously the best perk about coming for dinner is BYO.\n",
      "This place is amazing!!! The almond-crusted french toast = OMG. It was not too buttery or too sweet (I normally don't like french toast much because it always tastes so buttery inside and the texture was just too soft for me). But THIS french toast  wow... The whipped cream was really thick and fresh (the berries were okay  kinda mushy  but whatever). My sister thinks this was the best french toast she's ever had  even better than Sabrina's!   The shrimps and grits dish was great too. I really liked the shrimp  and the grits was pretty good. The brussels sprouts were pretty good too but a bit sweeter than I would've liked (what with figs and candied walnuts). And it wasn't salty enough for me. It was a tapas dish but was quite big  basically like an entree.   This was a great  very filling brunch. We were already full after the french toast and the shrimps and grits. We probably shouldn't have gotten the brussels sprouts  but everything was delicious here. There weren't many people (I don't think it's as well-known as other brunch places  and it isn't near bakeries/cafes  like brunch places in Center City  so it was a bit too isolated for people  but I like how it's not crowded here. Kind of like a hidden gem). The house interior was really nice  clean  and spacious but also cozy.\n",
      "One of my favorite restaurants  great flavors and spices. You must go for brunch and have the shrimp and grits and order extra grits  they are that good! I like every item on the menu  the flavors are unique and the portions are perfect. I would suggest making a reservation because the resturant is small and popular  plus it's a byob.\n",
      "\n",
      "Went here a couple of weeks ago after passing it on the Trolley a million times!  I will say that the service here is amazing - our server immediately noticed our table was wobbly so she found reinforcements.  She was kind  considerate  and got our check ready quickly when we realized we lost track of time and were running late.  I liked the decor and the look of the food as well - pretty fancy without being stuffy.  The fried pita-ish looking strips were gorgeous and very ... modern cuisine.  Cool!  Our entree and appetizer were not quite what I expected - we had the fried artichokes and the vegetable tagine.  The artichokes could have used more seasoning and we used the mustard-y dipping sauce to pep them up.  The tagine came with what looked like large-pearl couscous (it even mimicked acini pepe pasta) and the sauce was more tomato-based/acidic than the deeper-flavored sauce am used to.    So I will say the experience overall was A-OK  as I am not running back for more  but would go again and try some more dishes.\n",
      "Surprisingly Good...didn't think I would much like Morroccan  but it was very good...I had the chicken & shrimp  the Wife had the salmon with a shared small plate for an appetizer (which could have a enough for one!)...will definitely return...\n",
      "I visited Aksum this past Sunday for brunch with a group of 8. We ate outside on the side walk. The food was really great and was a great portion size. Although we didn't bring any  the restaurant is byob.   The staff is really friendly and the manager accommodating. However the service could use some work. They couldn't find our reservation  tried to sit 8 people at two tables and crowd us around it even though there were free tables available  messed up our orders  and the bill.   Perhaps going with a smaller party is better.  The food is definitely worth a visit up on Baltimore.\n",
      "There will never be enough BYOBs in the world  so I love that another one cropped up in my neighborhood. I came here with 2 other people on a weekday night  and it was all we could hope for and more. The casual service and the classy decor seem at odds with each other  but once we stopped expecting the super-swank treatment  we enjoyed ourselves.  None of us were hungry  so we shared a couple of tapas. There was no pressure to order more  and we thoroughly enjoyed the food. I wouldn't expect something as simple as a strawberry and avocado salad to be notable  but the one at Aksum is super tasty. I could eat five of those.   Our server (I want to say her name was Maggie  but I'm not 100% sure) was fantastic  and made the night that much better. We will definitely be stopping by again.\n",
      "I went to Aksum during their opening week. At that point  they largely had a test kitchen. It was alright. It was a test menu: a few sauces  meats  and starches were being mixed around.   Last night  I'm hopeful that Aksum will continue to provide quality food at a reasonable price in our neighborhood.  My friend initially ordered fried calamari to share. So rarely is this a good move in a restaurant  I was thrilled to have succulent  delicate  and flavorful little fruits of the sea.   We all had the special  grilled cod on a bed of shiitake and faro   in a lemon cream sauce with a few roasted asparagus stems. It was great. Really great. The asparagus and the faro had real texture  just on the right side of chewy. The cod was cooked wonderfully. Our service was a bit inconsistent  but this issue aside  I was thrilled by my experience.   If you  live out west but are thinking of going to a BYO in Rittenhouse  consider Aksum one of these times.\n",
      "Your review helps others learn about great local businesses. A great neighborhood BYO with really good food and great service. The food is so reasonably priced  it's tempting to order too much.  We had a special - crab bisque that was mildly spicy and delicious.  All the other appetizers we ordered were great  and the main courses were generous and tasty.  The chef even comped us a delicious dessert.   We're tempted to go back...everyday Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review  or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "After reading a lot of positive reviews  we were really excited to try this place. We were extremely disappointed in the food. I'm going to give the place the benefit of the doubt that it is not always like this as we came in at 10 PM  but if you cannot offer quality food at that hour then don't have your kitchen open.  All of our food came out within 5 to 10 minutes of ordering which leads me to believe it was not made fresh. The Caesar salad was room temperature and overdressed. The hush puppies were flavorless  and the chicken wings (3 full wings is a serving) were undercooked and barely warm. The only redeeming food item was the chicken and biscuits  which had a nice flavor profile- the biscuit was again  cold in spots.   On the positive side the place has a nice hip atmosphere and the service is friendly.   Unfortunately  the food was so sub par we would not consider dining here again.\n",
      "Bourbon & Branch is the GO TO spot for anything...brunch  lunch  dinner  late night..you name it. The food is SPECTACULAR (especially for my vegans vegetarians out there)  drinks are amazing and the overall atmosphere and service is wonderful. A super chill spot for literally any meal or any occasion. If you're in the neighborhood  gotta check it out!\n",
      "\n",
      "Great place! Right around the corner from where we live and we also go at least once a week... The cocktails are yummy...food is yummy... The bartenders are always friendly and attentive. Our favorite small plate is the cheese plate... perfect with a glass of beer or mixed drink. The atmosphere is perfect - cozy  dim lighting  and relaxed. They have 1 TV so if you want to watch a game its on...but its not in-your-face bright and they don't have the volume on...Thank you for that!  Love this place  and we are so happy its in our hood! Cant wait to try their brunch!\n",
      "Wow. The food  atmosphere  and service here are all phenomenal.   Let me start with my favorite part - the menu is pasted into children's books which is so cool!  The atmosphere is hipsterish - dim lighting  great music  and laid back vibe. I went on a Sunday for brunch and it was not too crowded  easy to walk in and get seated without a wait.   SO MUCH BETTER THAN GREEN EGGS in my opinion.   After much deliberation between various items  I ordered the chicken and waffles and in the words of DJ Tanner  OH MY LANTA. The seasoning on the chicken was beyond delicious (not dry at all  which is a complaint I often have about chicken) and the waffles were crisp and perfectly done. The syrup was not too rich and sweet and you could tell it was authentic  not the sugary thick store bought stuff.   In addition  I have to say  I found the HOLY GRAIL of biscuits. These are not your small round KFC biscuits. They are HUGE  soft  mushy  delicious  amazing. I have been craving them every day since. They have cheddar bits baked inside and when you pull these freshly baked delights apart and take a bite  I guarantee a religious experience.  If you can't tell  I loved this place.  My only complaint -  Why haven't I been here before?!\n",
      "Excellent food  the biscuits and gravy were amazing. Cool building and design inside as well  was a good spot for Sunday brunch\n",
      "I'll keep it short and sweet - great food  but consistently worst service in Philly. Everyone knows it  too. I know a dozen people who go there weekly as their neighborhood bar and even they are exasperated by how consistently awful the service is. Good luck getting acknowledged  greeted  served  offered water  given a menu  getting checked up on. It's never excessively busy - they just don't seem to know how a bartender server is supposed to treat customers. Really  this spot would be amazing if it ever got any people behind the counter who gave a damn about what they were doing.\n",
      "I want to give this a 4 (I am indeed a fan!) but I think I need to go back after this place has been open for awhile to reassess.  Upon entering  we were greeted by who I think was the owner or manager - a very dapper older gent sitting at the bar. He was really friendly and welcoming.  I thought putting the cocktail menu in the children's book was really cute  but I agree that it could use some work. I was also a little disappointed to see only a handful of whiskey drinks on the menu - I thought this was a whiskey/bourbon-centric speakeasy-esque bar? Nevertheless  I was overall pleased with my drink. I got the Branch Whiskey Sour and thought it was refreshing  if not a slight bit on the watery side. Funny enough  I don't like my drinks to taste like gasoline  but I wanted this one to taste a bit more boozey.  My boyfriend had their house Manhattan and loved it  though. I really think this place has promise! We'll definitely be back to check out a show in a few weeks  and I'm really hoping they'll work out the kinks quickly. It's pretty exciting to have a bar like this in the neighborhood.\n",

      "Haven't had many cheesesteaks in my life but this one makes me wanna have more! It was a mandatory experience during our 1 day visit and this place was a delicious experience. The meat is not ground but consists of thinly sliced strips  which makes it even better. Yum! The staff was friendly and provided prompt service. The bathrooms were kind of dirty but at least they have one.\n",
      "I'd been eyeing this place on my commute for almost a year. They really spruced it up and made that corner look a lot cheerier and I like that they seemed to keep some of the \\charm/kitch\\\" of the previous diner's style. I guess I wanted to be blown away by the food and the experience and it was perfectly lovely  but probably not crave-able. I will return next time I don't want to drag my tourist visitors to Pat's.  Thumbs up for: -The service. Our waitress was pleasant and attentive.  -PICKLE BAR!!  -Milkshake (a few options  including a seasonal flavor) was pretty dang good  as were the cheese fries -- perfectly crinkle cut.  Thumbs down for: -The hot sausage sandwich with whiz. I don't know what I was expecting  but the sausage was flat  like a flat patty and overly whizzed. This is a hard feat  as I love cheese and lots of it  but this was just too much.  -Seemed slightly over priced for something that I usually buy out of a truck on most corners of the city.\"\n",
      "This place sucks an ass. Half of the staff just sits around while you wait 30 minutes for a cheesesteak. Go anywhere else. Seriously  don't waste your time. Go hungry. It's not worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cool spot on the corner of Frankford Avenue if you want a good cheesesteak fix. I went there with two other people snd were greeted with a nice welcome. It wss also awesome wr can sit down with iur beers from the Fishtown Fest outside. Our waitress was nice and willing to answer any questions we had about the menu.  The steaks are a bit pricey  and can reach close to double digits. I got a chicken cheesesteak and split buffalo chicken fries with my girlfriend. The sandwich was great since it was actual chicken breasts snd not that thin slab of chicken. Also I loved the buffalo chicken fries! You can also get some fixins at the pickle/pepper bar. I enjoyed my experience and hope to return.\n",
      "Let's put it this way they had a vegan option . It was decent   but when i think cheese steak   i think greasy goodness   which this lacked. It is a hipster version of cheese steak. Serivce great  decor retro .... amazing pickles!!!!\n",

      "Terrific steak sandwich. Owner was great. Beats the other \\known\\\" neon lit pretenders. This is genuine and the real deal. Most importantly the friendly attention to clients was absolutely a surprise.   I would recommend this to anyone looking for the absolute best!!!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Came up from DC for the day with family in town from MN - wanted something that's not touristy or overrated - found this place. And we were all so happy with our food.  Everything was delicious! My beef (hah!) with cheesesteaks in general is how greasy they can get but this was perfect - just slightly so and all went to the bottom of the sub. Prov and whiz combo - OMG!  We all were so stuffed that we ended up not getting dinner before leaving Philly. It was that good and we were that satisfied!  Thank you!\n",
      "The greatest cheesesteak I've e'er known. The people are always insanely friendly and the cheesesteaks are just amazing. I cannot say enough about them.  Just knowing they exist gives me renewed hope in humanity.\n",
      "Great food! Pats is just comecial like Genos. Filled and packed with cheese and beef  there's no room for the non nessesaties. The thick hot sauce is a supreme topper with the added Katchup without mustard with a tad of may-o\n",

      "This is THE most original  authentic hoagie in Philadelphia. Fresh  thinly sliced deli meats and cheeses piled in a seeded roll.  All the vegetables are thinly sliced and generously piled on top.  Don't forget to ask for those sweet peppers!  The shop is very busy mainly takeout orders as they only have two small card tables to eat in.  It's fun to sit there while eating and watch an \\old school\\\" Philly Italian deli in action.  Staff was friendly.  While you're there  walk down the block to Termini's Italian bakery and pick up a few treats for later.  Better yet if you re driving  park in Termini's lot and walk down to Cosmi's as parking is tight in the area.  There are many hoagie shops in Philly and some popular tourist shops but this is the BEST hoagie in town!\"\n",
      "This was the best Cheese Steak I've had in Philly. I've been eating steaks for years  rarely do I go to the big guys on 9th St. I find the smaller locals really make awesome sandwiches. However  nobody has topped Cosmi's  they are absolutely the best. I did not even know they made sandwiches till I saw them on yelp!   My husband and I enjoyed their steak fries also.\n",
      "i've frequented this place ever since i found out about it. the food is excellentttttt. yummy sandwhiches  cosy mom and pop atmosphere.  however this is the last time i'll be coming back  or recommending this place.  one of the men who usually rings me up (he has a twin)  started going off on me when i asked him how long it would take  raised his voice and walked away. Not everyone who asks this question is implying they need or want faster service.  Infact there have been several times where I've had to sit for an additional 10-20 minutes after ordering online... It's never been an issue for me personally.   I understand how busy they can get and food service can be stressful. I also know now they prioritize online orders via his response that if i had ordered it online when i walked in... that it would come out sooner? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  keep doing everything the same  just lose the shitty attitude.\n",
      "Cosmi's catered my daughter's first birthday party. We've ordered takeout from them a handful of times  but wouldn't say they were on heavy rotation although they sure are now. Mike (the owner?) was nothing but pleasant  accommodating and easy to work with. He asked me how much I wanted to spend and made suggestions on the menu  knowing how families in South Philly like to eat (which is  a lot). We had macaroni  meatballs  sausage  salad  sandwiches  appetizers  etc  all delicious and for a reasonable price  with plenty left over. Mike came to my venue with a team to set up and thought of every detail. He even understood that I was a little unhinged because due to the weather  our outside party suddenly became an inside party  and did his best to calm my nerves. I cannot say enough good things about Cosmi's and truly hope you will consider them for your next event. I will most definitely use them in the future for my catering needs!\n",
      "I live above this OCF   and I also lived above Mug Shots when it was here  and I have to say OCF IS WAY BETTER! The sandwiches are phenomenal (fig and brie & the roast beast are my faves) and the is friendly and helpful.  I'm so glad they moved in (and feel bad it's taken me this long to write a review)   ALSO: make sure to try their specials  they're ALWAYS out of this world!\n",
      "One of my favorite spots to do work. High quality coffee  nice variety of brunch options (served all day)   The only downside is that the wifi isn't always the greatest and it takes them awhile to make drinks sometimes.\n",
      "Looking up breakfast places for our trip to Philadelphia. Located across the street from Eastern State Penitentiary was a great café.  To be honest it's a little pricier then what is labeled on Yelp. But no matter  I felt it was well worth it.  What did I find here? Inspired brews! Kombucha made right here in Philadelphia  I think that's awesome to see a small operation with such a great presence.  This café had plenty of options. Breakfast was delicious. We opted for French toast with slabs of turkey bacon. Not that overly processed stuff  thus was like hearty turkey bacon!  Cappacino was delightful  the presentation was aesthetically pleasing with the fern design. I know  I sound like a total douche. Cappacino was delicious either way. Don't look at me like that  shut up.  Service was very good. And it's set up as a self-cleaning type operation with the bins for dishes by the trash. The place was clean  and very busy. There's also a section on one side for you to set up with your laptop  that area was packed. It must of had outlets. Also nice because I think this place has WiFi.\n"

      "I'm a big fan of this new addition to Fairmount.  It's super spacious with plenty of seating and it's very well lit with bright walls and a clean  fresh ambiance.  When its nice out  they open the big garage-door style windows for an open layout--very nice touch now that Fairmount can be hard to snag in the warmer weather months.  Their coffee is priced comparable to the other coffee shops in the 'hood... which was a little disappointing.  I was hoping this place would have great prices that would hopefully drive down the cost of a cup-o-Joe in Fairmount.  That being said  they have a big menu with a BYO option for Mimosas and Bloody Mary's.  Me likey.  They have some classic coffee-shop food choices  with some new funky twists (tomato  basil and goat-cheese cornbread?).  Again  I was kind of hoping this place would serve up some more inexpensive options... but I'll take what I can get.\n",
      "Coffee is good - apple cider is completely amazing. I'll give it four stars bc the beverages are good  it's a nice  big open space. The drawback is the food. I've never had a good food experience here.   It always sounds like what you order is going to be good and then it comes out pretty disappointing.   Examples: egg sandwich - how can you mess an egg sandwich up? By having way too large of a slab of soggy eggs in a chewy bagel.  Yesterday's beef and potato soup was bland and gave me indigestion all afternoon.   Will go back for beverages.\n",
      "It's not hard to give a cafe like OCF top ratings when it all comes together like it did on the afternoon we stopped in...  The service from Meredith  the food and the ambiance all clicked.  Meredith was awesome... a combo of personable  professional and attentive. Kudos to her!  The food was great. So much to choose from- coffee  smoothies  wraps  sandwiches  veggie dishes and baked goods.   OCF is a terrific spot for a casual meal where you can connect to wifi  study or just relax and watch the world go by.\n",
      "Before I run the Kelly Drive loop  OCF Coffee House is the perfect pit stop in Fairmount.  I load up on their generous breakfast plate of egg whites  warm whole grain toast  and rosemary potatoes.  It's a testament to their healthy and clean food preparation that I haven't hurled on Kelly Drive yet.  I also appreciate their early bird morning hours and they serve brunch through the entire day (fist pump).  Eat like a champion  run like a champion.\n",
      "Great food- had some trouble connecting to wifi and the employees were not sure why  but overall a good experience\n",
      "This place has far and away become my favorite study spot.  I love that it's spacious and gets so much natural light.  It makes long days of studying seem not so bad.  The staff is super friendly and everyone seems generally happy in there.  The music is always good  and it's never too loud.  The food is excellent.  Perhaps it is a little pricey  but I generally find the portions and quality to be decent enough that it doesn't make the food outrageously priced.  Nothing I have eaten here has been bad  and at this point I am pretty sure I have explored almost the entire menu.  The drinks are good  but I think they are overpriced.  $2.75 for a decent  but not great  cup of coffee is a little extreme.  The iced coffee situation is especially troublesome because they do not give refills on iced coffee.  You have to pay full price if you want another one.  This is kind of insane and frustrating  especially if you're sitting in there all day and studying.  I would say maybe they don't want lingerers  but no one has given me crap about being there for 8 hours at a time  and I generally spend at least $10/visit if I'm there that long  so I don't really understand the problem.  The outlet situation is good  but not great.  There are a lot of people who set up shop in this place  so sometimes getting to a plug can become competitive.  However  I generally find that if I sit down elsewhere  I can move to a spot closer to the wall within 30 minutes.    Finally  they accept credit cards  which is a major plus in my book.  All in all  this is a great addition to the neighborhood  and by far my favorite study haunt in the area.\n",
      "Wide variety of brunchy food with many GF options. Very good coffee in an open + friendly atmosphere. Reasonable egg sandwich on gluten free bread is $4.50. Anodyne coffee is ok too  espresso is better. Bright froggy green is the signature OCF color so there is that too.\n",
      "Cocktails review only.  So first off  while we didn't try any of the food  we saw a good bit of it walking by and it all looked delicious. Now to the good stuff. First  the drinks aren't cheap.  You're going to pay easily 12 bucks for a cocktail. But what a cocktail. The guys making these drinks aren't so much bartenders as they are artists. Their attention to detail is meticulous  their knowledge of their ingredients is boundless  and their execution is flawless.  Ryan in particular knows his stuff.  Fantastic mixologist all the way around.   The bar is extremely well stocked with probably hundreds of different liquors. We didn't drink wine  but the menu suggested hundreds of choices there as well. I only briefly glanced at the beer selection but the choices were there as well.   A quick aside about beer. If you're in a bar of this quality  don't order a miller lite. Seriously. It's like going to a Morton's or Ruth's Chris and wanting an Oscar Meyer hot dog. Just... don't.   Anyhow  the wife and I stayed across the street for a long weekend and found ourselves coming back to this same spot for after dinner drinks every night. Highly recommended.\n",
      "First off the space is gorgeous  live the decor and the service is nice and efficient. The stars are for the ridiculous portions of food. One dish was the spare ribs and it was literally ONE spare rib. Laughably small these portions were  especially for the prices which weren't cheap. The taste was also not worth it. While I appreciate what the place is trying to do and I could see it being a great place to go if they address this  our group left still hungry and irritated and no one is itching to go back for a meal.\n",
      "The food was excellent  especially the steak and bread pudding. My drink was great but I only got 1 because we barely saw the waiter and never got the fries we ordered. It was a friday night during restaurant week but they were significantly under-staffed.\n",
      "Got to hotel around 8pm. Wanted a light dinner  so choose a starter. Had a wonderful pasta ragu  and since it was a starter it was the perfect size. Staff friendly  food came out fast. Atmosphere is loud  seems to be a meeting place for whatever crowd is in the hotel. Food looked good around me  big portions and pricey.\n",
      "We went in on New Years Day around 3:30 PM. The bar was mostly empty  so we easily got a seat at the small bar in the lounge. Waited 5 minutes before we got greeted. We were starving  but only the small bar menu was being offered. We ordered drinks and an order of french fries. The bloody Mary's were mediocre (wasn't expecting them to be amazing  but could have been better). The fries however took 25 minutes to come out. We asked several times why they were taking so long and it was blamed on the food runner. When they finally arrived they were cold and greasy. We were planning on staying for dinner  but instead paid our bill and went elsewhere.\n",
      "When you want to have a nice meal  but still feel relaxed. Price point is reasonable and the menu is rather inventive. All of the appetizers are delicious: barrata  rosemary fries  cauliflower...you really cant go wrong. However  my roasted duck entree was a little sub-par and I was not won over by the flavors. There was a lot going on on the plate - many different sauces  fruits  textures. Needless to say it became a little busy.   For dessert I sampled the mint chocolate sundae which was average  but the bourbon maple pie was TO DIE FOR. It tasted more like an apple cobbler and I couldn't detect any maple flavor but it was definitely my favorite part of the meal.\n",
      "Great service  great food  nice restaurant design. Jose was an attentive and friendly server! The biscuits with brunch were awesome! Also  get the bourbon donuts! Nice spot.\n",
      "OK--It's Thanksgiving. You're at a manly-man's upscale restaurant in an impressive Center City landmark. Even if they're serving hundreds of the same meal  that meal should be exceptional.  Our servers were attentive  pleasant  and informative.  The ham sampler was excellent. The three \\pierogies\\\" were quarter-sized Panko-encrusted filo leaves stuffed with creamed spinach worthy of any good Greek taverna. With the exception of the turkey dressing  everything on both our plates was cold  dry  and unencumbered by taste. The mashed sweet potatoes were an artistic smear across the plate. The pumpkin pie was strictly from Mrs. Smith  and soggy  at that. If only the entire meal could have been as good as the pear cobbler.  We might be interested in trying this place again  but not on a holiday. So MANY other good restaurants in town....\"\n",
      "Hotel prices  food was fine. The artichoke soup left something to be desired. The bartender Kevin was nice and helpful.\n",
      "My boyfriend and I came here last night for our two year anniversary and we were very impressed by the food and the service. We both agreed that it was the best steak we'd ever had in Philadelphia. Our server and the water pourer were very attentive and pleasant and our water glasses never stayed empty. My boyfriend owns a high-volume restaurant in Philadelphia and has been in the business for over 20 years and we can both easily say that we received the best service here than any other restaurant in the city.   Also our server recommended the pork belly as a starter and we had the walnuty apple pie and chocolate cake for dessert  they were all delicious. As someone who doesn't like too much chocolate the cake was the best I've ever had from a restaurant. I think we've finally found a place we will look forward to going back to.   I should also add that the hostess was so kind to offer to take our picture as many times as we wanted and in our choice of lighting. Overall we were very pleased. Thank you to everyone at Bank and Bourbon for making our night so wonderful and memorable.\n",
      "The staff is attentive  the food excellent and the venue terrific.  This is a great place for a really good  quiet meal.  One of my top favorites in South Philly.\n",
      "I am a picky eater (mostly vegetarian)  so am always skeptical when it comes to restaurants with \\fancier\\\"  more unique menus. Not only did le virtu have great vegetarian options  the service was off the charts amazing. Our waitress was attentive  friendly and very knowledge about the menu (even offering historical tidbits round various menu items.)  I recommend this place highly to picky and non-picky eaters alike!!\"\n",
      "This place is bad...wait for it...ass.   If you want AUTHENTIC italian food  this is the place to go.  I cannot tell you how much the fare at this location reminded me of my trips to Italy.   I unfortunately only had a short meal here  but I will be back for a full course dining experience to fully partake of everything that looked delicious on the menu.      The other 3 members of my party were in complete agreement with me in between the sound of their chomping away.    Service was very good  ambiance was above average.    Only detraction was that the bar area had a cellar-ish smell to it  but we sat outside.\n",
      "Great atmosphere and had a fantastic time  but food and wine were not world class or long term memorable (except for some pork skin in the last secondi).\n",
      "Experience was almost glorious. Aside from the barkeeps \\Indian Pale Ale\\\" gaff  capable but not a student of the Art  the staff was affable and competent.  Our waiter  for a table of seven  was a true pro. Never a moment passed when anyone was in need of anything.  Aside from sis's ScIrpelle soup delay. It gave us all time to \\\"share\\\" it  after our antipasto.  Transitions were smooth and timely. Entrees were indeed worth the $$$. Country Farm(Berks County)  assumed pasture raised  pork sampler special was great. Seasoned to perfection and properly done. Monkish with mussels and clams was devoured. Pasta was comparable to most homemaders. Nana was best.    Fine wine and beer selection. Avery Maharaja's Imperial IPA was out.  Often a tough find anywhere east of the Rockies. Plenty of fine substitutions.   Parking was easy enough for a Friday.\"\n",
      "Just stunning! I'm a very good cook  and THIS is where I go when I want food that kicks my food's butt. Note: this is NOT a  meatball joint  this is real Italian food the way Italians eat it. The homemade salumeria is authentic and delicious. Get the salumeria platter for a first course or to share at the bar. The pastas are so perfect. Everything is cooked with such care and skill. Beyond the food  I love the mural over the bar and the look and atmosphere of the place. The wine list has wonderful and unusual selections that compliment this rare food. And the bartender makes a darned good martini  too.  The staff can be a bit distracted form time to time  but I have never had bad service. Everyone is treated well-- not just 'insiders.' The owners are charming and welcoming. May they live well and prosper! They've given Philly a jewel.\n",
      "If Le Virtu were a woman she'd be too good for me. I was completely blown away with my meal here. I know this will sound like sacrilege to some but I am not a big fan of italian food. In fact  typically I down right don't like it. My wife is a huge fan of italian food and she is constantly trying to get me to go at it again and again. Well I've found the promise land and it is good. I can't wait to go back.  Everything is fresh  local and made on site. Even if no one told you that you could taste it in each bite. I was with a group and we shared each of our dishes. I ate cured meats  soft shell crab  duck  gnocchi  a little bit of everything - I didn't have one bad fork-full.\n",
      "Pretty decent place. Tried a variety of dishes and liked most of it. The prices here are pretty reasonable for a 'high end' restaurant. I would say expect about $60 a head. For some oddball reason (I suspect it was the alcoholics at the table) the bill was almost $600 for six people for us  however. But the prices on the menu were about $27 for the main dish  and about $20 for the starter dishes. I was impressed with the portion size as well. Usually there seems to be some non-logical inverse relation between the price you pay and the amount of food that you get  but here you could get full on a main dish and 1-2 small dishes (I have a big appetite  take away a smaller dish for those who eat bird meals)   My favorite dish was the Goat Gnocchi. The taste was very sharp and the gnocchi was firm. Also the semifroddo chocolate cake dessert was excellent.   My least favorite was the tripe and I was like  \\Who ordered this sh_t?\\\" Both my and my girlfriend's stomachs felt a little weird over the next two hours. I can only imagine that this dish was the cause but not entirely sure.  . Unfortunately  our waitress didn't bring or wrapped leftovers back to the table!! Such a disappointment.  In the beginning  she also asked if we wanted Philadelphia tap water or bottled water. Was New Jersey water or Chicago water an option  or something?   It felt a little cramped and the temperature kept shifting from very hot to cold. I was sweating my tail off for about half of the meal.   Food Quality/Taste = 4 Stars Portion Size Given Price = 4 Stars Price = 3 Stars Experience with Staff = 3 Stars Decor = 2 Stars Wait Time = 3 Stars\"\n",
      "A-OK in my book. 3.5 Yelps.   Four of us went for NYE dinner.  I believe I was one of 2 who enjoyed their meal thoroughly.  Know that it is a different kind of Italian.  Fresh and homemade but def different. Let me start by saying that the best dishes of the night were the apps.  They were awesome! Risotto balls and some sort of egg and cheese croquettes that the waiter recommended- great job.  Loved them.  As a group  we ordered the rabbit  which i thought was the best entree  the single strand spaghetti  the ravioli special  and the gnocchi.  The gnocchi aren't really potato gnocchi  but rather flat pasta.  Confused me as I guess we expected it to be shaped like an gnocchi.  Our meal was good though  Again I really liked the Rabbit.  The service was also good.  Not a bad stop  especially if your not looking for traditional gravy.\n",
      "Hands down one of the BEST restaurants I have ever been to! Last night I went for my 3rd time and it has just gotten better (which I didn't think was possible)! Freddie  the manager is so kind and welcoming. Our server AZ was awesome and so helpful with what to pick off the menu with both wine and food. You MUST try the Pecorino Agnolotti  an amazing dish that both my fiancé and I couldn't get enough of. The Scrippelle and Roast Pork ravioli were magnificent as well. I believe this place is one of the best and a must try for all my fellow foodies out there!\n",
      "Enjoyed our time here recently. We were greeted warmly and got a nice table by the window promptly.  Service. 5 STARS ABSOLUTELY this is how you Do service. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and drinks. Made suggestions and brought samples. Checked up on us and was a delight. I'd give her 10 stars if I could.   The boards are an absolute MUST.  Great beers and cocktails.  You really can't go wrong. The boards are up to you. Have all veg or all protein or mix it up.   Everything we had was well presented. We had a mix of proteins and veg. Only thing was everything was really over salted. Lacked any other spices or herbs. Pepper would  have been nice. Hence the 4 star.  I missed any hint of an acid or sweetness. The breads and roasted baguette pieces were definitely on point.  In hindsight I would have ordered a salad too.   Dessert. Disappointed that our first choice was sold out. As was our first choice in Beer. Sad.   Tasty cake was a novel attempt.  A little heavy on the peanut butter but fun nonetheless.  Cobbler was a nice ending and 5 stars for not being overly sickeningly sweet. Thank you for that!   All in all very enjoyable considering so many other eating establishments in the area are at solid 3 stars. For a reason!  We will definitely be back!\n",
      "Nice atmosphere  clean bathrooms and good strong drinks. We were only there for a short period of time but the cosmos definitely got us right before we were on our way. I didn't get the bartender's name but shout out to him & his heavy hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went here last Saturday with my girlfriend and my father  and I was absolutely blown away.   I'll start with the drinks. One of the owners is an old friend of ours  and when we inquired about the beers (all brewed on-site!!) he brought us a sample of his 5 favorites. They were all fantastic  but my favorite was the House of Bitterness  a delicious IPA. I would have been very happy with all of the beers I tried.   For food  we ordered a bunch of dishes and shared everything. In terms of highlights  the Hooked up Frites were just unbelievable. Brisket was very tender and flavorful.   The mushroom and spaetzle was perfect. The large charred oyster mushrooms were a perfectl complement to the soft spaetzle.   The chocolate chip cookies came out warm with the chocolate chips just beginning to melt.   I can definitely see this place becoming hugely popular. They have a great selection of house-made beers  delicious new-American comfort food  and a super cozy atmosphere. Can't wait to go back and try more things.\n",
      "Bar Hygge was an experience that didn't disappoint in any way...food  service  ambiance  and value.  Further  the restaurant has an expansive selection of craft beers and wines that pair extraordinarily well with the menu.  I look forward to returning again in the near future to sample additional items!\n",
      "Hey now  this is just what Fairmount Ave. needed. This place has a great ambiance and the staff were wonderful. We came in around 6pm on a Wednesday and were seated quickly. I started with an Aperol Spritz (draft) and it was tasty! I split the waffle (chicken) wings with Dining Partner and a buddy. I've had a rendition of these in Upstate NY and these were comparably delicious. I highly recommend them!  All three of us ordered the burgers  two of which were charred much past the medium well we ordered  but it's understandable because they're just starting out. The waiter and food runner (manager maybe?) we very attentive and constantly asked how we liked our food. After we paid our bill  they didn't rush us out in fact they invited us to stay and hang out. Can't wait to come back for more!\n",
      "Nice staff  good food  calm decor  decent prices. Not much more you can ask for. I will be back.\n",
      "This place is awesome. Love the cocktails and the beers. However  the wine on draft is my favorite. I also love everything on their menu. You can order whatever and it's amazing. I love the boards! I love two blocks from this place and I tell all my friends about it. Great service as well.\n",
      "I've been here twice now and I can honestly say that I wish I had a better experience. It's new to the area  which made it exciting.   Sadly  the beer list is mediocre and service is weird. I'd still come back  I guess but not any time soon.   The most important part is that the food is awful in quality and portion. We got the cheese/meat/veggie board. There was nothing on there that was worth the price we paid. The food was so mediocre and I had to rip at the meat because the slices weren't laid out well  just slumped. I'm sad to say that the food and price doesn't meet the expectations held.\n",
      "Great food  atmosphere and crowd! We had Hygge Boards as appetizer which included beer tartar & house smoked brisket - all very tasty and perfect for sharing among 4 ppl. I had Grass-fed Beef Burger - medium rare - was delicious  juicy and just the right size. Excellent beer selection - RunnerUp Belgium-style pale was great with my burger. We reached after 10 PM on Thursday night and stayed past their usual kitchen closing time but the staff was very accommodating and courteous.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was seated and then waited 20 minutes until a waiter finally came and asked me what I would like to drink. He apologized and he didn't know I had been waiting that long. Then 5 minutes later he comes back with nothing and asked if I would like to order my food. I told him I was still thirsty and have been waiting 25 minutes just for a drink. I gave him my dinner order and he finally filled my glass with water. After a few minutes my food did come out and it was very good. If not for the terrible service I would have been very pleased with it all. Then he asks if I would like desert and I declined. I was just ready to leave the restaurant. He brings me my check and I hand him a card. He asks \\would I like change?\\\". I tell him \\\"it's a card....\\\". He comes back with the check book  but there wasn't a receipt in it  just my card and the first original itemized receipt. So instead of waiting even longer to have him give me the receipt I have to write a tip on and sign. I state on the original recipes  \\\"no tip  since I wasn't given the right receipt.\\\" I signed it and was on my way. The food was great  but the service was terrible. I had never been here and was upset that this was my first take of it.\"\n",
      "On New Years Day we went to McCormick & Schmick's to celebrate our engagement (that morning at Love Park).  My future in-laws were in from Syracuse and after a long day of celebrating we wanted a good meal to end our amazing day.  I'm sad to say but our experience at M&S did the complete opposite and completely ruined our night.  Something was \\off\\\" about our waitress.  We ordered our food and waited over an hour for our food  when we asked what the hold on was... we were told that there was a party of 19 that ordered before us.  The waitress then came back and told us that they were out of lobster mashed potatoes and offered us the cheese potatoes with lobster on top  which we agreed on.  Our meals FINALLY came out and there were no mashed potatoes because now they were out all together (even though one plate did have mashed potatoes on them).  You can tell that the meals were sitting in the window for some time because our steaks were now over cooked and dry.  Not to mention that the juices on the plate were now dried up.  I went to the supervisor in charge and explained to her that I was in the business and never complain (I actually created an Yelp account to write this review).  I told her that I was just engaged that day and we were celebrating and we just weren't happy.  I explained about the filet  the wait  our waitress and her response back was \\\"well what would you like me to do?\\\"  I wanted to reply... \\\"I just want to walk out\\\" but I controlled myself.  The supervisor took off for one filet and sent us champagne  which none of us drank because at that point we were tired  hungry and just over M&S.  We actually went back to our hotel rooms and ordered cheeseburgers from room service that were way better then what M&S served us that night.    M&S could have been the cherry on our sundae ... instead we will always remember it as a big let down on such a big day in our lives.\"\n",
      "Been here twice - once alone  once with a co-worker. Big benefit is that it's around the corner from the hotel and I can just eat at the bar.  I've gotten the lobster ravioli and the ahi tuna. My co-worker got the scallops and the wedge salad. Both times  the food was great. I am a bigger fan of the ravioli than the tuna. They've got tons of choices on their menu.  Service - exceptional from the bartenders. They're friendly  but not overly so. And they check in on you an appropriate amount. Environment - I haven't been in there when it's busy  so it's been nice. I can see it getting crowded. It's also a bit dark  but you get used to it pretty quickly.  Background notes: dinner while traveling alone after working for 14 hours.\n",
      "Seafood was nicely prepared  tasted fresh. It seemed a little confusing  as the menu was more high end  but the bar and the ambiance seemed more similar to what one would expect from a pub. I like this place more as a pub  personally  despite the food being good. I had a mixed grill of seafood  which was tasty  and fairly well seasoned.\n",
      "If I could give this no stars I would.  My boyfriend and I went here in February 2009 after receiving a gift card.  If you want bad service and overpriced frozen food (with dirt) this is the place for you.  We called the restaurant and were told there were many vegetarian friendly options on the menu. This was untrue. My boyfriend's mussel appetizer had a ROCK in it. His linguini with clams contained a SHELL FULL OF SAND which made the entire dish gritty and inedible. My vegetarian stir fried vegetables with coconut rice was a bland mix of steamed celery  carrots and broccoli with plain white rice (no sauce) and absolutely no source of protein. Our flourless chocolate cake was frozen.   We complained after every bad dish was served  each time our server said \\sorry.\\\"  We were assured by our server that the bill would be corrected.  When the bill came  we were charged $21 for the \\\"vegetarian entree\\\" and also charged for the linguini with clams. The mussels had been removed from our bill. After sending the bill back we were still charged for some of the inedible dishes but the price of the veggie plate was corrected.  Terrible experience!\"\n",
      "Love this place for lunch and especially happy hour. Probably one of the best happy hour places around. The only downfall about lunch here is that there is quite a wait. It is pretty pricey  but the food is worth it. They also make the best mimosas with freshly squeezed oranges.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have long been fans of McCormick & Schmick's restaurants. Unfortunately  they closed the one near my parents' house  so we thought it might be a fun adventure to go into Center City and visit the one downtown. I love this location because it's right on the corner in the shadow of City Hall.  I have to say that the first impression here was not so great. I called ahead to make a reservation just in case. The gentleman who helped me talked to me while some kind of awful very unprofessional music was playing in the background. Then he put me on hold forever. Then he came back and the music was gone  so I don't know if he moved to a different phone. And then he seemed to have a lot of trouble actually taking my reservation. It should not have been that hard.  At any rate  we show up for said reservation and from there things did improve. Our waitress was very good. I ordered the clam chowder for the first time ever and was delighted to find that it is partly based on a very generous helping of bacon that makes it warm and decadent and a pretty darn good cup of soup. For lunch I had the crispy fish tacos  which were pretty good except for the incredible amount of raw onion. Since the whole taco is covered in sauce  it's tough to pick out pieces of excess onion. But other than that  the dish was decent. Others got shrimp scampi  which got good reviews  and a burger (a non-seafood lover in our group).  Others have said it  but it's not a cheap meal. Still it was OK for a treat. There is valet parking during dinner hours but not lunch. Parking in any of the nearly downtown parking decks will run you $10-$16 or so on a normal day. Just something to know if you are planning to park.\n",
      "Was in the city doing holiday stuff and stopped in M&S  not our first choice  but Ruth's Chris had close the nearby location  and car parked at Wannamkers.  We placed orders for drinks  one salad  one app  entree.  Salad and app came within a reasonable time  but drink took forever to come.  They either brought the wrong drink  or they honestly thought that an SoCo old fashioned should be served in a martini glass or didn't know how to make one (WTF?  Heard of Google?).  Sent that back  ordered another drink  which never came.  We were trying to flag down the server so that we could get water glasses filled  as app was spicey. Our server was no where to be found for 45 minutes.  We decided to leave  and we went to Morton's  which coincidentally  is owned by the same parent company (Landry) that M&S is.  We were chatting with our server and told her what happened at M&S.  She told us  that she  personally  sees about one customer a month who walks out of M&S and goes to Morton's (If this is what ONE person at ONE restaurant is noticing  I can only imagine the traffic that's heading into nearby restaurants like Capital Grill or Fogo de chao  etc).  She was telling us she took family there (she get's a discount as a Landry's employee) and had seen pretty much what everyone complaines about  both as a customer and as someone in foodservice industry.\n",

      "I am not a sandwich-lover  but Paesano's has made a believer out of me! I had the finest tuna sandwich I have ever eaten here and also have had the chickpea sandwich (the panelle). Both were the BEST I have ever had.   First off  I would like to thank the folks who designed this place for making it airy and roomy and not crowding it with too many tables. I love that the flow of traffic to the \\pickup\\\" counter does not impede on the table spaces of folks eating in. My one complaint is that there is no distinction in packaging for eating in and taking out - all sandwiches come in paper and all soups in paper cups - all disposable. I would love to see my eat-in sandwich displayed on a lovely plate  but I can live with this petty thing given the delectable food.   The tuna was awesome! It is Italian tuna and green olives with potato chips and a hint of pimiento cheese (I think!). The roasted tomatoes round it all out into just plain awesome. it is a rare and wonderful thing when the alchemy of a tuna sandwich can leave me puzzling as to the exact ingredients making this thing wonderful! It was literally the best tuna sandwich I have EVER eaten.   The Sicilian chickpea pancakes in the panelle are so light and air-fluffy that they remind me of Marc Vetri's spinach gnocchi food magic. This is  in short  a fantastic sandwich offering a combination of flavors that were just perfect! It has the savory and the slightly sweet and the hot and tangy all wrapped up in perfectly toasted flat bread. Yum!   Also  as other have mentioned  a great selection of hard-to-find sodas - my personal favorite is the Cherry Wishniak.\"\n",
      "it was good as-is  but if you want so called philly cheesestake  this is not the place to go though.  i remember how good the cheesestake that i ate in Philly 5 years ago was  so wanted to get another good one since we were near Philadelphia.  we chose this place based on yelp reviews. turned out the closest thing that i wanted to get was \\peasano\\\" on the menu. it had fried egg and different kind of cheese from a usual cheesestake. it was good! it is beef but the cheese and the sourness made it very light.   should have gotten a T shirt there !!\"\n",
      "visit on 8/20/2011  Soooooo good... Ordered an Arista sandwich - Whole Roasted Suckling Pig  Broccoli Rabe  Italian Long Hots & Sharp Provolone - and this was one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. The pork was a savory  tender  juicy pulled pork balanced out with a nice bitterness from the broccoli rabe. Italian hots gave the sandwich a little kick and the provolone held it all together. A well rounded sandwich with a lot of delicious flavors in each bite. This sandwich alone is incentive enough to bring me back to Philly!\n",
      "Daring sandwiches done to perfection. This review is going to be short and sweet because their is nothing bad to say. So I'll just say this.  Best. Sandwich. Shop. In. South. Philadelphia.  Stop reading this review  call them up  order yourself a Bolognese (lasagna with a fried egg on it WHAAAAAAA) and enjoy.\n",
      "Circumstances conspired to keep me away from Paesano's (no cash money  got lost  it was a Monday) but oh man  do I regret that missed time. Three of us went today during the crazy Italian festival that was going on outside (roads blocked off and everything) and we were still able to grab a seat with no trouble  and the sandwiches came out about 10 seconds after our friend arrived late. The soda fountain is awesomely old fashioned (orange cream soda and root beer  anyone?) and the sandwiches were uniformly delicious. I had the Diavlo  which  even though I was no longer hungry after half  was so good that I had to finish it. Our friend's eyes rolled up to the ceiling after trying the Arista. Even my vegetarian boyfriend was pleased with the Giardana. It's a bit of a hike  but totally worth it.\n",
      "It's hard to blow me away with a sandwich  but this place does it and they do it consistently.  I've been here several times but am finally getting around to reviewing it.    We stopped in around noon on a Sunday.  As expected  the small store was fairly crowded.  The line moved quickly and we placed our order and sat at the counter within 5 minutes.  We ordered the Paesano and the Daddywad.  The Paesano was great and I especially liked the horseradish mayo.  The Daddywad was also very good.  The sandwiches are big and won't leave you hungry.  The atmosphere is no frills.  Just typical deli counter seats.  With sandwiches that tasty the atmosphere doesn't matter.\n",

      "WOW.  I have eaten here before and always thought it was good.  The brisket sandwich has always been what my go-to here...but no more... went the other day and ordered the zaw-zeech (sausage) sandwich  and WOW just WOW is all I have to say.  The best sausage sandwich Ive had in a while  maybe ever...the GF got the Arista  also really goood... check this place out if you haven't.  Be careful though  bc you can easily walk right by it and not notice\n",
      "Good University City choice for decent South Asian buffet food.  Buffet has a good  albeit small selection.  Vegetarian choices are the best with the eggplant split pea dish and chickpeas my favorites.  Naan was a little hard and chewy  probably from sitting in the steam table too long  but the fried puffy dough triangles were wonderful.  Potato samosas were heavy and dense  but otherwise tasty.  The chicken dishes were flavorful  but the meat was universally dry  including the tandoori chicken.  All in all a nice respite from the sea of fast food near by and this one doesn't cost as much as the pricier Distrito and Bobby Flays.\n",
      "Not worth it if you're vegetarian. $13.95 for dinner buffet. Everything I tried was too salty (chana masala  Dal  saag paneer). Yogurt raita had sugar in it  tangent: perhaps a guju owns this place. Rice was thankfully good. Naan was awful  I couldn't eat it. For the quantity of salt in the food  water service was done right (pitcher at the table). You'll need that pitcher.\n",
      "Definitely my favorite Indian buffet in west philly. As another reviewer said  it's pretty consistent and has a good selection of vegan & vegetarian options  I especially love their paneers  spicy aloo gobi  and baigan bharta. Their green chutney and yogurt sauces are delicious  and they have great samosas. Free mango juice during dinner service is obviously a plus  too!   Life rules when it's a Gulab Jamun (the honey ball dessert) day at Sitar. I can't even.\n",
      "Their buffet is pretty good. Went there for the first time today. Variety of choices.  Good number of veg and non veg dishes. Samosas are amazing and the chutneys along with it makes them .   Wednesday's are better with cheap beer. Prices are very reasonable and great service.  I would prefer ekta over sitar but not at all bad for the value.  Would love to go again for lunch buffet.\n",
      "I must have been to a dozen Indian restaurants in this city and Sitar India isn't horrible and it isn't great. It's fine  just fine. Honestly  I have trouble recalling the differences between this place  Tandoor  and New Delhi. I think New Delhi does the best job in labeling what's vegan and what's not. Otherwise  all the University City Indian restaurants are about the same to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had the buffet and LOVED it  but IMO the best dish is the chicken kadai.  So sad to be moving a little further away from Sitar in the fall - it's my go to whenever I need a cheap  filling  delicious meal.\n",
      "Why order one entree when you have the choice of a dozen? Sitar offers  affordable buffets for lunch (~10$) and dinner (~$14) with an impressive offering of both veg and non-veg options in addition to salads and fixings (chutney  ichar  samosas) and dessert. Located smack-dab in University City  its always bustling. Therefore it might be warranted to make a reservation in advance.  Tips and tricks: 10% discount for students and 5% discount if you pay in cash. Also the waitstaff  assume you will be doing the buffet so just go grab a plate and head to the back of the store front to get started.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've never written a review on any site before but I'm bored right now so I will. I go here a lot because I live 2 blocks away. The food is the best Indian food on campus in my opinion  which might not mean much to some but I think it's really tasty. Negative reviewers were complaining that one shouldn't order off the menu  but I didn't even know you could to be honest. I just eat the buffet and especially at dinner time (when they have free mango juice and gulab jamun for dessert) I think it's really good.  Also for reference I'm actually Indian unlike most of the people reviewing this restaurant.\n",
      "Hands down best Italian BYOB.  My husband and I don't get out much these days with 2 little ones  but B.K. (before kids) we were real foodies  spoiled by all of Philly's great food.  Food is terrific and well-priced. Love  love  love the antipasta.  I can still taste it. Not the usual meats  cheese  olives  but delicious marinated vegetables of all kinds. Each has a unique flavor.   All vegetables  love it  and I'm not vegetarian or normally fond of cauliflower.   And who doesn't want to get called \\Bella\\\" by a waiter with a genuine Italian accent? Can't beat it.\"\n",
      "Food is delicious  service is great. I will definitely come back to the place. I really have nothing to add  so if yelp could stop trying to force me to write more that would be greatly appreciated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Def the most authentic best italian restaurant in philly. This small byob has the best italian food i've actually had in philly. You need a reservation though because it's small and people all the way from new jersey drive in to eat here. I hope it stays a south philly secret. It's also right at the edge of Girard Estates area of philly which is the nicest safest area in the city. Def try the fried gnocchi. It. Is. Insane. Good.\n",
      "Delicious and authentic. The atmosphere is definitely old school italian  intimate and basic. The food was delicious and the service was great. they accomodate all requests and all their choices of homemade pastas are definitely a favorite. Great meal in this homey BYOB. we'll be back.\n",
      "Came for dinner with my girlfriend before going to the Andrea Bocelli concert at the WFCenter since the restaurant is not very far from the venue. The location  the atmosphere  the service and most importantly  the food  made this place absolutely the best dining experience we have had. We considered it better than any similar restaurants we have been to in New York or Italy. The location is just off of Broad in South Philly and parking was no problem on the street . It is small  and once one passes the front kitchen/pizza section  two charming little rooms contain small tables set up cosily.It feels one is in a small neighborhood restaurant in Italy. The waiters were very attentive and without asking they divided my girlfriend's and my dishes on separate plates after overhearing that we were talking about trying each other's dishes. We were very impressed by this! The food was simply the best we have ever had  the grilled calamari and the shrimp appetizer were out of this world. The gnocci with mushrooms and the duck were also exeptional. The desserts were also fantastic. The tab of approx $85 was very reasonable for what we had. Now i want to bring back my entire family so they can also experience this exceptional place.\n",
      "I came here for my birthday with a group of 23 people. Sadly we couldn't all fit on one table so we ended up splitting into 2 group  which was unfortunately but there was nothing they could do about it. It's BYOB  service is excellent and food is seriously so delicious. For someone who has to serve 23 obnoxious people  our waiter was so patience with us. He open our wines immediately  brought us our glasses and told us to be as loud as we went to once the couple next to us leaves (it was almost time to close).  Even though we made reservations  we did end up waiting almost an hour to get seated  but then again  I can't blame them because we were a huge group. Def will go back again soon.\n",
      "I have read that thi restaurant is perfect for a first date  Well it is definitely true! The re is a lot of specials  and the food is just delicious. I had for the asparagus and shrimp in a sort of basalmic sauce which blended perfectly. For the entree I had the lanb which was absolutely amazing! The atmosphere is really intimate and the service is great (a little hard to understand the italian accent!). Had a great time !\n",
      "I can't believe I never reviewed L'Angolo (translates roughly as \\The Corner\\\"...fitting as it is on a corner).  The place is tiny  you walk through the kitchen to get to the ultra cramped tables  surrounded by mismatched  Italian artwork and photos.  Still the food is better than most Italian in the city and the prices are insane.  You'll leave for under $30 a person in most situations!     The pasta is generally very good  the meats can be hit or miss.  It's pretty authentic and  for the price  a relative steal.  Grab a solid bottle of Chianti or Dolcetto and rock this joint.  PS. Like in any South Philly area  parking can be a nightmare.\"\n",

      "We were in Philly for the 2013 NCAA LAX Championships  and needed a quick and good breakfast before the games. The Penrose diner exceeding our expectations for breakfast. The coffee was good and never ending  the service was quick and the various omelets and egg sandwiches we had were great. For diner breakfast  this is as good as it gets.\n",
      "This is definitely The One - my diner of choice in South Philly.  It's my opinion that you can really tell the quality of a diner by its lunch and dinner offerings  not breakfast.  Breakfast is difficult (though not impossible) to screw up.  My friend and I came late one Saturday night  around 12:30 am.  The hostess and waitress were cheerful and attentive.  The facilities are updated and clean.  My friend ordered breakfast  I decided to break from tradition and order a sandwich.  They got all my additions and subtractions from the sandwich right the first time  AND it was delicious.  I wanted to eat all of it  but got too full due to the plentiful portion.  Fries were crispy and flavorful.  Refills of drinks were prompt.  This is the closest I've come so far to duplicating a true Jersey diner experience.  Score one for Penrose.  Now  if they can do matzoh ball soup  they'll have me for life.\n",
      "Once again  my sisters and I enjoyed a post-flight- into- Philadelphia lunch at the Penrose last week. Service was excellent and our food tasted great. I ordered one of the lunch specials that included dessert. Of course  I chose rice pudding  which completed my meal in the best way possible! Will be back next time I fly into Philadelphia to visit family!\n",
      "Agree with everyone who raves about the French Onion soup. I'll put it up against any 5 star restaurant. It is a must have when I go there. Their salads are also nice.  I like the new look decor.\n",
      "Great place for breakfast before an event at any of the stadiums. We had breakfast on a Monday morning at 10:00am on Memorial Day. Parking lot was crowded but if your patient spaces come up fast due to the quick turn over inside. The line was out the door and down the walkway  which made us question staying. The line moved very quick and we were seated within 5 minutes  so don't leave even if the line looks long. You could also walk in to check for counter seating which is FCFS. Once inside the diner is huge  very clean and updated. Waitress greeted us immediately a provided great service. Huge menu with many great options. Food was great and served fast  especially based on how crowded the place was.   You pay at the counter. Try the scrapple if your not from Philly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Got dinner here twice recently and was pretty satisfied. Long menu and the food was cooked well. If you like liver and onions  they have huge portions of perfectly cooked liver  onions  and bacon. I am much happier with their dinner food than breakfast. Nice to see everyone happy and pleasant waitresses.\n",
      "Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place. I'm a regular.  About 20-25 years ago  it was a disgusting pit with horrible food.  Then they re-modeled (I wonder if ownership changed  too?) and has been great ever since.  Obviously  a diner has to excel at breakfast.  Check.  To get five stars from me for non-breakfast times  the food has to be good at other times  too.  That's where the Penrose surprises me.  Their dinners aren't just decent for a diner -- they are actually good. Consistently so.    The service ranges from average to outstanding -- never bad.   When I think \\What do I need from a diner?\\\"  the Penrose comes to mind.  It's better than any of the other South Philly options -- tried 'em all.  If you want to beat them for breakfast  you'll have to visit my neck of the woods (suburbs)  and you'll pay a lot more (and the service won't be better).  You won't beat them for dinner at a diner up my way  and you'll pay a lot more for your dinner.\"\n",
      "My friends and I come here... Often  and late. Features of this diner that some other Philly diners lack:  Semi-secluded back room for us queer folk* Friendly service Ample parking Delicious dessert variety Cheese whiz.    * note: this is where we like to sit. I am not saying they put us there for any negative reason. Just to clarify.\n",
      "The only reason I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star rating  is because of one single pretentious waiter. As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar  the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay  I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived  the host staff were busy and not available  so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy  so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat  before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply  and in an irritated/in-convinced tone  told me \\I guess it would be fine\\\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off  and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short  he was distant and we both got the \\\"couldn't be bothered\\\" vibe from him. When it came to the bill  we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies  and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced.   Although that situation left a bad taste in our mouth  and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant  we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring \\\"last nights waiter\\\" wasn't on shift  we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly  the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day  recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey  described how to make classic cocktails  and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind  funny  friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before.  I also ordered room service last night from this restaurant  and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience.\"\n",
      "was here twice -- first for a nightcap at the bar -- the drinks really were some good stuff and i tried a the lemon hummus and pita -- that was the best hummus ive ever had!  the next morning we came in for brunch  which was pretty much terrible. first of all  it took us 45 minutes to get our food for brunch....and it came out cold and we found a hair. the manager did comp our check though. overall  the bar is great  but i would skip breakfast. what a disappointment for a kimpton restaurant.\n",
      "Square 1682 is a hotel bar I frequent. I've been there for lunch  brunch  dinner and happy hour. The food is great  the service is excellent  and the space is upscale. There is always a nice group of people that go there. Whether they are staying at the hotel or live or work in the area  you'll always find someone nice to chat with at the bar. The very best thing about the bar is the bartender that works on Mondays. His name is Dan and he is the man! He's my favorite bartender in the city and I've been to a lot of places. He always knows just what I want and remembers my name when I go there. The only reason I go to Square 1682 on Monday's is because Dan is working. If I walk by and he's not on  I keep going. He's that good! Love him and have so many great memories at this fine establishment.\n",
      "The hubs and I met here last night for drinks per the suggestion of our yelper peers.  The atmosphere was fantastic. The bartenders were nice  the hostesses took our coats immeadiately and it wasn't as pretentious as they'd like you to believe it is. I love the columns of gold links on either side of the bar. I commented to my husband that I wanted a bracelet that looked like the links.  We stayed for two drinks and left fairly drunk. Hubs had two old fashioneds which were out of this world (and Im not usually a brown liquor kind of girl) and I had the grapefruit vesper: Gin  Ruby Red Absolut and Lillet. It was amazing. The bartenders were very attentive and nice  doing the rounds to make sure that we didn't have an empty glass and chatting about how the drinks tasted  etc.  I will probably go back here...but the prices were kind of high. $46 for four drinks...eek  xo\n",
      "On this most-recent visit to Square 1682  we noticed the menu changed  removing my main draw to the restaurant: the black bean burger. The falafel sandwich that took its place was served on a rather hard bun  rather than traditional pita  which smushed the falafel as you ate and generally overwhelmed the flavors of the tzatziki sauce. (There are plenty of delicious falafel spots in the area that quite simply do it better.)  The drop in rating comes from the \\Express Lunch\\\" taking 45 minutes to get to the table (we had 8 people  most of whom ordered the Express Lunch  assuming it would be quicker than the regular menu). 45 minutes is not express and not at all useful when lunching on a time limit. It would've been nice if the server had noted that because Express Lunches are served all 3 courses together  they do not come out as prepared (they're held under a heating lamp till all pieces are ready) and therefore it might be faster for a large group to order off the regular menu. We saw other groups (including some of our colleagues) come and go in the time it took for us to get our food.  I still like the space  as it's quieter than many restaurants  so you can hear one another more easily  but this latest experience took a hit on my recommending it for future meals. A tiny peeve: the \\\"giant cookie\\\" was regular-sized (small?) and fine  for oatmeal raisin.\"\n",
      "Phenomenal brunch experience. The poached eggs on buttermilk biscuits and pork confit was delightful and just the right size. The service was impeccable-- friendly and watchful. My orange juice and water were regularly filled! They had live jazz during weekend brunch  and the restaurant is beautiful and cozy.  While the menu is small and can be uncreative  the food is high quality and decently priced for Rittenhouse Square ($12 for the above mentioned plate and $3 for OJ).   All in all  a good experience.\n",
      "If you get nothing else on the menu  you must try the bacon wrapped dates.  They are savory with just a touch of sweet and snuggled into a yummy sauce with finely chopped roasted red peppers on the side.  Every bite was gorgeous.  I also had the butternut squash soup  which was very tasty and large enough to be filling on its own.  Then  I also added in some deviled eggs.  They were good  but spicier than I would have thought.  What made them spectacular was the little bit of crispy duck skin on top.  It made the whole dish come together.  We also sent our waitress back no less than 4 times to answer questions about the menu  and she was always happy to check for us.\n",
      "Happen upon this location in search of a post New Year Eve breakfast.  Even w o reservations we were seated almost immediately. Party of 4 ordered pancakes  eggs and frittata all which were good  problem was the service. Two in our party received their food the other two did not. Nothing worse than half the table getting their food while the others have to wait!!!  Folks w o food say \\ go ahead  don't wait\\\". In my opinion this is just about the worst thing a restaurant could do to a guest.  Despite the food being good the type of service we received during our visit caused us to have a poor dining experience.  Unfortunately we left the location vowing never to return.  Please 1682 work on this issue  it's important and has a huge impact on the customer experience. Food get 4 stars  service gets 1.\"\n",
      "** REVIEW BASED ON BAR ONLY **  The feel of this trendy spot is very posh  but works well and has a great energy to it. The prices are reasonable  and the beer selection although not extensive  is very well selected. (A trend of Kimpton hotel restaurants).   The problem for me was the service. Although upon being flagged  the staff was friendly and proficient  there was very little initiative. There needs to be a happy medium of attentiveness  but not too the point where annoyance or over-bearing takes effect.  The truffle popcorn was good  but the butter wasn't very well distributed. Each small handful had a different taste. The pork confit quesadillas were very impressive  and were accompanied with a smokey chipotle dipper that really maximized the taste of the confit.\n",
      "If you're into the trendy places you'll really like this. However if you're just looking for a good meal and not to brag about what you ate the next day to everyone  you should probably take a pass.  I think the menu must have changed dramatically because it does not match some of the other reviews. I went for lunch but they accidently left me with a dinner menu and there was no \\beer and a burger\\\" kind of options.   This place is very trendy and nice but requires a very exquisite palette for enjoyment. The lunch menu I was presented with had one option which I was interested in and that was the People's Choice Cheesesteak.  The sandwhich was small but very tasty and they did overload me with some home made chips. It cost me about $11.  Personally when I think of the \\\"American (New)\\\" catagory I think of crazy out of this menu items that you may want to try. But also remixes of old classics as well. Like you do something amazing with Tomato Soup or a Cheeseburger with Free Range beef and some spices I've never heard of from an island I didn't know existed. I can't really fault them for that  but if what I ate was any kind of indication of the quality of the food  the price does not match the portion and quality.\"\n",
      "I'm always glad when a new place opens up in the neighborhood. I've only been here once and it was post-9pm on a Saturday night. A solidly good experience.  The service was great and attentive. Beers were always refilled immediately  and the server was helpful in our selections. My food was just okay- I had the \\sausage and smash\\\" and it didn't blow me away  but the menu is so extensive that I will return to try more items- including beers. I drank whatever the Belgian special was  and it was great.  Really glad that they came to Chestnut Hill  and I look forward to their open dining when the weather is warm.\"\n",
      "Beer. The right kind of beer. Food. The right kind of food. Service. The right kind of service. It amazes me that I found a place like this that I love to this degree.  There are plenty of decent restaurants in the Chestnut Hill/ Mt. Airy/ Manayunk regions.... but man I love this place. The Vienna Red Lager is my stand by at this point but there are A LOT of good beers. The right kinds of beers. The food is impeccable.  Somewhat surprising for a brewery.  Not that brewery's don't sometimes have delicious treats... but full menus  most of the items being a wonderland to the palate. It is a bit pricey... but man  is it worth it. In a world full of greasy dives that just don't deliver that old world charm of warmth and good service... this place astounds me. Go here if you haven't been yet. Go back if you have.\n",
      "It is our favorite place to get good beers. However the service can be hit or miss. Unless you seat at the bar.   We sure do enjoy their regular and seasonal beers and burgers. I wish they have an outdoor seating area during the warm season.\n",
      "\n",
      "Waiter Mike P. just taught us ALL about beer! He's amazing... he explained all the samples  asked us about our thoughts  made suggestions  explained the fermentation process... and he advised us on the food menu... we had lovely beers and a fantastic meal.\n",
      "After searching far and wide for a restaurant that was open on Memorial Day  we stumbled on Iron Hill.  We had been wanting to eat here since it opened and were excited to finally try it out.  The dining room and bar area was packed  but we quickly found a high top in the \\seat yourself\\\" area.    The beer/drinks and food menu are both expansive.  The beers are always excellent and varied.  The food menu includes all your standards(bar apps  burgers and salads) and some very delicious sounding entrees.  We went with the Goat Cheese and Artichoke Dip for an appetizer. They didn't skimp on the pita  which is a restaurant pet peeve of ours.  For our entrees we both ordered large salads.  The Salmon salad was well put together with just enough heavy ingrediants.  The mesculan salad was light and full of delicious pistachios and dried cherries.  Altogether an excellent meal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Come here on the reg with friends to get in house beers and nachos. Once in a while get actual food  but the nachos are so huge we are usually full after that and two or three beers. All the waitstaff I've had here was decent  one guy was awesome but unfortunately I can't remember his name. Will continue to come here  love the Chestnut Hill area as a whole.\n",
      "The food was delicious  I had the pretzels as an appetizer absolutely amazing and the crab cake sandwich was delicious as well.  Our waiter Edward was absolutely phenomenal  such a great guy.  5 stars highly recommend.\n",
      "Excellent  excellent  excellent.  Amazing menu - it was just endless.  The prices were such that they could accomodate any sized budget.  The service was amazing.  The food was hot and delicious!   I will be coming back very soon!!\n",
      "Good food & drinks! Cool atmosphere  chill vibe. Bar tenders could have been more attentive.\n",
      "I've been to the upstairs for shows more than I've been downstairs. Large beer selection. Attentive bartenders. If they over sell upstairs you're packing in like sardines. And even with all the windows open  on a hot summer night you can roast up there when it's crowded. Good sound system.  Have had a meatball sammie downstairs  nice touch with the long hots. Food prices are on par with the neighborhood. Downstairs is much brighter and more refined.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service here was some of the worst I've ever seen. We sat at our table for twenty minutes before she brought us menus and took our drink order  and after she brought out our drinks (my drink was wrong) we had to flag her down half an hour later just to order food. She then disappeared for the last half hour  so we ended up having to go up to the bar to ask for our check.  If the food were good I'd be willing to give Milkboy another chance  but my meal was just ok.\n",
      "\n",
      "First I would like to mention how impeccable the service was. My serve  who I can't remember his name unfortunately  was very attentive and came back serval times to make sure I was pleased with my food.   The reason I gave it three stars was because I ordered a cheeseburger and cheese fries and wasn't really pleased by the taste. Burger was tasteless  like they took it out the box and fried it... no seasoning or anything. I guess the fries were okay seeing as though it was just cut up potatoes not French fries.   My food came out in a very reasonable time so I was happy with that. I would recommend this place just order something else.\n",
      "Went here with friends. Service was phenomenal. Got the bbq wings and Korean bbq sandwich. The wings were pretty good  but the sauce was very light in terms of flavor. The sandwich was okay  not too sure if it went together  but i don't like warm kimchi in anything other than soup. I love their fries though! Overall  food was okay  but the service and atmosphere was awesome!\n",
      "Looks cool  and it's in a walkable spot  but didn't appreciate the vibe of the staff. Controlling bouncer that apparently kicked people out for no reason on a unique event night. Music was interesting and on point but the clientele was very interactive like I'd hope at a bar.   Small shot glasses  but somewhat a cheap city wide if you're in need of one.\n",

      "This was the first time i've been to Milkboy. I have to say  I really enjoyed the ambiance. The server was very friendly and quick to get and refill our drinks. The food was delicious  I got the Burrito  It was really good. I was reallly liking the place...until I went into the bathroom. The Bathroom is disgusting  The bathroom was full of flies  I mean like TOTALLY full of flies and the toilet didn't have a lid. it was a piece of wood that had grafitti all over it and didn't even cover the tank. I don't know if they think thats trendy or what. I was completely grossed out. If you cant keep your bathroom clean  I wonder about the quality of the kitchen.\n",
      "Really terrific food. As others have mentioned it has simple decor and is one of the few places in the US that actually reminded me of walking into a family run restaurant in SE Asia. Food is terrific - $8 plates. Uur group tried pretty much everything - and it was all outstanding and felt home-cooked. The chicken curry  goat  and fish were particularly good. Can't go wrong here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chicken Satay was really good  but nothing to scream about. It was very tender and well marinated. You can taste the flavorful seasonings in every bite. (5 stars)  The Sambal had a good kick of spiciness. I can actually taste the shrimp from the sauce. The chicken and lamb I had were ok. I can have the same taste everywhere else. Nothing special. (3 stars probably)  The place takes order like fast food restaurant (you go there  pick your foods then pay at the counter).  I think the food is pricey. The foods were served on styrofoam plate with plastic fork and knife  so it had cheap feeling to it. A plate with 2 choices of meat with rice did cost me $10  and there were not much meat served.   P/S: We ordered Satay with other rice dishes  and we waited forever for the Satay to come. We finished all the foods and nothing. They actually charged us and forgot to make it  so we waited for a long time. I don't know what they use for seasonings. The foods were not salty  but I felt extreme thirsty after the meal. For my personal experience  that means too much MSG. However  nothing is sure here.\n",
      "Stopped by this place yesterday with my hubby. The food was great. Loved it. But  they have increased their price. The veg. options are 7 dollars and the meat options are 8 dollars. But definitely worth it!\n",
      "Small but clean - that is the most important part of the eating experience. The woman helping us was so sweet and very helpful. I got the fried fish  eggplant  and tempeh (I have no self-control  I need to try as much stuff as possible. They load up the plate with tons of rice. These dishes are pretty much homemade and the spices you will taste are unlike anything you have ever tasted before. We tried to find out what exactly it was but she said its a secret. That's fine  I'll keep coming back for more secrets.\n",
      "Super authentic and fantastically tasty food. The family who run the place are extremely sweet. Great for take out or bring some beers  sit on the rolling chairs and eat off the styrofoam plates.\n",
      "one of my favorite pastimes is to hit as many restaurants as is possible in one evening  and last night i planned a three stop dinner expedition (the bare flourescent tube circuit)  which ended in some slight disappointment.   the night was to begin with satay  then move to fattouch salad and falafel and end with an al pastor cemita. unfortunately bitar's was closed. however  the perfectly cooked and deliciously sauced lamb and chicken satay skewers tends to take the edge off of a lot of forms of pain.   the restaurant is the pure distillation of the concept of \\the hole in wall\\\". the space is tiny. you'll probably be watching a movie from the 80's with the other eaters as well as owners. its really an extension of their living room: going over for some home cooked food  a hug and a loud shout goodbye. its THAT warm feeling on a cold philly night.  the satay is the best in philly. better than the fully respectable indonesia restaurant  and light years better than the standard sticks at the banana leaf.  the \\\"three item combo\\\" plate is solid  but less exciting for me. i've also had the soto ayam which is good  but for me its all about the satay.  (in case you're interested  the last stop was to Los Taquitos de Puebla where i wanted to try an al pastor cemita -normally i'd get a milanesa but  i wanted to test out their pastor. what i ate hardly resembled a torta let alone a cemita. the wrong bread  no panela or quesillo cheese  no peppers  no salsa roja  the appearance of pineapple and cilantro) the the al pastor was average - at least by LA standards. i guess if you want a pork sandwich and are not thinking about what a cemita is supposed to taste like  it would be fine. this also was 7 bux where it would cost 4 in LA.\"\n",
      "We came by and got a to go container.  Lots of great choices.  I got the beef rendang and the Ikan (fish).  It costs just 10 bucks and comes with rice.  The beef rendang was tender and the fish had great flavor.    The hot sauce that you can get is absolutely amazing.  So delicious and adds so much flavor to the dish.  I wish I could have that bottled.    There's a reason why the chefs here were nominated for a James Beard award!\n",
      "Just  so fucking good. So many veg options  GET THE COLLARDS NO MATTER WHAT  and meat eaters will b very happy  too. Such sweet Angels!\n",
      "Food is very affordable and delicious.  I have never had Indonesian cuisine before and wanted to try something different.  I was absolutely blown away.  I loved how you can add spicy red chili sauce to your plate.  It adds a nice kick.    Try their fish curry and collard greens.  A must!  You will not be disappointed.\n",
      "I was really looking forward to trying out Birra tonight since I heard such great things about their craft pizza. Unfortunately  my dining experience wasn't what I expected... Nonetheless though  the food was truly good.  Pros: -- Amazing choices of funky pizzas. My friend and I order the Truffle White Pie pizza -- absolutely phenomenal! They place a sunny side up egg in the middle of the pie and it was heavenly... I want an egg on all my pizzas now -- Versatile beer selection -- Friendly staff  Cons: -- I felt more as though I was at a sports bar than at a restaurant... The bar itself takes up what seems like half the first floor. The group of people sitting at the bar behind me were extremely loud and using an excessive amount of profanity in their conversation. One of the drinking patrons was just standing in the foot traffic area right behind me  which caused people to push up against me when walking behind my seat. At one point  I felt one of the waitresses' drink trays right on top of my head! -- Noise level gets really loud and it becomes a bit hard to hear people sitting across the table -- Sweet & Spicy Calamari was lacking in expectations... I doubt I would order it again  I definitely would come back again in the future to try it out when it's less crowded!\n",
      "\n",
      "Great Beer list  as promised. Salad was solid  and pizza delicious for small  personal pies. But the BEST part is that there is weekday happy hour where you can get one of those little pizzas for $3 and a beer for $2. Can't really beat that with a stick.\n",
      "Some of the best pizza in Philly by my standards: hand stretched crust that's crispy outside and soft inside  plenty of cheese  quality toppings. Nice indoor & outdoor dining spaces  quick & friendly service  excellent craft draft & bottle lists  solid wine list & some cocktails. Both traditional and unique pizzas. The spinach & artichoke and the pear & Gruyere are both AMAZING. The beet salad was too sweet for my taste.\n",
      "I love that this place has happy hour until 7:00pm and they have great happy hour specials: $4 pizzas  $5 sangria/ magarita and beers!   The food was delicious  wait staff was great  and the atmosphere/ location of the restaurant   Order the honey pot/jar!! It is ricotta and honey with pistachios sprinkled on top and bread sticks to dip into all that deliciousness.... Love at first bite!  Up next were 3 pizzas: red sauce and mushroom  white pizza with truffle oil  and red wine sauce stuffed crust pizza with meatballs.   The mushroom pizza was my favorite with truffle oil white pizza following closely behind. I didn't like the stuffed crust pizza at all. I don't know if it was the sauce or everything together but one bite of that was enough for me.   It's not the best pizza but it's not the worst either. It's good enough for me to come back again and again though. I'd recommend eating the pizza while it's hot. Otherwise it'll become hard. With 7 people sharing 3 pies  each having 3 slices  we were stuffed!! There was about 4 slices left.   Drinks were small and not that strong.\n",
      "Birra has a great happy hour deal with a beer and a pizza for only $5. The service was very friendly  and my waitress was quite knowledgable about beer. I sat outside since the weather was great  but I wouldn't recommend it. The table I chose was right next to the Septa bus 29 stop  and every few minutes  a smelly bus drove by while loud people continued to congregate at the street corner. Once rush hour ended  dinner resumed to normal  but next time  I'll remember to get a table indoors. I can't wait to try this place again.\n",
      "Food is good  service is abysmal.  Mussels used to be great  now they are flavorless.  Pizza is still good.  I truly felt like I was disturbing the bartender by asking for anything.  The pounding gangsta rap was offensive.\n",
      "This place is great but I really just want to write this review for their AMAZING seared artichokes. Hands down  best artichoke I have ever had. I crave them every other day. Fresh chokes  seared on the grill with a delicious lemon garlic aioli. I can't rave enough. SO GOOD!!!! You get 2 whole artichokes  sliced in half (4 pieces). It is enough for a full meal. Please never take them off the menu!\n",
      "I really enjoy Birra. The food is great and it's consistent. The Happy Hour is one of the best around with $5 pizzas and discounted wine and drafts. My only complaint about this place is WHAT IS UP WITH THE BARTENDER??? I took notice to the bartender with ZERO personality back in probably September. He was a new face behind the bar once LaScala took over. Not for nothing  BUT this is your job and you can at least PRETEND to like what you're doing.  This guy never greets you. He throws down the menus and walks away without even asking you if you want to order a drink. You'd think he'd be trying to push the $6 happy hour drinks  instead I had to ask for one every time I ordered or flag him down because his back is always turned away from you. Aside from that this guy ALWAYS DISAPPEARS! Where does he go..? Probably on his 3rd smoke break  who knows?!  All the other servers and the hostess are all super sweet and totally attentive as you should be working in a busy restaurant. As I was about to pay my check Mr. Bartender Man is again nowhere to be found so I asked another server within my view if I could have my check. I was told I could have it when he came back. When is that??! Where did he go..?? Bartender came back after about 7 minutes and continues to talk to other staff on the other side of the bar. HELLO. Can I have my check? He jumps back behind the bar and never comes near my side of the bar. I literally have the credit card out on the bar in plain view to *hint*hint* I'm ready to pay. Perhaps this guy really isn't cut out for this industry. Birra  please...You're delicious and I want to come back but when I see this guy behind the bar from the window I'm going to make it a point to avoid coming in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food was good and so was service. The only issue we had was that all of our food wasn't brought out at the same time but they did comp us free dessert and apologized about this. Overall  pretty good.\n",
      "\n",
      "We came here for a birthday dinner. The burgers were good  3 stars because of the pricing and menu options. Your best bet is to grab a burger  everything else seemed overpriced. Our service was good and the server was helpful. The Guinness Jameson bacon cheese burger was very good and we're glad the waiter recommended it. They also have a free birthday ice cream which was a nice surprise  most places don't do that anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very nice. Good food  the service was excellent. A little pricy  but that was expected.\n",

      "What a disaster!!  My first time there in 2005  I thought the place was great. Food was great  staff was great. Well  Apparently things change. Apparently O'bama thinks things change..and we all know how that went. Anyway  Enough of the political disasters. Time for this restaurant disaster. My brother and I went to the HRC after much thought and boy did we pay the price. We started by walking in and promptly being seated. Which..was great. Smiling faces..friendly greetings..the works. THEN  It all goes to the spicehole (cant curse for some reason) :+)..from here. We ordered our food at about 6:30 pm. We waited a total of  1 hour for our food to be brought out. Heres the kicker @ 7:30 pm..They brought the food to the wrong table and after I got up and told the food server that the food was ours he looked at me and ignored me. We knew it was ours because the people looke at the waiter mysteriously and the guy that was eating our food...even said to his wife \\hun  I think this is their food\\\".  So  the people were eating our food. At 8:00pm..We were still waiting for our food to be brought out by the waiter and then found out..the waiter never put the order for new food to come to us. WE told the waiter what happened. So  My brother and I decided screw this..were outta here. We offered to pay for our drinks which the waiter declined and stated that the food was coming. We werent buying it..So we left at about 8:06 pm. I know that the place itself deserves better than one star. But deffintely not the service. It was by far the most horrible service I have had in quite sometime. Oh yes  by the way  We ordered mac&cheese with chicken..and a burger with fries. We totaled it up... counting taxes..came to 35.00 (estimate). 15.99 for mine..and 10.99 for his.. Horrible Horrible service.\"\n",
      "This was an awful experience.  Did not clean up the tables  no service  had to hunt someone down to get an order placed and to top it off appears as though they provided food for a homeless man ( great and I support the kindness but he smelled so bad and set beside us). We are paying patrons.\n",
      "Horrible horrible horrible service. Cold food. Extremely long wait for food. Steak under cooked  Salmon burnt Bacon missing from bacon cheese burger No condiments.  Watered down long island ice tea. First and last time ever visiting  Save your money.\n",
      "Terrible. While in line made a reservation online for an hour later just in case. The host & hostess weren't on the phone or assisting anyone. The line kept growing. We finally got up to the counter and they said stand over here. Then people kept coming in and they would wait and then be seated. Not with reservations either and same table size. 45 minutes later I ask about it and they couldn't have cared less. Terrible service. There were plenty of open tables too that remained empty the entire time. If we weren't so hungry I would've demanded a manager.... instead we had some decent sandwiches instead of the over priced frozen stuff we would've had there anyway. I am a great tipper and as hungry as we were I already had appetizers and was planning on the ribeye  a $35 plate. Their loss.\n",
      "Very very poor service..made reservations and upon arrival was told they can not seat us until everyone from our party was there (they were stuck in traffic)..so we sat at the very tiny bar that's at the door and the bartender looked to be inexperienced..sat there for 10 minutes and never looked at us..I asked for a drink and he told me to hold on that he's busy cutting limes..finally got our seats and waited for 32 minutes for our waitress to acknowledge us..and that was after I had asked if we had a waitress..they have 10 tables tops in the restaurant and the service was just horrible..finally after 2 hours we left..maybe this place is ok during the day during the week   but not on the weekend\n",
      "YES!  This authentic mexican restaurant sprouted up in our neighborhood all but two months ago...and I'm elated!  I'm always craving good mexican food in Philly and we happily surprised to find and enjoy this place.  A Los Catrines Tequila's spin-off  this seems to have a more low-key \\taqueria\\\" take on Mexican food.  Las Bugambilias is located right next to South Street Diner and offers a warm  intimate setting.  The seating is somewhat crowded  but it actually had a good effect: our neighboring party gave us recommendations for the special appetizer of mushroom and cheeses quesadillas and the skirt steak entree.  It's certainly close quarters  but I'm glad they have so many tables packed in there  as we were seated immediately on a Friday night!    The ambiance allows for a friendly encounter among all.  The staff are very attentive and know the menu well.  I had the three chicken enchiladas con mole  which was hearty and filling.  The complimentary chips and two salsas are authentic and delicious.  I definitely will return to try some of their specialty cocktail drinks  chocolate tres leches cake  and the tortilla soup.  The menu has a selection of seafood  pork  beef and chicken dishes and offers detailed explanations of each entree.  Definitely get the guacamole!  As far as service goes: I happened to forget a personal belonging behind after leaving and the bartender caught up with me 2 blocks away to return it to me on a cold winter night without his coat!  I'm very impressed!  Las Bugambilias did not disappoint.  I intend to return again and again.  Hours: Tues-Thurs  Sun 4pm-10pm   Fri-Sat 4pm-11pm\"\n",
      "Great food  but everything else was mediocre.   We decided to come here for our anniversary  hoping that it would be a nice restaurant with excellent food. I made reservations three weeks ago  but we had to wait 15 min. for a table when we arrived. They sat us at the bar  but didn't offer us a drink for 10 minutes. Eventually  we were seated at a very small table. We literally had to climb over other clients to get there. It's a very  very cramped restaurant. Luckily  the acoustics are good  so it isn't overwhelmingly loud  even though it's a lot of people in a small room.  SERVICE: Like I said  we had to wait for our table  even with a reservation. I had even confirmed this reservation earlier in the day. Additionally  we weren't offered drinks for a long time. I think our waitress forgot about us a few times  because we didn't get refills on our drinks until we asked for them.  FOOD: I am a vegetarian  and there were plenty of options for me. I chose the Vegetarian Enchiladas. They were the best I've ever had. There was an amazing poblano cream sauce and the black beans were amazing. The chips & salsa were good (but small)  but the salsa was extremely spicy. I love spicy food  but the salsa rojo was too-hot-to-handle for me.   DRINK: I am a huge margarita fan and I thought this was decent  but not great. 6/10  PRICE: I thought that the food was decently priced for being such high quality with fresh ingredients. My enchiladas were $15  for example. The margarita  however  was $9. This was too expensive for the quality of the drink I received. Additionally  we didn't order the guacamole because we heard the portion size was too small for the price ($9.5).\n",
      "Great food  horrible service.   Their enchiladas and mole are great. Their seafood and meat plates are tasty. Their salsa  guac  and chips are delicious  too.   Note though  they don't give you much chips  but if you want a refill  you will be charged. You can just see the hesitation on their face when you ask for more  and it's a huge turn-off.  And sometimes  they don't tell you there's an extra charge. Seriously  does it kill your overhead for more chips?  In general  their demeanor seems to be like  \\We make good food  and people love us. Therefore  it is your loss if you don't like it here.\\\" This may be harsh  but I've felt this multiple times I was there.  I do think their food is good  but the feeling I get from the staff prevents me from going more frequently.\"\n",
      "The decor was my favorite part of this experience. Classic Mexican colors and designs filled the small docs.   Queso Funtido starter was unique  made with shrimp and crabmeat. My chicken dish was filled with Mexican flavors and accompanied by rice  beans  and guacamole. I had the x-rated margarita  which tasted like a spiked pink lemonade.   Service was standard and friendly.   The prices were a bit high for the experience and location  but definitely a nice find in a city without a lot of Mexican restaurants. No problem getting a table at 930p on a Friday.\n",
      "This place is so cute -- It's small  quaint and I love the decor.  Service was good -- she was sweet  friendly but only somewhat helpful with helping us choose the tequila for our margarita (thus the 4 vs 5 star rating). The $9 classic margarita is described as \\ with the tequila of your choice\\\". I asked for Don Julio which they didn't have -- so I asked for her suggestion which she was mumbling along.. and then asked if we wanted Patron silver  totally fine. But lack of service comes here -- she did not let us know it would be $13 a piece instead of $9 as described in the menu. This place would have gotten a lower rating on this alone  except the food was pretty phenomenal.   They start you off with homemade chips  mild salsa (pico de gallo) and a rojo spicy salsa. Pice de gallo was simple  chopped up tomatoes  cilanto  a bit of salt and onions. The spicy one was a bit more flavorful and to my favor  We got the vegetarian tamale -- which was delicious and perfect. Highly recommended for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike  I got the Enchiladas del Mar -- smothered in a red creamy almond sauce  filled with lobster  crab and shrimp. This dish was overall a 5 star. Fresh seafood  good flavor to the sauce  a small side of rice as well as salad to help cut down the richness of the enchilada.   My partner got the fish tacos which were done really well -- good guac   and lightly battered fish which is a must.  Great little Mexican spot on south street  tasted truly authentic. But keep in mind  this meal was $75 pre-tip so be ready for that!\"\n",
      "Came here on a visit to Philadelphia.  Neat little place in a  neat neighborhood.  Cool decor and atmosphere.  Also  it is tiny and cozy.  The food is presented well and colorful.  The tamales were great and the hot chocolate was excellent.  We also ordered a cheesy queso appetizer that was just ok for us and one more entree item that I cannot remember  but it was not memorable.  So it was 50 50 for us.  Based on one experience  probably difficult to rate  but this was our first impression.\n",
      "Las Bugambilias is a great place to go for quality Mexican food and a lovely homely decor.  It's decorated so nicely that I often feel like I\\ve been transported away from the craziness of South Street and into Mexico.  They start you off with some tortilla chips and salsa.  It's fresh and yummy but I do wish they would give you more chips esp if you order the guacamole as an appetizer.  I also like ordering the nachos de la frontera!  I've tried a few entrees and for the most part  they have been really delicious.  The chile rellenos  enchiladas verde  & the poultry dishes are always great choices.  However  their seafood dishes that I've had have never been good -- I do not recommend ordering seafood from them!      Overall  good service  cheerful decor  & great food - minus the seafood!\"\n",
      "I look at this place and it's just slightly below the threshold of \\over the top\\\". I'm not sure why certain venues serving ethnic foods find the need to go overboard into cliche like levels of decor. I'm glad they pushed they envelope but then had a little restraint. Regardless though  I think the Mexican decor movement has been tired for 20 years and actually brings the experience down for casual diners. Why not go modern ala their counterparts 100 miles NE (Pampano  Rosa).  Also there's a difference between \\\"good\\\" domestic Mexican cuisine and \\\"authentic\\\" Mexican cuisine. If a place like this was serving \\\"authentic\\\" regional Mexican then most people in the Philly area would be upset at the spice  dishes they're unaccustomed to  and that \\\"mole\\\" is not the \\\"mole\\\" they've been having. See Mexico City for authentic cuisine (or Oaxaca region).\"\n",
      "Best Mexican food I've had  everything was extremely fresh. We went when it was packed so the service was a little slow  but the waitress apologized and even gave us some delicious complimentary flan for desert. We'll definitely be back in the future.\n",
      "This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever dealt with. From beginning to end the service could not have been any worse. When we walked into the door the hostess did not seem to want to be bothered with any of the customers. I had asked for a table to seat 13 people and was told the wait would be about an hour. After about 35 minutes of waiting  my party and I noticed that the hostess had walked out of the restaurant. A customer had asked us if we were waiting to be seated and we replied \\yes \\\" he then informed us that the restaurant had been struggling that night and that he waited over 30 minutes for a to go order. We were then seated after about an hour and a half wait  but when we arrived at our table there were only 11 seats and even those were crammed together. We asked management if we could have another table added to the two that were already pushed together and the staff made it seem as though it was too difficult of a task to be done  so we began to move the tables ourselves until finally one of the employees saw and politely moved them for us. The hostess we had  who never mentioned her name throughout the entire meal  had the worst customer service I have ever seen. She asked if we would like drinks but only took drink orders for 5 of the guests. When asked about one of the drinks on the menu  the waitress seemed clueless. After we finished our appetizers  our meals began to come out  but our waitress did not take any of our finished dishes from the table in order to make room. After our meals  our waitress did not even ask if we would like to have any left overs wrapped to go or if we would like dessert  even after two guests ordered cheesecake. Throughout the entire dinner  my party  as well as myself  did not have a good time and we all agreed that we will not be attending this location ever again.\"\n",
      "Worst place long wait for a meal  then came uncooked wet chicken. Turned it back waited an other 30 min for the check. Disappointed ! And it was at 3:30 pm not even rush hour yet\n",
      "i love cheesecake factory--food's not gourmet but the ambiance is fun so it makes up for it. i've been to at least 10 different locations in various states and this one is by far the worst of them all. nothing ruins an experience more than poor service. horrible service.  we were seated pretty quickly on a Saturday afternoon  but no one came to our table for the next 10-15 minutes--not even to give us water. when they came to take our drink order  it took another 10-15 minutes for them to bring it to us--the place wasn't packed and there were servers all over the place and ours was nowhere to be found. a different server came over to bring a beer and then our actual server finally came with my iced tea and 1 water even though there were 2 of us. we were sure to order the app and entree at the same time since it was apparent it would take awhile. the appetizer came at a normal speed--after taking 2 bites   a completely different server came with the entree--great timing and communication. as were finishing up the meal--i'm still taking bites from the plate the server came back and asked if we were done...ok  i guess so. we then ordered a cheesecake to-go--she came back with the check and 15 minutes later the cheesecake came from yet another server. how many people does it take to serve 2 people? And how long? I know it just opened  but it was really disappointing to say the least.\n",
      "So this was my second experience with The Cheesecake Factory in Philadelphia and honestly might be my last. My first time going was wonderful. Food and service was great and well worth the price  but this time was nothing compared to my first visit. My waiter was so rude. I tried to give him a break because he seemed tired and it was 9pm but the times after that was a no go.   Examples : made me feel rushed to order  very passive aggressive  took my appetizer away even though I wasn't done with it  asked if the tip was \\all of it\\\".   And it honestly just wasn't the waiter/service  the food has noticeably gone down in size since my first visit. The food was very bland. Just the worst dinner ever.\"\n",
      "Will not eat at this location again. Started with them telling us an hour wait. So we put in our name and came back 55mins later. At that point they said we were one of the next tables. Well 30 mins later we will were not called. We went up to complain and were told they were cleaning our table. 15 mins later we finally got seated. Total wait time was 1 HR 40 mins which is pretty ridiculous considering that when we got seated there were 4 large clean empty tables around us.   The server was prompt and polite. I had no problems with him. We put our order in immediately with our drink orders. We got our bread and it was not warm and was very hard on the outside. When the runners brought out our entrees they only brought 2 of the 5 out. 5 mins later (yes I actually monitored the time) the other 3 entrees came out. 2 of the entrees were wrong. My husband ordered spaghetti and received a sandwich and I ordered a burger and received a piece of meat on hard bread  nothing else was on the burger. I told the waiter and he apologized. I told the waiter to take back my incorrect food and that I did not want my food replaced so just take it off the bill which he did. They brought my husbands correct entree  but at that point everyone else at the table was already done.   By the end we were annoyed and just ordered the strawberry shortcake to share. The ice cream was good but the biscuit was very hard and inedible.   Definitely will not be returning!!\n",
      "My third visit and you can sense the slow decline in what was pretty good service and quite good food (for the $) after only just under a month open.    Now the \\downstairs\\\" hostess is busy  busy on her cell phone and the \\\"upstairs\\\" desk staff is busy  busy looking bored  disinterested and talking among themselves.  The server staff is trying but management is  at best  focused on...who knows what...not the customers for sure.  Seated at the tiniest  most crowded table in a half empty restaurant--I guess this was convenient for...the staff. When I asked for new table the manager was nearly dumbfounded and reluctantly reseated us after asking if we had ordered anything--I guess if we had ordered we would be punished by not being allowed to switch tables. (Actually our server finally took initiative and moved us since the manager was busy...talking with the hostesses.)  Food arrived at a reasonable pace and was C+---beef in Hibachi Beef was dryish but other items good. Tried to buy a piece of cheesecake (at almost $10 a pop) and couldn't get anybody to sell it to me. 1 counterperson--3 customers---all on a very slow night overall---while 2 hostesses and 2 mangers stood right next to cheesecake case chatting with each other.  They hustled for the first few weeks--now they're just taking orders for pretty good food with diminishing service. Bottom line--almost faithful (local Center City eat-out-all-the-time nearby residents) are now twice a year customers...maybe...locals who wouldn't send visiting friends and relatives here for sure...  As other reviewers have said...it could've been a hit but it's really just hit...and miss at CCF!\"\n",

      "Take-out only review.  One of my friends was in from out of town and was craving cheesecake. We walked a couple blocks over  took the elevator upstairs and were greeted by a hangry mob.  Well  basically. It was midday on a Saturday and this place was bursting at the seams with people waiting for tables. Originally we planned to eat-in until we heard about the crazy wait time. No thanks.  Fortunately  they do have a to-go counter. While the process of ordering was a bit unorganized and the staff unfriendly  we were able to snag our cheesecake slices and leave within about 10 minutes.  I ordered the chocolate chip cookie dough  and it was pretty darn good. I don't want to consider the calorie count on that thing...but if you're in the mood for an extra sweet snack  you could very well visit this accessible spot.  Of course  there's also the option of stopping in one of the local haunts  where you're likely to find stellar fare at better prices. But that's just the anti-chain snob in me speaking!\n",
      "\n",
      "The service is awful at times and other times its superb. Not sure why this is so  but I have been there quite a few times. The food isn't out of this world. They do so many different cuisines because their menu is vast  but there isn't a single dish I am crazy for. However  they have amazing appetizers. Love their stuffed mushrooms  flatbreads  lettuce wraps  etc. It is for their appetizers they get a 4 instead of a 3.\n",
      "The food  while over-priced for takeout  is very good. I love the food  but usually get indian food or something similar elsewhere because it's more affordable. Two vegetarian platters will cost you about $28. It's not really a place that you want to sit and eat dinner because it's small and not very atmospheric. I will definitely go here again when I get a craving for Ethiopian food  but it would be nicer if the food was better priced OR the atmosphere was better for a dine-in experience.\n",
      "I was just here on 3/19/2011 with a large group. We called ahead of time and the owners were very nice and accommodating. They gave us the whole upstairs for a surprise party. And were friendly squeezing past us to bring food and take orders. And he kept checking on us to make sure we had everything we need.  I do suggest sharing food since you get a lot.  The food is good and they have a lot of variety. I would have probably liked my beef cooked a little longer  but everything is tender. They give you lots of Enjera (bread) to eat it with. It's BYOB so your party can bring their own wine and they will give you glasses.  The dessert is great!! I wasn't sure if I wanted a cake (chocolate cake) for the surprise party so I didn't order one  but he made one anyway - and good thing because we decided to get it. It was very tasty.  It's a block north on 20th street from 20th and Walnut. Parking is available on the street  and if you go before the club hoppers come out you can probably get a nice spot.\n",
      "Service = 4 Cleanliness = 3 Food = 3.5 Value = 4  (DISCLAIMER: My standard for Ethiopian food is the Blue Nile in Ferndale  Michigan. I have yet to meet a restaurant that can come near it in quality. My bar is high!!)  The restaurant is cozy and the layout is odd. Not great for big parties. It looks a bit run down which is OK for a \\hole in the wall\\\" vibe.  The service was fine but slow. I'm not sure why since the place was empty the whole time we were there.  The bathroom is tiny. The door does not close all the way. Because you use your hands to eat  it's important that they're clean. I didn't get that feeling because you have to touch so many surfaces just to navigate the bathroom. Hand sanitizer! (The Blue Nile brings wash cloths to your table.)  We ordered the vegetable sampler + chicken tips. The food was just OK to us. It was great to have Ethiopian but we have had better in terms of flavor and freshness. We took some home but didn't eat leftovers.  This was our 1st try. My hubs is a 3-try proponent so we may be back when we're in town.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Friendly staff  and good food.  Not amazing  but good and at a fair price.  I came here for the Ethiopian food  so I can't comment on the coffee shop aspect.\n",
      "Don't let the atmosphere  or lack of  deter you. The service of the owner chef is welcoming and friendly and the food is well done and tasty!\n",
      "I love this place :-) Delicious food  very friendly  little hole in the wall. Meat is tender  not over cooked or dried out  spices are awesome. I also got a butterscotch shake  very good  not over sweet.\n",
      "A true gem for vegetarians -- and their omnivorous companions -- in Rittenhouse Square!   Almaz is like a chameleon.  They serve up serious Turkish coffee during the morning commute  American style wraps for the working lunch crowd  and deliver an authentic menu of Ethiopian delights for those in-the-know.  I'm not an expert on Ethiopian cuisine  but I am always extremely satisfied with Almaz's vegetarian sampler platter.  The dish has a beautiful array of colors  and the portion size is enough for two meals.  The injera is tangy and chewy with enough holes to sop up all the juices of your meal.    The dine-in space is tiny and the second floor dining area presents some accessibility issues  but if you're lucky enough to snag a seat you're in for a treat.  Friendly owners and staff will help guide you through the menu if you're unfamiliar with Ethiopian food.  Perfect for a solo night out  or a gab fest with your besties.  I always appreciate the atmosphere here -- the smaller space feels intimate and is perfect for catching up with friends.\n",

      "Normally I enjoy this restaurant. Not last night. The wait staff was terrible. I had to chase down my server to get one refill  and again to pay the check. They ran out of the special brew I was drinking  and she was not helpful in recommending a replacement. Our clean dishes were manhandled  and not held by the rims. The noise level was so high that I could not hear the person next to me.  The pizza was OK  but not good enough to overcome the bad experience. I will not be returning anytime soon. Too bad  I love this section of Mt. Airy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was so glad to find this place upon relocating from South Philly to Mt. Airy.  I was in need of a new neighborhood pub with good beer on draft  a nice standard menu for dinner  and a few food specials on rotation to keep things interesting for regular visits.  Earth Bread satisfied all of these requirements.  At this point  my favorite standard menu items are the wissahickon or the caveman pizza  my favorite special is the Brussels sprout salad  and I am loving the honey latte stout.  I also really liked the earth bread brewery scotch ale  but I only had the opportunity to enjoy it during my first visit to this restaurant. The pizza is wonderful  wood fired  deliciousness.  This also makes for wonderful roasted brussels sprouts for the brussels sprout salad.  The general vibe is laid back and casual.  I enjoy bumping into my new neighbors each time I visit this spot and I always leave happy with my overall experience.  The service can be a little slow sometimes  especially if you visit on a really busy night  but it is never anything too terrible. Just put in your drink order asap so that you can be patient while enjoying your tasty beer.\n",
      "Not sure where to start but I love this place. The flatbreads(pizzas) are delicious! I've tried all of them and I've never had one I didn't like. They make their own beer and I really like a few of the ones I've tried. Some are not so hot but they also have outside beers and great wine by the glass bottle if you want that instead. Really kid friendly and Bernard (our server most nights) is the man! Always on top of things.\n",
      "I love the food!   I love the house made sodas!!  I LOVE the decor and the menus inside old books!   Should be a 5/5 review right?  Wrong.  For some reason  I often feel judged inside Earth.  I have caught the owner (or is she just manager?) rolling her eyes in my direction and then generally being unpleasant and rude or condescending toward me.  I enjoy being a generous tipper  having worked multiple years in the service industry.   I love the food there.    If I didnt feel like I was getting the evil eye from some staff (not all!) for whatever reason  I would be in here more often.  In fact  I would probably eat dinner inside or get a flatbread pie for take-out once per week.   As it is  I probably only dare order take-out once per month  and I haven't been upstairs to eat more than 2-3x per year since I moved to the neighborhood.  I want to love you Earth Bread + Brewery...but...\n",
      "\n",
      "Earth Bread has become a go-to spot for me when I'm in Mt. Airy.  The service is friendly and the flatbread is delicious.  Some other reviewers have commented on the owner/manager.   I don't recall ever interacting with her personally but the hostess and wait staff are always nice.  If you come on a Friday or Saturday night you might have a bit of a wait.  Fear not!  There are two bars  downstairs and upstairs  that feature their house-brewed beer as well as a decent selection of regional craft beers.  If it's too crowded (which it may be)  simply walk down the block and grab a beer at McMenamin's to kill some time.  I generally stick with the traditional flatbread.  A large is big enough for 2-3 people.  They also have salads and other appetizers.  If you have room for dessert  the sweet flatbread is delicious with chocolate and various fruits.\n",
      "This place is a great local hang out and also a nice place for date night or just to grab a good bite to eat. As far as food goes  the first time I went I had the spinach curry with bread appetizer just to fill my stomach while drinking and it was killer and cheap! The next time I had the Continental flatbread and holy crap that was great. Also I think I got the small not the large as there were two sizes and I had plenty to take home and make another meal out of. This is all good enough but then you gotta talk about the beer! I don't drink anymore but I'm glad I drank here when I did! Their house brewed beers are awesome and very unique. I tried all of them and they were all great in their own respect. The triple trouble was my favorite. But to top it all off: kick the keg Tuesday. $2 12 oz draft all night on whichever house brew they choose. And once the keg is kicked....bring on the next one. It doesn't end. Let me say I had some fun times here on Tuesday nights. Even the time this young dude stood there and listened to me bitch for THIRTY MINUTES about the fight I was in with my girlfriend...or maybe it just seemed like forever. Good kid. If you're out there  thanks buddy!\n",
      "Definitely my go to spot in Mt Airy at any time of day. Every time a pleasant experience. The decor is earthy and modern  trendy.  I would say this establishment is also very family friendly. I have 2 very active little boys. I did see other families with young children here at various times. The staff is nice  overall accommodating and friendly even when it gets very busy and it does get busy.  The wait for food can be long but once it comes you might overlook it. I typically get the Seed flatbread. Original and very tasty. It's easy to get full. Large portions can probably feed 2-3 people.  Naturally  beer goes well with flatbread and they have a nice selection of craft beers.\n",
      "i love this place...the flatbread is always sooooo good and the ceasar salad is a great appetizer to split....it's pretty generous.  favorite flatbread so far is the hunter...the turkey sausage is awesome.\n",
      "5 stars for the cannoli's  2.5 - 4 for everything else.  These are probably the best cannoli's I've ever had  or at least top two.  The chocolate chip ricotta filling is creamy and rich  and they squeeze it out in front of you  so the shell doesn't get soggy. It's really heavy though so I suggest sharing. ($4 for 1)  Other stuff: Their tiramisu isn't great. The entire thing is just pretty dry and bland (I don't think they soak their lady fingers in espresso). The cheesecakes are pretty good but not the best I've ever had. German almond cookies are good.   Just get the cannoli.\n",
      "I chose Termini Bros Bakery for my first dessert experience at Reading Terminal Market  and I'm so glad that I did. Surprisingly  it was one of the few bakeries still open during the time I went (around 5:30 PM).  This bakery has a wide spread of cakes  mini cakes  cheesecakes  and more. All the cakes were beautiful  and my friend ordered a Tiramisu cake and had some birthday customization done  the final product looked great. We sampled some pound cake  which was absolutely delicious and moist and soft. After sampling  I knew I had to pick up something from the bakery.  I wanted something small but something sweet  so I decided to choose between the cheesecake slices. At $4 a slice  they had the following flavors: pumpkin  marble and plain (New York). I ended up going for the marble (I'm a chocolate lover at heart  even though I did momentarily pause to consider the seasonal pumpkin flavor).   The cheesecake was so  so good. Perfect texture and consistency  just cheese-like enough to ACTUALLY feel like cheesecake. With hints of vanilla and chocolate  each bite was sweet. I finished the whole slice and wanted more. It wasn't too sweet for me or too rich for me which I also really liked. The temperature of the cheesecake slice  which is also really important to me in evaluating my desserts (especially cheesecake)  was on point-- I like mine slightly cold so that the cheesecake doesn't taste too soft or mushy.   I definitely will be back here to sample more of their desserts. Service was also excellent  and the women working behind the counter took the time to explain all of the different flavors  etc. Great experience overall and I definitely recommend getting something to satisfy your sweet cravings here while at Reading Terminal Market!\n",
      "Competitor for the best pastries in South Philadelphia. Their ricotta cannoli are excellent  and so are their rum babas. The decor is perfect: they even have a small band playing on weekends and holidays. And there is even a parking lot. Cannot recommend enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh how I used to love Termini's! My family has been going here for years before I was ever even thought of. I have always held them as my favorite bakery until I recently came here and picked up some pastries. First off their prices are astronomical. For 3 cannoli  3 sfogliatelle  and 2 rum baba it was $32. The rum baba tasted like dry dough covered in sugar water. The sfogliatelle also seemed drier and just not as tasty as I remember. I am disappointed the quality is going down and the prices seem to keep going up. After years of being a loyal customer  I am sorry to say but it seems time to move on.\n",
      "Termini Brother's bakery (in the Terminal Market) has a cannoli so good it will make you want to kidnap the not so friendly Italian lady behind the counter and force her to make you those orgasms topped with powdered sugar everyday. We got the sweet ricotta one with mini chocolate chips and a sprinkle of powered sugar. Did I mention they were beyond delicious? I also ordered a large  juicy chocolate covered strawberry. The strawberry was super fresh and only a dollar. The cannoli was $3  we split it and it was the best three bucks I spent all day. I don't know who the Termini Brother's are but they could move to DC and live with my mother for free  yelpers put the word out.\n",
      "I've only ever had a cheese cannoli here because I go there so rarely that I can't not get one.    It's the best.  Like almost sex good.  Need I say more?  Oh yeah  I think I had biscotti there once when I was really young and while vague  I'm pretty sure it rocked.\n",
      "Disappointed----Termini Brothers--- is not a real 'Old World' Italian bakery they portray to be.  Yes  their desserts are somewhat good  but I felt they lack flavor & authenticity.   On their www they claim how loyal they are to their family's 80 year old recipes.....Hmmmm  didn't know they use Trans Fats in 1921!!..... Some will roll your eyes and say \\who cares when it comes to a cannoli!\\\"... Calories aside  if I am going to splurge  I want to eat real  quality ingredients  not some crappy chemicals & hydrolyzed fat that is use to triple its shelf life!\"\n",
      "Let me begin by saying me and my sister will travel for food...and we have.  We have traveled the country  as well as outside the country.  Termini Bros. ranks as one of the best.  Surprisingly  when I tell people about Termini Bros.  I don't talk about the great desserts first.  The best thing about Termini Bros. is the customer service.  The women were very attentive  knowledgeable  and friendly  I believe their names were Alissa and Aliya.  Aliya took us for tour.    Now to the dessert.  Me and my sister were on our South Philly food run and parked in front of Termini Bros.  We accessed Yelp  read some reviews and decided to stop in before we went to Cosmi's Deli (which was great too).  We ordered a slice of rum cake  a white cupcake  all of the cannolis flavors  and a mini carrot cake.  Alissa gave us a free slice of chocolate chip cake.  Our favorite was the mini carrot cake and second was the chocolate chip cake.  On our next South Philly food run we will definitely go get a mini carrot cake to eat after our Cosmi's sandwiches:-).\n",
      "Hands-down the most amazing cannoli that you'll ever have!  Add Termani Brothers to your foodie bucket list.  The shell has an amazing crispness and the filling has a smooth flavor that goes on for miles without being too sweet.  I personally recommend the traditional chocolate chip variety  but they do have vanilla or chocolate available too.  I have them listed as \\My Last Meal On Earth\\\" in my Yelp profile for a reason!  )  If you are taking visitors around the city or a visitor yourself then you should know that this location is within walking distance of Pat's & Gino's.  Go there for lunch and come here for dessert!\"\n",

      "It was to my genuine surprise to discover that a sports bar exists in Chinatown  thanks to the NBA finals!   I wanted to write this review mostly to note that this place served some of the best sweet potato fries I think I've ever had (which is saying a lot because I'm Korean and Koreans make mean sweet potato everythings). Some friends and I came here to watch Game 3  and it was then that I discovered those deliciously addictive sweet potato fries. To add the cherry on top  it was only $3 off their late night happy hour menu (ka-chinnggg!).   Everything else about BarLy was just okay in my opinion  but to reiterate  their sweet potato fries really blew me away :)\n",
      "\n",
      "Interesting place... A little bit of a personality disorder  though. It's kind of a sports bar but kind of Asian restaurant and then kind of an Asian pub. Good beer selection. The Nutella creme brûlée was pretty great.\n",
      "New fav sports bar. Good food  great tvs  late night happy hour.   Mediocre service is what put a small damper on this place.\n",

      "One of the worst experiences we have had.they might have 60 beers  but after 45 minutes of waiting for a hamburger and a ham sandwich and just water  we walked out.  The services was terrible. Never to return again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Near place  nice size and convenient location. My friend and I just enjoyed drinks but others seemed to be enjoying their food. Staff is very friendly and knowledgable  especially of their beer selection. Mixed drinks are a little smaller than average.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is not much to say about Joes or \\Chinks\\\" if your a long time local. It is a little more expensive than other local cheesesteaks  but you know what your paying for. The meat is much higher quality than most places. I have had plenty of Philly cheesesteaks. Genos  Pats  Tony Luke's  Jim's....... still prefer joes over any of those.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chink's is probably not the BEST cheese steak I've ever eaten (and I have eaten THOUSANDS) but it is certainly in the top five of all time.   It is unique  somewhere between the Steve's (whole flat slice) and Jim's (chopped to death) presentation.  It works REALLY well  texture-wise.  Liscio's rolls were fresh and shiny  and the Wacky Wednesday deal of a large for six bucks was fortuitous. They usually have SOME kind of deal going though.. Meat was tasty and not gristly  the white American cheese melted like a dream (but short of the sauce that Steve's is.)  I got more meat than my son did  but both were acceptable portions.  Fried onions were 1/4 inch cubes  and caramelized beautifully.   Crinkle cut fries only get so good  but these were pipjng hot  and the Whiz that came on the side worked great on the sammy as well.  Lots of people on Yelp complained about the Whiz  but I could see it along with American as a great combo.Whiz is what Whiz is.  Possibly the REAL best thing here is the 1949 vibe.  This place is a time capsule  where only the prices have changed (and pretty minimally at that) over five decades.  Everything (including real fountain sodas) are made to order. Milkshakes (the half and half was very popular)  were killer.   Waitstaff is attentive and friendly as you are likely to find on the East Coast.  The accents tell you you re not in Kansas  but the hospitality is sans atty-tude.  It really does transport you to another era    We got there 12:30 and were lucky to snag the last open booth.  Full of regulars  with good reason.  Parking is not easy  but there are plenty of side streets  keeping the walk down to an easy block or so.  It was well-worth the 20 minute ride from the Main Line to make this pilgrimage  and it certainly won't be a \\one-and-done\\\" experience.  I usually find some reason or other to venture up route 1 every month or so  and when I do  this will certainly be a set waypoint on my GPS.\"\n",
      "I'm sorry if you're offended and I can see your point  but damn this a good cheesesteak!   My thoughts are all over the place with the little details I love about this place  so let me try to focus on the sandwich and go from there. The menu is pretty tight with how you can get your steak here. There is no whiz (thank god) and the Pizza steak  Steak Hoagie  etc...where not listed (although they do serve hoagies  so maybe if asked nicely you could get one if that's your thing). Next thing to know is that they don't disguise their meat by chopping it up into fine little bits. This is sliced baby  and it is good. The real stand outs for me were the most amazing roll and the fantastic sauteed onions. Both components are easily the best I've yet to have in my travels around the city and made for a delicious gooey mess by the end of the roll.  The place itself has a great vibe. It is tiny and I can imagine fills up during those prime times. Its 5 cozy booths with individual jukeboxes surround a little soda fountain! The place was staffed today with 4 (including the cook) twenty-something girls who rocked the place. They were having fun and totally added to the uniqueness of the place.  Steve's Prince of Steaks has been my favorite for a while  but Chink's has taken over thanks to the equally as good cheesesteak and the better than average atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went here when it was Chink's and the food was very good though the placed looked dated (something I actually like  though I know most don't.)  I have not been here deliberately since they changed the name to Joe's. I refuse to support those who buckle to political correctness.\n",
      "The best cheesesteak I've had in philly. There are a lot of things I love about this place. The 50's diner vibe  the ridiculous milkshakes and egg creams  the name  and of course the steaks. They are cooked to order  not an assembly line deal like Jim's or Pat's. This of course means they can give a lot more attention to the steak and it shows. The onions are perfectly caramelized  the flavorful steak chopped just enough  the roll is fresh and toasty  crisp on the outside and soft on the inside  and if you get american or provolone the cheese is actually melted properly and MIXED IN WITH THE MEAT  something that is crucial in my opinion if you are not going with wiz yet also something that is so often overlooked. The large steak is a full 12 inches I believe  and starts at just under 8 dollars which is already a great value. But Chinks has one more trick up their sleeve  their daily specials  which run from combo deals tuesday and thursday  to 6.50 large cheeseteaks all day on wednesdays  which is an incredible deal. Do yourselves the favor it is well worth the drive  especially considering it is a restaurant you can actually relax in  much different than the wait in long line get in n get out of certain OTHER \\famous\\\" places.\"\n",
      "The best cheese steak in Philly. Maybe the best cheese steak period. Anytime I even pass remotely by during a drive from Albany NY  I stop or make the detour to joes. Everything else there is also high quality. Clean inside and the service has always been good. If you want the best cheese steak  this is the only place you should go.\n",
      "First cheesesteak I've ever had  and though it was good it wasn't as amazing as I had anticipated. Nevertheless the place gets high points for the wonderful girls working there. They were all friendly!\n",
      "I walk by here every day but had not been inside until this weekend. I was impressed with the service as well as the quality of the food.   It was a little on the pricier side for what I would consider good (not great) Italian food.   Overall the meal was enjoyable and I would go certainly go back. BYO is always a plus.\n",
      "Been here twice  will definitely go again.  once went for a date  and sat outside. when it began to rain the server asked if we would like to move inside but we decided to stay and enjoy the weather (we were safely tucked under an awning). i had the arrabiata sauce  which in my opinion was the best i've had in a loooooong time. and believe me  i am a red sauce connoisseur! he had the chicken marsala  which is pretty much his staple order at italian spots  so it's also safe to say he is a good judge on that dish. we both enjoyed our meals very much and couldn't believe we'd never heard much about the place.  solely to once again taste that delicious sauce  i (selfishly?) recommended La Fontana for a group of friends looking to celebrate a birthday. we ended up inside in the back with 11 people in an 8 person space. not terrible though  as it seemed like there were several other large parties taking up the other bigger table arrangements. all in all  we enjoyed ourselves  the meals  and the 3 bottles of wine we brought. the servers gave us ample space to eat all the courses. no one fussed while we took 100 pictures  or changed our minds three times about dessert. after we left  i realized i left my ID on the table (let's blame the wine  shall we?) and called back to see if they could find it. the foreign  male servers were happy to meet me halfway down the block to give it back  and i only endured a couple creepy glances as i walked away.\n",
      "We held a surprise party at La Fontana last Saturday night for my mom's Birthday.   La Fontana has always been a family favorite and great go-to spot. Food is delicious  BYOB's are always great and the location can't be beat. Needless to say as great as the food is the opposite can be said about the staff. They are rude  very pushy and have never been pleasant to deal with. We hosted a party for 26  and I had coordinated everything with someone over the phone. Not to long after we got my mom to the restaurant and she was still saying her hello's one of the waiters approached me and said that we needed to order because they had another party coming in at 8. Much to my chagrin  I responded with \\we just got here  can you please let us greet our guests before you start making us order?!\\\"    From the minute our butts hit the seats they were forcing us to order. Like I said above the food is great and our guests were enjoying what they had ordered. By 7:30 we were singing happy birthday to my mom and cutting the cake  everyone was enjoying themselves  the company and their wine or coffee. About 20 minutes later a couple of the waiters came up the stairs jackets in tow. They had proceeded to say that we needed to leave (yes  just like that) we were being herded out of the restaurant literally. I looked at my dad with a very puzzled look on my face and said \\\"it isn't our fault that they booked another party on the heals of ours.\\\" But there we were 10 minutes later all 26 of us standing outside the restaurant with dumbfounded looks on our faces.   As great as the food is at La Fontana I think my family and I decided this was the last time we would frequent this restaurant. There are a million and one other great BYOB Italian restaurants in and around Philadelphia that don't treat their patrons like cattle.  For those who have never been to La Fontana be warned  you will have a great meal  but you will be rushed the entire time.\"\n",
      "I'd give this place zero stars if I could.    I agreed to go here for New Year's Eve despite the fact I'd been here twice before and been completely unimpressed.  My friends wanted to go to a BYO  we ruled out places with prix fixe menus  and we needed a res for a party for 8  so this was it.  We made the reservation on Dec 2nd and confirmed there wouldn't be a pre-set menu.    New Year's Eve rolls around and I get a call at 2:30 pm before our 7 o'clock reservation.  Apparently there was a computer issue and the restaurant would be cash only for the evening.  Okay  fine - easy enough to give my friends the heads up.  Only then  as if an afterthought  the host tells me they had changed their menu to a $75 per person prix fixe.  He tells me this will be the only menu available after admitting that they only managed to put it on their website the week before.  Mind you  if you added up everything you'd be getting for the $75 even if you ordered the most expensive thing in every course you'd only hit around $50 AND you still need to provide your own alcohol.  We tried to speak to a manager to ask if there was anything they could do as we booked well before this menu was set  but the manager was too busy to talk and we were told there was nothing that could be done for us.     Fortunately for us  we found a reservation for 8 at Buddakan for the same time and everyone had much higher quality food for significantly less than $75 per person  even including alcohol and gratuity.   Don't waste your time!\n",
      "I LOVE this place. All the waiters are extremely accommodating and entertaining and they always seem to give some appetizer or dessert on the house. Hard to beat prices plus it's a BYOB. Food is delicious  and portions are always enough for my next day's lunch....If you haven't gone yet  you are missing out!!\n",
      "-The food was great. -My experience was great. -I will return for dinner  I was seated quickly  I had reservations. The menus and service went smoothly. I brought my bottle of wine  I love BOYB. Overall I had a great night at La Fontana Della Citta.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mel has been wanting to try La Fontana for some time and last night was our first visit.  -We had 8:00 reservations and at 8:00 our table was ready! Great. -We  once again  got an aisle table  but honestly there was enough room between tables that I didn't feel I was being crowded. -Server knew the menu and answered questions politely. His name was Emri. If you visit  why not ask for him? -The place was fully seated and it was a bit noisier than I'd prefer. -The menu wasn't very inspiring. Only Talapia or Salmon as fish choices. All the beef  veal  chicken  and pork dishes were the same style. -The food came out hot  and as advertised. Big plus. We had the spinach  and the antipasti for apps. -They do tend to be aggressive about moving you along through your meal. I mean as soon as we finished our apps  the plates were gone. -They entrees came out piping hot and as advertised. We both had pasta dishes. Mel had gnocchi and I had a seafood with vodka red sauce dish. Both were good and decent portions. -We didn't stay for dessert as we wanted to go someplace else. -Total tab was $68.00 for the two apps and two pasta dishes.  It's a three star....probably will go again kind of place.  If it was a bit more quiet and if the menu was a bit more inspiring they would definitely get 4 to 5 stars.\n",
      "Our out of town friends visited us a few weeks ago and we took them to this BYOB Italian place. We made a reservation but we still had to wait for about 20 mins. The hostess felt bad so she gave us a free place of cheese while we waited. I had a HUGE seafood pasta dish that had tons of actual seafood like scallops and shrimp. It was a special so the sauce was tomato based I believe. My fiance had the Strip Steak from the specials and honestly it was over done and expensive. We are from Texas so maybe we are not used to steaks Italian style. Our friends also had a seafood pasta dish and tilapia dish that were good. Overall the ambience was nice  lively and cozy  the wait staff was very attentive and polite. We had a good time catching up with our friends and wish we had brought more wine.\n",
      "Went back again last night and had a really nice meal. Service was very helpful and attentive. The linguine special with shrimp  crab and scallops was chock full of seafood. Comfortable place  good food and a relaxed pace. Not the most exceptional food going  but a nice place we'll come back to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best cupcakes ever! My friend bought an assorted box of cupcakes for me for my birthday and I can honestly say I've never had cupcakes that were so good! I brought them into work and my co-workers had the same exact sentiments. I'm hooked for life! I'd recommend these cupcakes to anyone. If you don't try them  you're missing out.\n",
      "This is what a whoopie pie is supposed to taste like.  I tried red velvet  guiness  black raspberry  and banana.  They are all amazing.  Cream cheese filling  soft pies.  I will dream about this place.  Also there was not a huge line  so that was nice.  Inside of the Reading Market about in the middle.\n",
      "Expensive  but the pistachio icing alone earns it 5 stars. I recommend letting them warm up to room temperature. Their display case makes them a little too cool.  UPDATE  I was at Reading Terminal in late June and sure enough  they did not have Pistachio icing. I'm taking them down a star.  FURTHER UPDATE:  Went there July 3. Pistachio is back. One flaw though: they put these green sugar crystals on top. They take away from the pistachio flavor. Still  a strong cupcake and worthy of the $2 during a visit to Reading Terminal.  Still worth trying when in Reading Terminal\n",
      "I got a traditional whoopie pie and it was everything a whoopie pie should be. Dense  chocolaty   perfect balance of sweetness. Tried a vegan chocolate chip for my little man and it was so satisfying without being greasy or heavy. Love that they don't go crazy with the sugar. Can't say the same about milk bar worse cookies I ever had.\n",

      "Flying Monkey is awesome because someone there had the brilliant idea to bake a tasty pumpkin pie inside a luscious chocolate cake  a delicious apple pie inside a scrumptious vanilla cake and them layer them together with an enormous amount of sugary butter cream frosting.  Brilliant!    When moving to Philadelphia from San Francisco  I spent a lot of time trying to convince my husband that Philadelphia offered *something* cool.  But San Francisco is pretty awesome.  And I was losing the battle.   Then  in a random internet search I landed on Flying Monkey's Pumpple Cake.  And I finally had *something* in Philadelphia that San Francisco did not offer.  And it was something awesome.    Flying monkey is innovative but also tasty (I love the coconut cake truffles and the whoopies).  And I love the idea of the pumpple cake (even if in actuality the other stuff tastes better).\n",
      "Wow  this place was a disappointment. 2.25-2.50 for hard as a rock  weirdly flavored cupcakes.  I bought the lavender  meyer lemon  guinness  peanut butter  and creme brulee. The lavender was absolutely disgusting and tasted like they threw body lotion on top of a cupcake  and sold it . The meyer lemon was extremely sugary and did not have much of a lemon taste to it. The guinness was very oddly flavored and did not taste like guinness at all. The peanut butter was very very rich and way too peanut buttery. All you tasted was the frosting. The creme brulee tasted a little bit like french toast  and was the only cupcake that I would even consider eating if it was the last cupcake available on earth.  The icing on all of the cupcakes was hard as a rock  and the presentation of the cupcakes made them look like they were iced by my 5 year old cousin. Nasty all around.\n",
      "My friend got the vanilla cupcake and I got the Iced Tea.   Overall  service was great and fast and the Iced Tea is sooooo good! I added sugar to it and it was better!!  One request would be have sweetened ice tea on the menu!!   I will be back and recommend this place to other people.\n",
      "vegan cupcake was tasty & I noticed a vegan chocolate chip cookies.  more vegan options (like  at least one more cupcake & a whoopie pie) would get them more stars :)\n",

      "Dim Sum garden is my favorite Shanghai restaurant that I have encountered as of yet in America.  The highlight of the whole place is the xiao long bao also known as soup buns.  For the uninitiated these are buns which are delicately made with thin shells and filled with steaming hot soup which consists of pork and broth.  They are to die for but one must also be careful not to have the hot soup squirt out on them which can sometimes be a difficult task.  This place has the best soup buns I have had since I have been to Shanghai. I am serious about this as I have been to Flushing and Chinatown and not found any as tasty as these. They are succulent and flavorful and warm you up from the inside.    Now let's tackle the rest of the menu.  The menu is really trying to cater to all tastes. It has traditional Shanghai dishes to Americanized Chinese food and just plain Fried Chicken with French Fries.  The dim sum items are definitely the highlight.  The aforementioned xiao long bao are the best and available in both pork and pork with seafood varieties. The pork dumplings and siu mai are also good and some of the better I have had. The scallion pancakes are definitely worth a try as well. The pork with sauce noodle is also a favorite of mine and very flavorful.  Some of the other foods are great and some are just average and you do have to pick carefully.  I would also recommend the beef brisket and the mapo tofu. The more Americanized you go the more likely you will be disappointed.  Be sure to check out the daily specials as there is always stuff that is not on the main menu.  Recently there has been this soup which is good I think it is a sweet hot and sour soup though they described as a minestrone. It is good and quite unlike anything I have tasted though there is an excess of broth. The noodle dishes are all great as the noodles are all handmade.    You can really taste the difference.  So if you are deciding between rice and noodles  go for the noodles.  Many of the dishes can also be served in a soup form with the noodles submerged which is also quite good.  Overall there is a lot of variety to please most anyone you bring with you.      Next  the pricing is amazing.  This place is giving McDonald's a run for its money. Most main dishes are under $7 and the portions are quite large.  I would be shocked if you spent more than $20 on a meal for two and left without leftovers especially since there is no alcohol.  Actually the drink selection is limited to tea or soda pretty much.  The food generally comes out pretty quick so it's a good place if you are in a hurry.    The staff is great.  They try their best to be helpful and make you feel welcome despite the language barrier.  They started to remember me by the second time I had come there which is impressive.  I still remember that I came in once when it was empty with a few people and they were doing food prep on one of the tables.  The immediately started to clean up and move to the back room and asked us to sit there. We said it wasn't necessary but they said it was the biggest table and they insisted.  It's moments like that will make you feel welcome somewhere and go beyond what is normally defined as service.  Seriously the people who work here are some of the nicest people I have met a restaurant and that alone makes me want to keep going back.    The location is awful.  It will put a lot of people off. It is a weird area under a tunnel.  There are a lot of shady characters outside at times due to the proximity to the bus stop.  However  in addition to being located next to both the Chinatown and Greyhound bus stops  it is conveniently located close to Reading Terminal Market  the Market East Station  and the Convention Center.  I actually first discovered it wondering around after the flower show. Once again  you literally feel like you are underneath a bridge somewhere about to do a drug deal by the time you reach the place.  Okay I'm exaggerating quite a bit but I have taken people there and they seemed a bit hesitant.  It is safe though really.     The interior leaves a lot to be desired. It is eerily lit by the excessive neon in the front windows.  The furniture is all from IKEA and the wall is painted in an attempt to look more modern.  There are pictures of food above the cashier counter that does not highlight the breadth or best parts of the menu.  The place is very clean but feels damp due to the location being somewhat cave-like.  There is a TV playing asian music videos which are often quite amusing.   The place seems a lot nicer from the inside than the outside.  Don't let the location or the restaurant's appearance put you off this really is a diamond in the rough.   Dim Sum Garden will leave you pleasantly surprised and craving more.  I can personally attest to this as I keep coming back for the food and the people.\n",
      "I travel across town just to eat there.  Fresh dim sum  made while you wait -usually 10 minutes or so.  No matter how difficult they are to eat  the juicy buns are amazing.  Between them and the pan fried dumplings  I can't bring myself to order anything else off their menu.  Little skill or care was put in to the boxy  fluorescent space  but the staff is lovable -and if you can't stand to eat there  they serve to go as well.\n",
      "Let's get this off my chest:  This is not dim sum. This is normal  portioned food. So don't \\dim sum\\\" ME  unless you got your fried taro or radish cakes  shrimped wrapped in rice noodles  and saumai THAT HAS MEAT IN IT.   Otherwise  this is a good place. The Shanghai saumai was like WHOA to my taste buds (sticky rice inside?!) and the green onion pancake was delectable. I totally got the Shanghai wonton noodle soup high. Perfectly seasoned (i.e. salted just enough that the wonton flavor still dominates).  Let's see  oh yes and the Xiao Long Bao was DRIPPING in its juices. And adding juiciness to juiciness was our pork/chive dumplings. Cute little things didn't disappoint.  The condiments they put out (ginger-soy sauce  and this other sweet vinegar) were lovely. Mm!  See? I'm only mad about the name  but my tummy says everything's going to be alllllll right.\"\n",
      "Noodles and dumplings are made on premises. All fresh  authentic and highly tasty.\n",
      "We just ate here about an hour ago  after reading all the wonderful reviews we just had to try it....so we drove an hour from DE and came out so disappointed  we were scared by the facade but that was expected  so  we still went in. Parking in the area was $24...which is not sooooo worth what we went there for. If you were only there to eat the soup dumplings then you'll be satisfied  however  I also ordered the general Tso's which tasted like an orange chicken and our friend ordered a wanton soup that tasted like water. He should know good food  he's a very good cook! Needless to say  next time we come back here we'll be visiting Wokano again.\n",
      "I had some time to kill today once I got off work. So I headed into Chinatown to checkout Dim Sum Garden  since its been one of my bookmarks for awhile.  I ordered the pork buns and spring rolls for lunch. Even though I thought that all of the hype surrounding these pork buns would amount to nothing more than a novelty  these buns turned out to be well worth the ride to get them. Thankfully I read enough reviews to know how to not burn my mouth with the broth  inside. I could have eaten much more  but what I had satisfied my appetite for the afternoon.  I'll have to plot my next lunch here soon. Not many seats available inside at noon. But I'd just as happy taking the order to go.\n",
      "All of what you expect from this type of joint.  Quick  cheap  kinda dirty  staff who speak broken English  wide menu selection  etc.  Not that these are bad things  but Dim Sum Garden doesn't really stand out for me in any way worth reporting.  It's straightforward and safe.  I've been here a couple times now  and actually prefer the pan-fried dumplings over the more renowned steamed \\soup dumplings\\\" which the staff here has pushed on me each time I've visited.  Nothing special really and kind of a pain to eat.  If this is your idea of \\\"fun\\\" then  well...good for you.  Also their chopsticks suck.  They seem...greasy.  Hard to handle.\"\n",
      "I am shamed to say I live a block from dim sum garden and have only just discovered its magic.   my boyfriend and i stumbled past DSG after some drinks and thought it was time to try it. Being not totally sober and not familiar with the soupy dumplings  I immediately made a huge mess and mangled my beautiful dumplings. Our waitress--who epitomized efficiency and basically predicted our every need--intervened and gave us some pointers on how to properly eat them. She also gave us a great recommendation of a dish to try when we were ordering.   As two drunkies with big appetites  we ordered three dumpling varietals and scallion pancake and couldn't possibly finish it all. The whole meal was $18.   As someone who lives in Chinatown  I have yet to find such an intersection of service  taste  and price.   I will be back!\n",
      "Yum! More Shanghai style than traditional Hong Kong style. Very tasty and available at 3 in the afternoon! Our party of 10 thoroughly enjoyed it. (Some of us have lived in HK  and some of us are Asian!)\n",
      "UPDATE 11/19/13: I know prices can go up and all but $2 to $3 per dish is a bit much!!!    I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Thai Food and this restaurant absolutely delivers in all aspects for me. The quality  taste  freshness  and unique style of preparation hits my appetite. I'm a loyal customer despite the slightly and I mean slightly over priced items. I love the duck salad  pad thai  crispy spring rolls and so many other items. Unfortunately  I'm not such a fan of the curry and I'm not sure why. Don't get me wrong the curry dishes are delicious but I just wasn't feeling it that day.   I usually get delivery and I enjoy the online delivery options in order to avoid waiting time on the phone and possibly making mistakes over the phone. You can to specify exactly what you want and how you want it online so I highly suggest that you try that. Of course  going to the restaurant is just as good.\n",
      "I decided to try circles because it had such good reviews and I was craving pad Thai. I ordered the Crab Padthai and it was soooooo yummy. At $18  it was a little expensive for take out  so I was really hoping it wouldn't disappoint and it certainly did not. The crab was fresh and not fishy tasting at all! They put a very good amount of crab too  large chunks everywhere. The pad Thai sauce was amazing and it was a good portion overall.   I ordered for pick up and they were so quick! They told me 10 minutes so I left my house right after ordering. When I got there  my order was all ready to go! It was quick and easy and the staff there were very polite  both on the phone and in person. Although the crab pad Thai was all I tried this time  I will certainly be ordering from here more and trying out more things on the menu!!\n",
      "Got delivery through grubhub which took about 50 minutes  not bad since it was snowing. The food unfortunately was not worth the wait.  Drunken noodles - very greasy  vegetables not cooked well  just all around boring and not worth near the price  Pad Thai - better than the noodles but still dissapointing. A small portion for the price and not much flavor. Also pretty greasy but at least the shrimp were a decent size.  Green Curry - the highlight of the meal  would get again. Enjoyed the chicken and most of the vegetables. Very flavorful  thank god for it to salvage the meal.  Overall  spent $40 all said and done for 2 people and will not be ordering again.\n",
      "I can't believe I haven't written a review of Circles. I typically do take out  but have never had a bad experience with it. The food is ALWAYS amazing - especially the pumpkin curry. Pad thai is great  along with basically all the other noodles I've had.  Whenever we are unsure of what to do for dinner - it ends up being a Circles order.\n",
      "So we've decided to sleep over at philadelphia  feels for some thai food and ordered delivery from this restaurant.  It takes 1.15 minutes for the food to arrived. The food was ok  but the price way OVERPRICED.  C'mon folks  we are talking about Philadelphia  especially South Philly. How big is your expenses could be? Why charged so much money for Beef Fried Rice? $14 for a fried rice?? It's not even enough to share for 2. Well  If you think this restaurant served authentic thai food  You are wrong. It's not worth the trip. Enough said....\n",
      "Excellent vegetable red curry with brown rice. Excellent -   I've eaten at many Thai  Resturants....  u deserve the Best  I order atleast 2-4xs weekly yum yum. That DeLish!!\n",
      "this place is worth the walk/bus ride/bsl sojourn if you're not in/near south philly! i ordered take-out on my way home - house salad and eggplant stinger (with tofu and a side of white rice)  to be exact. total price was 17 usd and some change (not including tip.) since i'm now used to philadelphia's restaurant price point (compared to that of my beloved new orleans which was generally inexpensive and delicious)  i expected a small portion of each item for the total that i was quoted over the phone. this assumption was wrong. both dishes could have easily fed two people.    as for the food  the salad was a little better than standard - with the usual lettuce (iceberg)  tomato  cucumber  carrots but there were some red onions and broccoli florets for ~*pizazz*~. the best thing that came with the salad was the peanut dressing  it's kind of sweet but with the roasted heaviness of the peanuts. i would come back to this place just for the dressing.  the eggplant stinger was a healthy portion of eggplant  bamboo  and bell peppers with really tasty pan fried tofu. (you can choose from a variety of meats with each option being a different price.)  if i remember correctly  the menu said there would be a sweet and spicy sauce  but there was more of the latter than the former. i actually liked that the eggplant dish wasn't very sweet since the salad dressing was sweet enough for both items  however  if you're expecting something sweeter  bypass the eggplant stinger. of note  if you're a \\thai hot\\\" kind of person  you'll need to request more heat if you get the eggplant stinger because the spicing is at a very reasonable level for the vast majority of diners.  this place is busy as evidenced by the cooks feverishly working in the back and the girl at the register fielding take-out calls. my wait time to get my food was a reasonable 30 minutes since i was walking home and needed the extra time to get to the restaurant. there is a delivery service option  but i don't know the exact areas to which circles will deliver.  either way  go there now to get some delicious affordable thai\"\n",
      "Simply delicious and perfectly prepared. The spicy is truly spicy and a bit unbearable for my taste. On a separate occasion I got the medium and the spicy was just right.  can't go wrong with pad Thai or the beef pad see ew.\n",
      "So  the food is generally very good. The pad thai will most certainly hit the spot. I've ordered from here around 5 times or so  and haven't been disappointed with how the food TASTES. However  the portion sizes are a rip-off. The pad thai is a decent size  but order any of the curries and you can almost count the pieces of chicken on one hand. They're not very big pieces either... and for $10-$15 for the curries  it's totally a rip off.\n",
      "Good Thai food is difficult to come by apparently....some may have good Pad Thai  but lacking in Curry...however  Circle's seems to have a good grasp on all things Thai Food related.  We ordered on a Friday night  and ordered an absolute feast. The food arrived quickly and hot. There were several highlights to the meal  including the crab rangoon- i am a huge fan of the plum dipping sauce!  The only reason Circle's is not 5 stars is the heat level tends to vary- we ordered everything mild or medium  yet most of it was incredibly spicy.\n",
      "Delicious Thai food at an affordable price. Both the Tom Yum and the Tom Kha Gai are amazing  although the Tom Yum has a bit of a kick which might be too spicy for some. The Phad Thai and Drunken Noodle are great as well. The Red Curry was my favorite thing I tried. I will definitely be back to try more items!\n",
      "\n",
      "Friend and I came here for dinner one night at her recommendation and I was pleasantly surprised by everything. We split the red curry and a drunken noodle dish and both of them were spot on - I do wish they were bigger portions but with a drink plus dessert  I was definitely satisfied by the end.   Service was very good  very friendly  and I felt very welcome at the restaurant. Apparently the art on the wall was actually shipped over from Thailand but that's just something I've heard.   For dessert I would go with the fried ice cream.\n",
      "I am Thai and I went for the first time with a couple of my Thai friends who already had gone twice. We tried the chicken red curry and a few appetizers. They were all very awesome and all I can say is that so far everything here is very authentic. In addition to an enjoyable and friendly atmosphere  they very care about the service. The price here is very very reasonable given that the amount of food is quite like American portion.  They also offer a variety of fusion menu that we really like to try next time. We will definitely go again and surely this is my favorite Thai place. They are more than happy to take any comments to make their restaurants the best of the best Thai restaurant in town.   :)\n",
      "I've been to JJ Thai several times and I always leave full and satisfied! Most recently  my friend and I tried their green curry and their duck noodle soup. My soup came with a salad as a starter and the soup itself had a ton of meat in it which was wonderful! Very tasty broth  would definitely order again!\n",
      "Came here awhile back for lunch when I was craving Thai food.  Now I come with my husband every couple of weeks. Love the green curry  drunken noodles and pad Thai. Their salmon is also really good.  The tuna portion wasn't great  but it was tasty. Every time we leave  we are glad we went.\n",
      "This is by far my favorite Thai restaurant in Philly!  My husband and I come here a few times a month  and have tried almost everything on the menu. We love the Drunken Noodle  PraRam  and Pad Gra Paw. You can't go wrong with anything here-- it's all very good!\n",
      "Everything here is great  it's my go to take out place. My favorite is pad see ew  I could eat it in bulk for weeks.\n",
      "I eat here every day for lunch (no exaggeration). The soups and pad thai are beyond words to describe! The staff is supreme! Love  love  love it here!\n",
      "Tried to go to Smile Cafe around the corner  but they were closed on vacation that day  so we wandered a few steps (after a quick yelp search) and came into JJ Thai. It was very good. Their lunch specials are offered on the weekend  which was cool  and the food was delicious. Service was fast and friendly. The restaurant was a bit fancier than we planned for (Smile is much more casual) but no one seemed to mind that we were all fairly hungover and half-asleep. I'll remember this when I want to take a client for some delicious Thai in the future.\n",
      "Impeccable food and service! We figured if we were gonna do Sbraga  we needed the chefs counter 6 course with wine pairings. A pricy endeavor but no regrets. I loved having a front row view of the deliciousness about to be laid in front of me. The team behind the line on this particular Saturday night ran like a well oiled machine.   The tone was set with the amuse Gruyere popover with foie gras soup. Heavenly! There were no duds on the menu  but other standouts were the saffron spaghetti with blue crab  the crispy Arctic char and the chicken liver mousse (btw I thought I hated chicken liver). The wines were matched very well.   My friend was celebrating a birthday so I included that in the notes when making the reservation. To top off the experience  they gave her a note signed by Sbraga and a little goodie bag. Can't wait to return!\n",
      "We had an amazing meal and experience!   The service is wonderful - attentive and knowledgable and the ingredients and the preparation.   Every bite was delicious as is the $55 price for the 4 course tasting menu. The gruyere popover was hot and savory and the perfect popover. I could eat a large bowl of the foie gras soup with the flavors of thai chilies and lemon grass. Both pastas were divine - the rigatoni with carrot top pesto with rabbit (prob the best dish of the night) and the saffron bucatini with blue crab with a little spice from fresno chillies. We had the fried game hen and the tile fish for mains. The tile fish was fine but couldn't compete with the flavor explosion of the game hen although the shrimp dumplings were tasty - wish there were more.  Desserts were a luscious semifreddo and carrot cake.  Drinks were well made but overpriced compared to the price point of the tasting menu (obvi to make some $$$).  Can't wait to go back. Wish we had more $55 tasting menus in NYC.\n",
      "My fiancé and I went to Spraga last night..needless to say it was our first and last time dining at this establishment.  We were pretty pumped to go here since we live right down the street and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at Fat Ham a few weeks ago.  The food was good but not show stopping.  My major issues were with the service.  1 word.  Unbelievable.  We spent $180 on 2 people.  When you spend that much money on a meal.. You expect perfection with food  service and ambiance.  This place underwhelmed and now I have to deal with my fiancé who is still raging with last nights experience.  Thanks Spraga.  Issues: 1.  Soups came before cocktails.  I finally had to ask a manager where our cocktails we're because it so long.  - not in my world if I'm paying $180!   2.  First course came while we were still eating our soup..so we had 2 plates in front of us on a cramped table.  Hello serving 101 at like the most basic restaurant in the world..Don't bring the next course when people are still eating their first!  Again I would expect shit like this to happen if I were at TGI Fridays but I wasn't at TGI Fridays.  I was at SPRAGA. 4. The waiter tried to remove plates while we were still eating from them.  Say what?  Not when I'm paying $180 on a meal son!  You leave the plate until I am finished! 5.  The waiter would awkwardly come to the table and just stand there.. Obviously we know he came to take our food order or dessert order but you say \\ Is everyone ready?.. I'd like to take your order\\\" etc.  WTF.  Nope he just stood there... Weird!   6.  Empty glasses/butter dishes left on the table throughout the meal.  Sloppy.  The server tries to take plates we are still eating from but leaves sangria glasses etc for the entire meal?  I just.  Don't.  Get it.    All in all food was good  not amazing and I've had better service at Tangier.  If you are going to spend that much money go somewhere else.\"\n",
      "What a great experience! The courses are delicious and it's hard to make a wrong choice here. Also  a surprisingly great cocktail menu (in the top three restaurant menus I've had) and attentive staff. Every minute and every plate was amazing.\n",
      "I'm not one to watch the chef shows so celebrity chefs don't do me. That said  the food was creative and cutting edge. We had the  four course tasting menu. The dishes have many flavors that reveal themselves to you one at a time which is fun. Small portions  but enough food. I had a wonderful glass of Argentinian wine which was fun. My only disappointment is that they only change the four course menu seasonally so no real incentive to go back again until next season unless I ante up for the six course menu which is just a little too pricey with a kid in college.  Wonderful service. Really top notch which is becoming more and more rare these days.\n",
      "Can I first confess that while I'm a Top Chef fan  I'm mistakenly thought Kevin Gillespie was Kevin Sbraga? Imagine my surprise when I sat down to my New Year's Eve meal and I saw a brown bear instead of a ginger bear.  I've been excited to know a Top Chef winner has opened up a restaurant a few blocks down my place but I haven't gone for months because I felt somewhat intimidated. The price is of course a little higher and I've always had a distaste for restaurant that only offers taste and not fulfillment. So when it was a few days before X'mas and the few restaurant newsletter ever so \\gently\\\" reminded me that the New Year's Eve dinner is actually a big deal  I started soul searching for a restaurant that I always wanted to try but haven't had a chance to do so  my mind landed on Sbraga.  The place has the very same decor that the hipper restaurants in Philly and New York favors  walls lined with wood planks  the very urban wood cabin feel. Silver and black balloons filled up the ceiling for NYE  the place was packed with people.   On New Year's Eve  they offered a 4-course champagne menu. While it is nice  it's 3-times more expensive with no selection whatsoever and I'm a light-weight drinker  and it was early and I like to choose  so we opted for the regular four-course menu.  I indulged in the rich and surprisingly sweet Foie Gras Soup. It's velvety  almost like a sabayon. For the second course  I had the Sea Bream which I recommend the dish wholeheartedly. The Sea Bream has a really crispy skin  the fish is well cooked. The same can be said about the piece of pork belly in the dish. I also love the squid ink sauce and the calamari \\\"noodles\\\". Love it. would eat it again  would even try to make it in my own kitchen. For the third course  I had the fettucine with the perfectly cooked 62 degrees egg. the egg is indeed perfectly cooked  but it's not much different from a pasta carbonara. Maybe even less  since the amount of pasta is little and the dish is recommended to be mixed up  the pasta to egg sauce ratio is a little out of whack. The whole dish is a little more \\\"decomposed\\\" than I like it to be. The churro/coffee creme brulee is a nice finish to the meal.   I wish that the whole meal is more filling  but at the end it wasn't too bad. Me and my friend was debating whether we wanted a sandwich after the meal  but it was fine. Service was good  our server is charming even though he spilled some water. I had a Sbraga Punch which to me tasted very much like cough syrup and he had no problem switching it to the Bell Hop for me which was quite unique and pleasant. Being sat right next to the kitchen also has its perks  other than being right in Sbraga's face  occasionally you'll hear they yell \\\"Service!\\\" which it's almost like they're putting on a show for you before you hear it enough and you wonder whether they are having problems with their wait staff. The couple next to us were obviously not a Top Chef fan  since their waitress told them that she'll \\\"relay their compliments to Kevin\\\" and they were murmuring to themselves that they had no idea who Kevin was.  Will I go back? I would probably  if a friend hasn't been and suggest to go. Personally  I still like to have a meal that fills me up  especially if I have to pay almost $100 per person.\"\n",
      "Sbraga: good  but not great. I dined here on a Saturday evening and ordered the four course tasting menu with some friends. We were seated promptly and the service was great. I ordered the fried green tomatoes with smoked shortbreads and cumin aioli  sea bream with rustic bread salad and hummus  meatloaf with bacon marmalade and the chocolate mousse taste with pistachio ice cream. My first two courses were excellent. It was my first time eating shortbreads  and I was pleasantly surprised. The sea bream dish was light and very tasty. However  I felt things fell short with the meat course and the dessert. The texture of the meatloaf was too crumbly  and I think I prefer my meatloaf to be a little more solid. It also seems that they included olives in their bacon marmalade and the taste of the marmalade was just too vinegary for me. And as for the dessert  it was just ok. I was able to taste the other desserts my friends ordered  and I was not really impressed by them  either. Also of note  almost every dish that came out was liberally garnished with dill-not that I mind dill  but after the third course  that was a lot of dill. Overall  it was a good meal. But for $49 dollars  I don't know if I would necessarily come back.\n",
      "You would think when you have a prix fixe menu it would make it easier to choose what you want to eat - at Sbraga this is definitely not the case.  It is actually quite complex and involves solid negotiating and compromising skills with your fellow table-mates to ensure that you get a bite of everything you wanted to try!  For the first course I got the Foie Gras soup.  Unless you have some animal rights hang-up about it - you should get the soup.  It's probably the best soup I've ever had.  I also tried the pork belly.  It was just okay - almost like a pork belly carpaccio (in texture and thickness).    The second course I had the calamari.  In my head I was thinking crispy calamari - just because that's the only calamari I've ever had.  These were large calamari with an almost scallop texture to them.  The salsa verde was good  but I wasn't a huge fan of the calamari itself.  Also tried the salmon which was good - not great.    For the third course I had the meatloaf - it was excellent.  Perfectly tender and seasoned.  I also had some of the pasta someone got - it was also very good.  For dessert I had the pistachio bread putting which was a deconstructed dessert with the ingredients all separated on the plate.  It both looked stellar and was tasty.  Surprisingly - I felt full despite the rather small portions.  All in all there were some excellent dishes (get the soup I tell you!) - but there were also a couple 'so-so' dishes.  For $100 a head (after a couple drinks per person) and small portions  I would expect a bit more consistent excellence for 5 stars.\n",
      "My one sentence take: It's not the most delicious food you've ever had  but it may be the most interesting.  The only real options are a $45 four-course meal or a $65 chef tasting meal. While the four-course meal may not seem like much and the portions look small  the dishes are really rich. I have a big appetite and was actually pretty full at the end of everything. I would also say that the desserts are the only more traditional part of the menu  and they were excellent.  Sbraga serves some really interesting combinations of flavors  many of which I'd never even comprehended. Oysters with apple  jalepeno  and caviar  lamb chop with lamb belly and oatmeal  quail with sweetbreads  scallop and pork belly with watermelon and jalepeno  etc. There were no bad dishes that we tried  and I won't really recommend favorites (check that  the miso black cod was our semi-unanimous choice for best dish). What you order should mostly depend on your tastes and how adventurous you're feeling that night.  One disappointment was that the Singapore Sling was taken off the menu. I was really looking forward to trying it. Oh well.\n",
      "Good  but not extraordinary  and for a place that is taking the tasting menu prix fixe approach  ultimately disappointing for a $80+ pp meal.  The food ranged from very good to delicious  with the exception of the octopus 2nd plate  which had grainy sandlike particles that made me feel like I had sand in my mouth while eating it.  A shame too  because the harissa it was served with was excellent.  The first plate  a chicken liver mousse  was good  but not exceptional.  The lamb ragu rigatoni 3rd plate was the highlight of the meal  but it had more of a high level comfort food quality than a gastronomique appeal.  All that being said  the biggest failure of Sbraga is the rushed service.  For a place of this caliber (theoretically)  I could not believe how fast we were pressured to order  and also how little time between courses there was to pause  have conversation and sip wine.  So  while the menu was creative and fairly well executed  the service and the banal decor leave something to be desired.  The price here is more reflective of the real estate location (Broad St right next to the Kimmel Center)  than the experience.\n",
      "This place has been around for years and still decent...They have been living off their reputation these days and their loyal customers...To be honest  quality and service has suffered over the years because of that but still a nice place to go and enjoy pizza!!!  It's BYOB so even better!!  Enjoy if in neighborhood but have a call ahead of time...\n",
      "In my opinion  there are 4 things that make a place great: good food  fair price  atmosphere service  and most important....CONSISTENCY!   Taconelli's has one of these 4. good food.  not great.....good.  they used to be great  but not anymore. they are way too expensive  the service is borderline dreadful  and they are NOT consistent.  i will get a pie  and it is fantastic  the next day  horrible. can you imagine having to order your dough at 11am  to pick it up at 4pm  and you have to wait for 25 minutes when you get there?? that pizza better make me tingley if i have to deal with that nonsense. And it does not make me tingley. i live in port richmond  but drive to the taconelli's in new jersey!!!  what does that tell ya!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been hitting up Tacconelli's since high school but that was before yelp was kewl. If you dont know the drill  cash only  call ahead and pre-order your dough (reservation obv)  don't order more than 2/3 toppings. Oh they're also BYO!  I'm a thin pizza kinda gal and Tacconelli's fits my needs (hence the less than 3 toppings rule). We ordered a pepperoni  extra cheese  and white with spinach and tomatoes. I liked the white the best but all were great.   Hands down best pizza in Philly.\n",
      "I've heard tales about Tacconelli's and now I know why it's a neighborhood staple and Philadelphia institution. The pizza is great. The crust is thin  the sauce is really tasty  and it's topped with quality cheese. This place has rules though  so be aware of them before you show up. You call ahead and order the number of pies you'll eat - if you're still hungry too bad. If you're full and want to cancel a pie  you're out of luck. You ordered it  you're taking it home. Totally Philly  right. Expect a crowd  some noise  and a pizza you'll still be thinking about a week later.\n",
      "I ate here with family from out of town about a month ago on a Saturday night  wanting to show them a Philly classic. The original  white pizza with spinach and tomato is always fantastic. Unfortunately  the service leading up to being seated was less than desirable. We had a reservation for 6:00 PM but we weren't seated until 6:45 with absolutely zero apologies from the host. 45 minutes waiting on their bench isn't the best of experiences.\n",
      "calling to reserve dough? and almost 20 bones for a pie ... in Kennsington? cuz the crust is thin enough my fat ass ate a whole pie by myself ? either way the margherita pizza is pretty tops. near perfect thin crust and a very nice sauce  I personally would take a bit more cheese but let's no quibble. I would stick to the margherita though  the other times I had pie's w  toppings I have not been too impressed w  the quality. the mushrooms tasted like they were from a can and the anchovies were pure shit. sausage and pepporoni were acceptable but the real star was the margherita...u sexy  saucy  little bitch !\n",
      "Make sure to make a reservation a few days in advance because they tend to book up. Made a reservation for a Friday night for 5 people and when we went in  got seated right away. Got 5 pizzas  the crust is thin so it's easy to have multiple slices....plain  Margherita  pepperoni  the special (white with tomatoes and spinach) and peppers and sausage. All delicious and able to take home whatever we didn't eat! Definitely recommend!\n",
      "Best pizza in Philadelphia  hands down.  Thin  sweet  garlicky  crispy while somehow still being chewy.  It's soooo good.  It's one of two pizza places that makes me say  \\this is DEFINITELY the best pizza I've ever had\\\" every time I eat there.  The other place is De Lorenzo's tomato pies in Trenton  NJ.    Pizzas are a bit expensive and they are thin so you may need to order a bit more than you are used to but it's totally worth it.\"\n",
      "I won't lie and say the pizza is bad.  There is something wrong with someone who would claim that.  But $15/person for pizza in a place that serves NOTHING other than pizza  and serves it on paper plates  is a rip-off.  No salads  no pastas  no desserts  NOTHING OTHER THAN PIZZA.  This is absolutely not a place to bring a date or even a spouse.  It's unattractive and your breath will smell.  All that being said I would strongly recommend that potential diners ignore the temptation to order like you would in a regular pizza place IE pizza with pepperoni  sausage  green peppers  and onions  and do as the locals do   Get a white pizza with crushed tomatoes and spinach.  I've been here numerous times and recently found the tomato sauce on the regular pies to by WAY too sweet.  I don't remember this being the case in the past - the recipe must have changed  and not for the better.\n",
      "very very good!  i had the lamb kabob  morrocan cigars  and fried cauliflower.  all of it was delish.  good portions  and good prices.\n",
      "my favorite french fries in philadelphia!!! really friendly workers  very clean. i go there all the time and never get sick of it\n",
      "Great spot. All the food is fresh and healthy with great flavor and great sauces. The pricing is very reasonable for the the serving sizes. Chicken shawarma is probably the most famous dish and it's excellent. Platters come with 3 sides and pita. Sandwiches are excellent and filling too. Great  healthy alternative to the over-priced salad place down the street. The owner is a good guy and loves giving samples of the new sauces he's working on. Going to start coming more often.\n",
      "Tried this place again and found it to be quite good.  Tasty falafel platter with good (yes  good!) hummus and other appealing side dishes.\n",
      "All I wanted was some veggies on pita. So I went to Hummus. And this was a mistake.  The girl working the counter seemed very nice and helpful. When it was my turn to order  I asked for just a veggie pita. She got a very confused look on her face and told me  \\That's not on the menu...\\\" So I asked for a hummus pita without the hummus.   My order came up  and I proceeded to sit at one of their overly cramped tables. There was hummus on my pita. No big deal  I'll just ask them to fix it. I didn't think this would be an ordeal. I kindly told the girl that I had asked for no hummus. She told me that what I wanted wasn't on the menu  so I couldn't order it.  ......... -.- what? You have veggies  you have pita? But I can't have a veggie pita? After I stared at her with a perplexed look  she finally agreed to make The Most Complicated Order of The Day.   After my accomplishment  I sat down and ate my pita. It was very tasty  I'd give it a three. I also tried the fries which were great and gets a five. Service? I'd give a one. The girl just seemed like she was programmed to go by what's exactly on the menu. I know it's not Burger King where You Have it Your Way  but my order was not difficult at all.  I will give them a second chance though. But only because of the fries.\"\n",
      "I've only been to Hummus once so far. It was a welcome addition to my lunch rotation  as I work in the area.   I settled for the Chicken Kabob Platter. The portions were ample  but I felt the chicken was a bit rubbery.   The Falafel Sandwich looked like a better bet  and at only $8 it's cheap and will fill you up.  I wonder if the Rami Falafel truck down the street feels threatened by Hummus? We shall see.  Hummus is a lot larger inside than it looks  and is all new construction  I believe. It at least smells like it.  I had some Mango bottled drink there that I forget the name of. It was sweet and hit the spot. I recommend that for now.  The way it works is  you order the food and they bring it out to you on a tray. No wait staff.  The place does take out  and you can sit outside if you care to look at the construction going on as well as the homeless people sitting at the McDonald's next to it.\n",
      "Very decent and fulfilling Middle Eastern food. They have great catering as well. I love the cucumber/tomato/onion salad  falafel  lamb  and chicken. rice is really good as well as the pita. decent prices.   i would highly recommend this place for any person who loves middle eastern food and is craving it.\n",
      "\n",
      "On our first visit  my friend and I both ordered the shawarma platter. It was amazingly terrible--trying to eat the chicken was like trying to methodically force wood chips down your throat. The rice and assorted vegetable sides were uninteresting  but at least they weren't a struggle to eat. The only redeeming part of the meal was the pita bread.   Since then  I've returned a few times  masochistically ordering the shawarma platter again in hopes of being surprised with an edible meal. It's never been as bad as the first time  but if you're looking for Mediterranean  Greek Lady is just around the corner.\n",
      "This is one of my go-to places in University City. When I don't feel like spending a lot of money on some decent food. For $8  I get two meals worth of food.  I'm vegan  so all my experiences involve the hummus  roasted veggies  and falafel platters. The pitas are awesome - warm  soft  tasty. I always go for the whole wheat pitas. The sides are great too.   I normally just get take-out but I've also had meals there with friends. The seating is a little bit tight  but it's not impossible to enjoy a meal there.   The staff is really friendly and happy to answer any questions you have.\n",
      "This place never disappoints.  Even though they didn't have the seafood listed on the menu for our dish   the substitutions might have been better. Since it is a tiny place there is sometimes a wait...  But it's well worth it. As always   the leftovers were just as delicious...\n",
      "Great Cambodian food in South Philly! I've been here three times (once to eat in and twice for take out) and haven't been disappointed once.   The must haves:  Mussels in red curry sauce (Cha Mussels): creamy  savory  and a little spicy. I poured the red curry sauce over everything.  Prat-Hee: Minced pork with raw veggies to dip (eggplant  peppers  cucumbers  etc.) It's a little bit oily and a little bit salty but extremely flavorful and satisfying   Chicken Curry (or whatever they have as a special): potatoes and chicken and a delicious warm soup. Perfect for winter days.   Papaya salad is also great for something light and fresh!  4 stars instead of 5 because I pass out every time post-meal. Pretty sure there's some MSG in there.\n",
      "Huge portions and very reasonable prices. It has a hole in the wall type of interior  but it's very clean kept. I've never had authentic Cambodian food anywhere else  so I can't make any comparisons  but I left with a very content (and large) belly!\n",
      "\n",
      "I was excited to try this place out and planned on getting to this place no matter what while I was in Philadelphia.  My friend and I took a taxi from DT to the restaurant when it opened. Got seated quickly and ordered 3 items to try - grilled steak with prohak dipping sauce  caramelized ground pork with coconut milk and vegetables  and samlaw machu kreung (beef soup with vegetables).  My least favorite was the caramelized ground pork - it was a little too sweet for me.  I love this dish at other Cambodian restaurants but unfortunately it was too sweet here.  But the rest of the dishes were very very delicious.  I wanted to order other dishes but there was only 2 of us and it would have been too much food.  Got a chance to talk to the family that owns this place and they were very friendly.  Highly recommend.\n",
      "Super good food here.  I am pretty new to Khmer food  i can't express that this is amazing and the portion is family style.  So if you order too much.. prepare to bring it home and eat it again!    Home made food here may take a bit to prepare depending on what you get  but it's worth it as it is made fresh on most items.  just BYOB and enjoy the food with your families/friends\n",
      "Synopsis: Great LITTLE restaurant with friendly service  great food  and reasonable prices...  FYI: Cash Only- BYOB +  The 5-6 table restaurant was clean and had friendly service. I ordered the assorted meat skewers for appetizer ...they were mild in flavor cooked to perfection...came with sweet & spicy sauce (very good). Entrées were Prah-Hok Kahteeh & (forget the name) Beef with pineapples  peppers  and onions...both were great...reminds me a bit of Vietnamese food but definitely had its own unique flavors...I would recommend to anyone that likes tasty food especially Southeast Asian cuisine.\n",
      "Amazing food  cheap and BYOB. Come early to avoid the lines. I would recommend the curry mussels for apetizer!\n",
      "Happy to have finally gone to this tiny restaurant serviced by the nicest family. The mix of dishes recommended were tasty  a familiar cross of Vietnamese and Thai  though sweeter and less spicy IMHO. My fave was the Prah Hok Kateeh  apparently a recipe of grandma's. And a beef dish that included raw veggies  among them Thai eggplant  with an amazing dipping housemade dipping sauce made from roasted tomatoes. Oh  and remember  cash only.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got delivery from here today from lunch.  The delivery was very quick  within 15 minutes of placing the order.  I got the brie sandwich - definitely recommended.  Brie and apples on toasted cranberry bread.  The taste of the brie goes very well with the apples to balance the tartness. I got it with the israeli salad which had a little too much olive oil but it had a nice lemon kick to it.\n",
      "Breakfast and COFFEE is super-important to me.  So  when I travel  it's a pretty big question of mine...where am I going to find something close to my hotel  that will not cost a fortune and will be healthy and fresh?    When I traveled to Philadelphia recently from San Francisco  I found this place on my first morning trolling the Old City for coffee (which is appallingly hard to find at 11:30am on a Saturday morning).  Thank god for Cafe Ole!  I ended up getting take-out breakfast each morning of my trip.  Good coffee.  Great breakfast wraps.  Great yogurt parfait.\n",
      "Stopped here after free yoga on the Delaware River for breakfast. Get the lox bagel on a multi grain bagel! So much salmon  so delicious!\n",
      "This has turned into my breakfast place of choice whenever I'm in town. The bagels are the wide  thin variety. Quite good  although I actually prefer South Street's bagels when I'm in Philly. Friends always rave about their shakshuka  though  which is why we always end up here. It's not really my kind of breakfast dish  but it does look like a hardy way to start the day and it's an unusual dish to find anywhere.   The atmosphere is great  too. Plenty of tables inside including a big family sized table up front by the window  and tables outside on the front and side when the weather is warm.   A short walk from anywhere in Old City  this'll continue to be my go-to breakfast joint in town.\n",
      "Yeah  they rock too!! How perfect is their Iced Tea! With a sprig of mint  it is the most refreshing drink on the planet!!! I mean it  on the @!#$%^& planet! It always smells great in there and they have a great breakfast menu. My goal is to buy everything in the place. It's also a great place to escape to for a while. Cafe Ole is in the perfect location as well to get all kinds of interesting people coming through at all time. Yeah  they rock too!!\n",
      "Cafe Ole is decent  but a bit bizarre. The food is tasty - I most recently had a European grilled cheese.   The confusing part is paying. Seems like you just pay whenever you want  before during or after your meal. Not that this is a bad policy  it just stresses me out for some reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "People in the 'hood joke that this place should be called \\Cafe Go Away!\\\" and I can't argue. If you actually make it to the front of the line--which often takes 15 minutes for one cup of coffee--the counterpeople seem annoyed and distracted  which leaves me annoyed. Why do I even bother? The excellent chai selection and cold mint tea  as well as outdoor seating. But I don't bother often  and if you're on a time crunch  or abhor apathetic service  you shouldn't either.\"\n",
      "Great ambiance.  Got there too late in the day for the shakshuka  but enjoyed the soup instead.  One of those places that has a weird wonderful vibe with good food.\n",
      "Great outdoor seating when the weather is warm.  Friendly staff and always a good crowd of people eating and drinking coffee.  Love the baklava and spinach salad with goat cheese  cranberries and walnuts.\n",
      "I always enjoy the food I get at Sazon.  They are vegan friendly and gluten free friendly.  They're a tad on the pricier side for casual fare  but the food is worth it.\n",
      "Loved this place. wanted to try it for years. My only regret is having waited so long. Judy and Robert are the owners and seemed to be operating the whole \\front\\\" on their own. They both found time to talk and interact with us  my two daughters and my sister. I had the \\\"Patacon\\\" with beef and ham. Loved every bite. Fresh tomato and avocado  tender shredded  perfectly seasoned beef and a thick slice of ham perfection  all sandwiched between two crispy tostones. We started off with fried plantains and a sampler that included mini arepas  mini empenada and tequenas  soft mild cheese wrapped in dough and fried. All of it delicious. For dessert my girls had house made tropical frozen fruit pops. My older daughter and I had hot chocolate. Not anything like I've ever had before  but wonderful and very dark. My sister had and loved the cacao tea.   Can't wait to go back and try everything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent Venezuelan food! Gluten free options and wonderful deserts!. Had a wonderful time! Excellent and friendly service  delicious food  and remarkable selection of high quality chocolate. I would recommend this place to anyone.\n",
      "Small  friendly  cash-only BYOB with excellent food. Sancocho & asado negro were excellent! Portions are reasonable and prices are a bit on the high side but worth the quality  presentation  and flavor.\n",
      "Fantastic food. I love the sancocho here (although it is a bit greasy) and is one of the only places I've found in Philly that does a good sancocho. the Patacon was also VERY good  and after having some of my friend's  decided that I wanted to come back and get one of my own. We also got a few of the truffles  which are AMAZING!!! Love them!!  I later came back with some other friends for hot chocolate and truffles  and the hot chocolate was DELICIOUS!!!! Tried a few more of the truffles  and yep  still love them. They were out of the churros and chocolate that day (sadness) but hopefully will be back and next time they'll have them.\n",
      "I was hoping i would've liked this place more.  The bean cheese arepa i ordered was just bland.  The arepa itself did not have any flavor.  This was my first arepa and i though it would have a better taste.  The bean overwhelmed the sandwich.  The bf had a tasty chicken soup and sandwich.  The best part of my dining experience was the guava juice made in house.  Sorry to say there was nothing special about this place.  We did not partake in any of the chocolates.\n",
      "Coming from a Venezuelan  this was a terrible food quality experience  tequenos were terrible also pabellon empanada was over fried and filling was still cold\n",
      "Very creative  great atmosphere. Must try the truffles. The Venezuelan cuisine is delicious  and the owners are friendly.\n",
      "Stopped in for dessert.  Very entertained by Roberto--very informative having lived in Venezuela and loving his wife's family and culture there.  A review of everything we tried: Yuca churros with chocolate- wow Super juice- a secret!!  It's super. May need to ask if you want to try. Raw chocolate beans puréed with berries. A cold drink La cuaima-spicy!! Lucky Kentucky-the favorite. Very thick. Everyone loves. Must eat with spoon. I enjoyed a spoon dipped in this and dipped in the spicy la cuaima! Flan- jack says it was ok  it was good  I like it Smurf truffle- very tasty Avocado pistachio truffle- def not sweet. I imagine very healthy :) Darkest hot chocolate with orange- good\n",
      "Highly recommended. Everything we ordered was excellent. The tamale azteca is superb  the cafe con chocolate excellent  and tres leches to die for. Riquisimo. Plus  I got the vibe there was a lot of attention to detail in the decor. We brought vodka and beer  and they were great about keeping our drinks cold for us. We stayed for 2.5 hours and had attentive service. Since it was such a beautiful night when we dined there  I half-wished that they had more substantial outdoor seating. Then again  given the neighborhood  perhaps I'm glad they did not. Either way  my only real complaint is that it takes a solid hour of public trans to get from west to 21st and Snyder. But hey  I ate enough that I needed that 7 block walk back to the sub. Overall  it's a high-quality venue with character.\n",
      "Came here with a group of friends and we all enjoyed it immensely. It was so so so good. We couldn't get over the nachos and then  the rest. One of us got the mole enchiladas and I seriously wish I sat closer so I could eat ALL OF IT. Everything else was delicious too and the cafe chocolate (with shot of espresso) TO DIE FOR. I could bathe in it. SERIOUSLY.  Anyways  the food was great and the people were amazing. I am definitely going back for more. I have tried mexican food in LA but this place was one of the better mexican food places I have tried.\n",

      "Cafe Y Chocolate is truly authentic old-country Mexican food.  The restaurant is a special gem in South Philadelphia  with a traditional and soulful menu of Mexican drinks and dishes.  The warm staff immediately welcomes you in for a meal  and it is a memorable meal every single time.  I have visited this place for so many brunches and dinners over the past few years  and I always leave wanting to come back again before the end of the week.  My usual meals often include Mexican hot chocolates  chipotle potatoes  homemade guacamole  vegetarian tacos  and their tortas (oh  man  the tortas!).  This ain't a meat-and-more-meat kind of Mexican restaurant--they will happily cook for any kind of eater  whether you are a vegan  vegetarian  gluten-free disciple  whatever.  The food at Cafe Y Chocolate is always good.  Always.\n",

      "We decided to try this place after reading http:  philly.eater.com maps philly-under-the-radar-breakfast-restaurants-cafe instead of Honey's. That was a mistake. The food was very flavorful but  the bread was stale. I had the Huevos Motuleños Especiales that suppose to come with tortilla or bread. I had to ask for it. Then  we were charged $1.50 for it. We asked why the menu stated it was included  waitress couldn't give us an answer.  The  Huevos Revueltos con Chorizo was suppose to be paired with bread or tortillas  we didn't get any.   Service was slow. It took us about 10 minutes to get the check. Another 5 more minutes to get my carrot  Apple and ginger juice into a disposable cup. Then  another 5 minutes for our change. I was very disappointed driving all the way from northeast Philadelphia for that. I'll stick with Honey Sit-N-Eat and Cafe La Maude.\n",
      "Just found this place yesterday and went back again today!  Super fresh  super delicious.  Had the Huevos Rancheros both days (amazing verde sauce) and the fish tacos and chilaquiles.  Very friendly staff and delicious strong coffee to round out the meal. Cafe Y Chocolate is fabulous!!!!\n",
      "Food was 3 stars.. Service was terrible enough to bring the rating down to 1.   Ordered coffees and received our food first. Not until we asked for the coffee a third time did we receive it. Forgot half of our desserts.. took 20 minutes to get the bill.. 20 minutes to pay..\n",
      "If you're a west coast transplant  this is the place to give you all the Mexican feels from home.\n",
      "One of the best places I've dined in a long time. Even during the lunch rush hour on a Wednesday  staff remained fast  friendly  and the place never got overwhelmingly full. The communal tables weren't that bad  even though you can hear couples fighting across the way from you. One other patron judged us for indulging in an AWESOME cheese board  mini shepherd's pie  large latte  and lavender polenta cake at 11:30 a.m with a \\that's a lot of food.\\\" Only bad part. Also  screw you man (jealous I think).   The server (man with Newsies hat and forearm tattoo) was so nice and explained every cheese curated for us on the board as well as suggested accompaniments. He handcrafted it with care and it was much-appreciated. Each one was better than the last! I could spend all day reading  talking  and enjoying this lovely place.   My favorite part of my visit to Philadelphia. Thank you all!!\"\n",

      "This review is for the \\Secret Supper\\\" at Talula's Daily  which is a set tasting menu of six courses for $55.    The menu changes each month- and the courses are served family style (with the exception of the entree which came on individual plates).  Our menu for February consisted of warm jalapeno cornbread with honey butter  which were melt in your mouth delicious  a small dish of mussels served with toasted croutons in a broth flavored with lime leaves (the bowl of mussels was a little awkward for sharing among four people- who gets to drink the broth that remains after the mussels are gone..?)  a cheesy cauliflower casserole  tender glazed spare ribs  a cheese course and to end it all deliciously a plate of hot chocolate donuts with vanilla cream!  The food was awesome  expertly prepared and attractively presented by the chef in the open kitchen.  Service was attentive and our waitress explained each course and was knowledgeable about the various wines. An optional wine pairing is available for the meal  but we just ordered by the glass.  What I think I loved the most about this restaurant was how pleasant the atmosphere was  the tables are not on right top of each other  the room was quiet enough for conversation and to hear the soft jazz music playing in the background  the room was candelit  and overall it felt very comfortable and relaxed  with a casual elegance.   I would highly recommend the Secret Supper and the memory of this meal will stay with me a long time!\"\n",
      "Let's put price aside for a moment... Talula's table is a great addition--and lunch option--in Wash West. The good: the prepared foods  like Mac-n-cheese and roast pork sammie  to pre-packaged sandwiches  salads  dips are delish  there are lots of great options  and it's adorable. The bad: lines can be long  this is often a place for ladies who lunch and ill-mannered children  and it's not very big so if it's nice head across the street to Washington square instead. The ugly: prices are pretty outrageous for what it is. $12 for Mac-n-cheese  $9 for a half a pork sandwich  and cheeses are very high-priced. But I guess if I don't want to pay so much I don't have to go there. Hence 4 stars... Overall is a great local lunch and take out spot with high quality food  bacon ($1 a piece - enjoy while in line)  mushroom 'crack'  dip to die for  and beer for all.\n",
      "This was our third secret supper dinner and Talula's Daily came thru with flying colors once again.  We have a group of 5 each time and we all thoroughly enjoy the entire evening.  I recommend the wine pairing. This was the second time we went with it and it was very well done. The description of the paired wine and cuisine is impeccable.  The set menu always has an optional course  get it.  We have always loved it. From delicate french inspired to traditional with a flare american the cuisine and experience is excellent.  Thank you Talula's we will be back once again.\n",
      "Made reservations for the supper club on fourth if July weekend with a friend and can say that this was the best meal I've ever had in Philadelphia. Every one of the five courses was inventive and perfectly cooked. The flower lot bread baked right into a clay flower pot was surprisingly one of the best things about it! I also loved the meaty swordfish kabobs with peach salsa. Not to mention the market was decorated in full anthropology decor and was so cute! We walked out very full and could not stop talking about how amazing the whole experience was. Giving it 5 stars because food  service and atmosphere were all perfect- definitely check it out!\n",
      "Love the food .. healthy and house made. The ambiance is out of one of my dreams. The baristas are friendly and helpful. Expensive. I asked for a cup of soy milk to have with my zucchini bread  you know maybe just 12oz's would do. I think I paid $5 for it *cringe*. It's okay. It was delicious and worth it. But I'll have to save up next time. Lol. Love ya Talula's daily.\n",
      "This place needs an honest review. Obviously  it is beautiful and the ideas are all good but the execution is sadly not.  I went in the third day it was open and ordered a grilled cheese.  I had time to spare  so I sat down and waited  and waited  and 25 minutes later an employee asked if I was waiting for something.  And then 12 minutes later my grilled cheese arrived -- burnt toast and everything.  It was (besides the burnt-ness) a delicious grilled cheese  but it took 35 minutes.  Went back yesterday since I was there one its first days and wanted to try again.  I ordered a frittata as did my friend.  They asked if I wanted it warmed (um  yes) and they whisked them away.  18 minutes later  they arrived at our table and were plunked on the table.  Which one's which? I asked. The employee did not know. That's fine  that's fine. We take our first bite...honestly  not warm at all. I am really not pushy at restaurants because I get it  I've worked in restaurants too  it's not easy! But when you are charging $7 for that grilled chesese  etc. everything from start to finish should be great.\n",
      "I am ... in Love.  Philly Love...that's what they call it?  This is the perfect cafe that has outside seating  without the hustle and bustle of cars driving by and wafting dust in your face.  You actually look into the park  rather than another old building.  This cafe serves a variety of organic coffees  wine (their house boxed...yes boxed..wine..is fantastic!)  cheeses  snacks  deli options and even a dinner setting.    If I had to choose to work remotely  I would choose this little knook.  Outside seating at Taluluas or indoors on their cocktail tables.    Must tries: Iced Coffee Cappuccino Cheese Board  Salami Deli options  Cookie (free from yelp checkin!) House white wine I hear you can order cocktails from Talula's garden  but I'm so happy w/ the offerings here.    The service is great and don't forget the coffee punch card!  Just the absolute perfect setting and likely more affordable pricing than Talula's Garden.\n",
      "Many legitimate complaints about wait times and food sitting out and not freshly made....for the prices  I agree. Given that there's not much else near by to grab and go  I suppose they can up charge for the convenience and locally sourced foods.  I also think the service has been at least friendly and attentive if. It lightening quick. I'll give them a chance to work out the kinks.  I recommend that you at least come here  but come in the nice weather  on a weekend  and get yourself a nice spiked coffee....which you can't getting any other cafe that isn't a straight up bar...and then sit outside and look out over beautiful Washington Square Park. Try a pastry with it. If you're looking for daily lunch every day on your lunch break  well  you may have to wait for Talula to figure out that the coffee is the only thing you can afford to get here every day.\n",
      "Delivery takes a good amount of time  but the pizza is completely worth it. Big slices of thin pizza perfect if you like to fold your slices.\n",
      "My friends all go for pizza which doesn't appeal to me other than fun fact that a large is the size of a small planet. BUT what I did discover whrn I needed a very quick bite  was that their Italian combo is spectacular! Flavorful and fresh  and bonus if you add hot peppers on it!\n",
      "I hadn't had Lazaro's since my undergraduate days and decided it was worth a trip back  now that I live about five blocks away.  It was Sunday night  and Lazaro's was sufficiently busy.  My gf and I ordered a large mushroom pizza and waited patiently in the seating area next door for our pie.  10 minutes.  20 minutes.  25 minutes I go check.  \\Large mushroom?\\\"  It's next  it's next.  We did have a pizza a few minutes later  but for a pizza this thin  waiting 30 minutes was a little long.  And I didn't appreciate the comment from the guy when I went back to get a couple of forks and knives  \\\"next time you should order ahead  you know\\\".  Thanks  jerk.  I will now that I know it takes 30 minutes to make a really flat pizza.    The pizza itself - also about three stars.  The mushrooms were good  but they kind of skimped on the amount they gave.  The sauce is sweet and the crust nice and thin  just as I like it.  Anyway I'm sure I'll be back but I wish there was somewhere that stood out for me as damn good pizza.\"\n",
      "After just moving to Philly  I was excited by the large number of well reviewed Pizza joints in the area.  We tried Lazaro's 1st as it was close to our house.   We got a large half cheese half pepperoni pie and an order of garlic knots. The garlic knots were pretty good. Less greasy than places I've ordered from in the past and definately not overdone on the garlic. The pizza was typical thin crust  but not as crispy as I would have liked. The sauce  however  was superb. It is much sweeter than any sauce I've had in the past and really had a nice zing to it. The peperoni wasn't crispy enough.   Pretty good pizza  but I think I can find better in Philly.\n",
      "good tomato pie or well red pizza.   also good chicken finger sub (with honey lettuce and tomaeters)\n",
      "Great pizza and better service  wish they would take cards tho  other than that  great business\n",
      "i've ordered delivery from these guys a couple of times  whilst working. not only did i enjoy it  i enjoyed to the extent of OMGTHATSAGREATSAMMICH!!!!  seriously....i dig the zucchini sticks  all fried up  too.  (btw--the sammich of awesome is the veggie hoagie--eggplant  ahoy!)\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been ordering from Lazaro's Pizzeria & Grill for years. I have never once been disappointed  and the delivery has always been very quick. Lazaro's is the only place in the city that I order pizza and cheese steaks from  definitely a great choice for any night  especially when the game is on. Thank you for the years of great food and service!\n",
      "I think you should prepare yourself before entering. Get out your hankie  tie your hair back  and prepare to salivate. This is what happens when you enter the haven of Lazaros.   I have to admit to only trying their cheese and white pizza. The white pizza (classic) is what kills me. It kills me with sweet cheesy flavor. And then brings me back to life with the wafting scent of yet another gargantuan slice. You begin to sweat  dare I have another slice? Who is looking anyways? Is this a sin or can I get away with it?! All natural fears. Let me lay them to rest. Lazaros is awesome. It is best to stuff yourself with awesome so that you have awesome inside you. For the next few hours at least. Then you have to come back for more.   Which is EXACTLY what I plan to do this weekend. Me. Lazaros. It's the only kind of date I need to have the rest of my life!   Also  if you are complaining about the size of this food look at their name. Lazaros Pizza House. They had to get a HOUSE added for this kind of food. Because it feeds a house of people. Duh  don't hate  it's implied in the title foo!\n",
      "I was excited to try a new place. I arrived to wait for an hour with no answers to when a table will be available. After pestering the hostess  she says we will reservations coming in  it will be another 30 minutes or so. So waiting an hour and not being able to get a drink or a table I left. I hope to try this place some day.\n",
      "I enjoyed everything about Relish from Raisin in the Sun to the live band to the karaoke to the Hennessy Sangria to the seafood Mac n' Cheese to the Fried Catfish  greens  and sweet potato mash to the fact that my reservation was honored in spite of being about 30 minutes late in arriving to fellowshipping with the party next to us.   The only thing I hated was having to leave  but I plan to visit again real soon!\n",
      "I hosted a birthday party for a loved one at Relish this past Saturday night. It was amazing! We had a party of 40+ including attendees from the age of 1 on up to 96. The birthday girl as well as every single guest in attendance had nothing but praise for Relish. The experience was just great from start to finish. I really appreciated the integrity  professionalism and patience that I experienced throughout the entire event. The establishment  event coordinator  Sherri Lee Stevens and all of the staff  food  ambiance  etc was just wonderful. We had a few mishaps come up on our end (overbooking  tardiness  etc)  however  the wonderful Relish staff was able to work everything out for us  with a smile! I really can't say enough nice things about the place. If I ever have to host another event in Philadelphia  I'll definitely book Relish again. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "My husband and I came here for the first time on Friday 4 22 16. We had a 630 reservation. After our arrival we had about a 15 min wait before being seated in the bar club area. We were seated near the kitchen walkway( a high traffic area). I immediately requested from the host to be moved to the table rt next to me but was told it was reserved for 4 people even though a couple had just vacated it. Although a little disappointed about the seating we went ahead and ordered our dinner. My husband had the crab cake meal and i ordered the chicken meal. The portions were good  however the greens and fried chicken needed a little more seasoning. The entertainment with Cedric Napoleon tanqueray hayward and t webb was awesome. Our server Chai was also very attentive. We were disappointed that within 30 minutes of being seated they sat 2 people at the table next to us which previously they told us it was 4 people. I don't understand why we could not have been sat at that table to begin with. Disappointed that throughout the entire evening we kept getting bumped by waiters waitresses trying to serve others in this high traffic area. Overall rating lowered due to seating accommodations.\n",
      "Celebrated my birthday at Relish.  The service was awesome from the time we entered the door until we left.  Food was great...Fried Chicken  Crab cakes  Short Ribs  Caribbean Chicken  Mac n Cheese  Collards.  Our waitress Kai (I think that's her name) was very attentive and patient.  The music was great....we had at great night and will definitely go back.\n",
      "Y'all. Overrated is not even THEE word. I don't get the hype. I can't believe that my fellow Yelpers deceived me like this.  We came about 10-15 minutes before our reservation for Sunday brunch and was seated about 5 minutes after. So the wait time wasn't bad. Once we were seated we headed over to the buffet and personally speaking I've seen bigger buffets but at this point  I was trying not judge just yet. Took a stroll around the buffet  they had a bit of a variety of food: waffle  omelette and pasta stations  BBQ and fried chicken  fried fish  shrimp and grits  challah French toast  home fries  curry chicken salad  Caesar salad  fruit salad  small desserts  etc.   All that I stated above was practically majority of the buffet. I managed to get a pasta and omelette made to my liking with Caesar salad  fruit  turkey bacon  curry chicken salad and fried fish. Y'ALL! The best thing on my plate was that fried fish and that's probably cause I added hot sauce to it. The rest of the food was... meh. I can't believe I was in a soul food place where the food was not seasoned. The only reason why they are getting two stars is one because of the wait time and the other because the waitress was nice. But it even took long for her to come around at times. Also  the drinks weren't bad. It could be good for a happy hour but as a person who goes to many brunches and places to eat in the tristate area  I was disappointed in the quality of the food. The food was overpriced. Those who gave 4 or 5 stars truly hasn't been to a good brunch.\n",
      "This used to be one of my favorite restaurant in the city  however the service and food have gone by the wayside! It's almost as if they don't even care or think that it's alright to serve you food that is not cooked thoroughly. Save your time and Money!!!!!\n",
      "Excellent Food! Excellent Service! I frequent this place. It's my favorite restaurant in the area. Love the cornbread ( I bought 12 pans for my engagement party). The shrimp and grits dish is amazing.   Entertainment is around $6 a set and can range from eclectic jazz (which I'm not a fan of) to traditional jazz. If your not into the music you can always eat it the main dining room and save your money.   If you would like to experience an assortment of what Relish has to offer  try their Sunday Brunch. Visit www.relishphiladelphia.com\n",
      "I've been wanting to try this place for awhile. People rave about it. I actually haven't gotten a chance to go to the actual restaurant ... But I decided to try UberEATS and Relish was one of the restaurant choices  so I figured why not? I ordered cast iron fried buttermilk chicken and it came with Mac and cheese and collard greens. The chicken arrived crispy and was pretty tasty (not over seasoned!) the Mac n cheese was good  but the noodles were a bit over cooked. The collards were bland... Def could use some seasoning. Maybe my expectations were too high  the food was good don't get me wrong but I've had better soul food. I will try again  but plan to dine in next time!\n",
      "Wanted to find a good option for Southern cuisine and was referred to this place. Decided to surprise my hubby on his 55th birthday. We came on a Sunday so we had the buffet which included a full salad bar. Favorites would be the biscuits  cheese grits  Mac n cheese sautéed cabbage. Everything was good but those were my standouts. The fried fish was nice as well as fried chicken. The service was excellent  the ambience was very nice and the music was great!!  Would definitely make the drive from Jersey again!!\n",
      "I went over to Jake's one day during my lunch break from work  as I had been eager to try that place out for over a year now!  Before I entered  I scanned the menu posted outside the shop  and decided to go try myself a cheesesteak.  I ordered the Steak and Egg  cheesesteak with American cheese and ketchup topped with an egg sunny-side up.  While the sandwich was listed as having sriracha ketchup on it  I'm not a fan of the hot and spicy side of things  so when I asked if I could substitute regular ketchup for the sriracha  the counter girl gladly obliged.  I also ordered a small side of fries to accompany my cheesesteak.  While I waited for my order to be ready  I noticed that at each table in the shop  there is a roll of paper towels--and I can totally understand why.....so delicious yet so messy!! I also notice that they have what they call a \\5 Pound Challenge\\\"--in which participants are challenged to polish off 5 pounds of food (a 2-foot long cheesesteak  4 Philly soft pretzels  a box of Tastykakes  24 Peanut Chews  and a Cherry soda)  and if they have done so in 45 minutes or less  it's ALL free!  I could never eat that all on my own  but would love to split that with a few people!  Definitely a great idea for friends!  Can't wait to try more of their menu items including their milkshakes AND the chocolate covered bacon!\"\n",
      "I had the steak and egg  really good. Excited to go back and try the Village Turkey and the Barnyard.\n",
      "I really like the Schmeer.  I mean  really really like it.  It's just a delicious combination of tender turkey breast  provolone  spinach  sliced RED onions  roasted peppers  and a garlicky mayo on a soft  fresh yet crusty roll.  A whole sandwich will easily be enough for 2 meals.  I brought half for lunch and it was still delicious after spending a day and a half in the refrigerator  although I would recommend eating it fresh.  Dad's pick is the midtown chicken (he's trying to be healthier)  which still tastes pretty darn good and indulgent with sliced  grilled chicken  avocado spread  peppers  onions  and a mix of cheddar and mozzarella  in a salad bowl.  While I'm a bread-loving gal  the salad and bowl options are nice if you want something flavorful yet low carb.  Apparently you can also get a sandwich over fries instead of a roll if you really are looking for a heart attack.  One of these days I will work up the gusto to try that.  In the meantime  I am very much content with the sandwich options here and even more grateful to my wonderful  foodie father who actually drives down to the city just to grab a few for lunch and dinner (and bring some extras for my lunch the next day).  Definitely worth a visit if you're in Philly and want a quick  satisfying  flavorful  and affordable bite.\n",
      "I I'm in town from Arizona and my wife saw this place on tv and told me I had to go. Absolutely worth it. Ordered the garlic bomb off their \\secret\\\" menu and it did not disappoint. Well worth the trip and the service was great. They were helpful  friendly  attentive and expedient.\"\n",
      "Thank you Jake's for bringing something different to the table. The Market East options in the sandwich department tend to mirror each other so it is great to have some variety in a menu.   These sandwiches are true sandwich lover sandwiches. Great bread with fresh ingredients. I have eaten lunch in twice and the workers are very friendly and make it a casual environment. They probably eat for free all day back there so I would be a happy camper too. I have tried the Barnyard  Mensch and the Italian all of which make a great and filling lunch. All the sandwiches are $7 or $8 which isn't too bad with the quality of the products.   My only true complaint is the fries. They are pretty boring on their own and not crispy enough. I will be back soon to continue my quest to try every sandwich on the menu  minus the leaner ones section  no time for that.\n",
      "I am sad to report I have not been nearly as happy as I had been in the past. Things were not put together with care  and the meat has been dry my past couple trips. Still good  but down a peg.\n",
      "I love the garlic bomb and the pulled pork sandwich. When I lived in the Market East neighborhood  I used to visit Jake's at least once a week. The $5 pork sandwich special on Monday was very good for my grad student wallet---and very good for my tummy. Fries with special sauce on the side is a must. And the meal completes with a cup of birch beer that cools me down before another wild bite of sandwich.\n",
      "I had the Cowboy. Very tender shredded pork with grilled onions.  Amazing!  Good quality  good value.  It is also a good vibe.  I met the owner  and you can tell he's passionate about his concept.\n",
      "The pig sandwich is awesome and very reasonably priced  I try to stop here at least once a week for my pork fix. Prior to trying Jake's pig  I felt that no pork sanwich in the city could live up to the GOAT of pork from the little shack on Synder Ave.  Well  I still feel that no pork sandwich is better but Jake's is pretty close  and its not always easy to go to the little shack on Snyder but Jakes is right on the corner of where I work.  Go get the pig on a Monday and experience reverse sticker shock  they have a monday special on the pig that makes me feel like I am robbing from them.\n",
      "Really nice addition to the 'hood.  Sandwiches are served on Carangi rolls  seeded  unseeded or multigrain.  The Midtown Chicken was great  red onions  cheddar and a red pepper spread went down fast.  The Village Turkey was not as good - the meat was good but the roll kind of overwhelmed the sandwich.  Fries were hot  crispy and above average.  Sodas are \\micro-brewed\\\".  I'll definitely come back - all the ingredients were fresh and good  and it's the next best thing to a Paesano's without the real thing.\"\n",
      "Good food--loved the gnocchi with marinara the baked eggplant appetizer was very good too  The service was very slow  but despite this  I'd go back  the food is just that good\n",
      "Excellent food atmosphere and service . Everything was fresh and hot when we were served  and the dessert tray is absolutely amazing!  We walked here from our hotel ( Hotel Monaco) and are so glad we did! Bon Appetito!!\n",
      "My boyfriend and I have visited here a bunch of times and we will still be coming here! Everything has always been great! Mussels are amazing in the white and the red! Chicken Marsala is amazing! The drinks are a little to expensive  some of them being as much as your meal itself  but I guess that's because the location. Grab a drink across the street at Las Vegas lounge first to pay average price for a drink than head to an amazing dinner here!\n",
      "Its a decent place. Not the best italian food I had  but it was good. I was here for restaurant week. I had the lobster ravioli  the meatball appetizer and the brownie dessert. It was all good  nothing stood out as the best thing I have eaten. It was pricey  but I wasn't disappointed. They have a good wine list to choose from. Overall  if you are in the area I would give it a try. Its not something I would trek a long way down to eat.\n",
      "If the name of my restaurant was my last name I'd make dam sure it was good!  Well Charles LaScala shouldn't worry because this is a very good mid-level Italian restaurant.  I've been to dinner  lunch  and happy hour here all multiple times so I know my way around this place. Before I discuss the many great things about this establishment I'll mention two issues that are less than good.  First this place has an active bar with multiple TVs.  This is great for Happy Hour but not so great if you are seated near it with the intention of having a peaceful meal.  So Rule #1 is to ask to be seated away from the bar.  I've never found this to be a problem as the staff is very accommodating.  Second  in my opinion  the adult libations are generally a dollar or two too high for a mid-level Italian place.  It's very easy to order drinks here that go over $10.  So consider yourself forewarned.  So let's talk about all the positive attributes-  The location is fabulous.  It's within walking distance of Olde City  the Walnut Street Theater  the Historic District  etc.  etc.    The have a few outside tables and Chestnut Street is great for people watching.  These folks have one of the best free parking arrangements in all of Philadelphia.  That's right  I said free and the parking lot is in the same building.  If you are driving in it doesn't get any better than this. Note that free parking is available after 3 PM.    They use OpenTable so making your reservation is super convenient.  By the way  these folks do a great job during Restaurant Weeks. Make yourself a note to book early for those coveted RW seatings.  Regarding the food  expect classic Italian in large portions.  It doesn't matter if you are a carnivore  like your protein from the sea  or are of the vegetarian persuasion.  Everybody will be happy here.  Expect appetizers to be about $10 and entrées to range from the high teens to mid-twenties.   The Broccoli Rabe appetizer ($10) is to die for.  It comes with sweet Italian sausage and grilled polenta.  The lovely wife has tried the Chicken Alla Roma ($21) and pronounced it excellent.  It comes with mushrooms and asparagus in a lemon-caper sauce.  If you are in this part of town  give them a try for lunch.  I'll bet you come back for dinner.\n",
      "This was a nice spot to have an outdoor lunch.  We were staying at a hotel for the day  so liquid lunch was on the agenda. Luckily  LaScala's has a $9 wine flight which lets you sample 3 wines. Having Yards beer on tap does not hurt either!  We spent about $35 total on 2 people. One of us had the chopped salad  which was a perfect and filling lunch portion. The other ordered tuna with french fries and aragula. This dish was also very good  the tuna was cooked exactly to order. The fries were the thin kind  more flavorful but perhaps a bit less potato and a bit more oil.  Overall  we very much enjoyed our lunch here \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't get this place.  I'm going to have to steer my boss clear of it next time we dine out.  The salads are way too small  the strombolis way too big.   The salad I ordered was fine  but nothing to write home about  and definitely left me feeling hungry.  My coworker ordered an appetizer ($10) as her main  and it looked like the size of a cadbury cream egg.  If we don't want a huge calzone for lunch  and also don't want a $15 pasta dish  you need to add something to your menu that satisfies more fully  isn't a heavy chicken parm sandwich  and doesn't break the bank.  The ambience was weird  too.  They were playing like  the best hits of the 80s  90s  and today  during lunch.  And loudly  at that. The restaurant was dark  they didn't have all of the lights turned on.  Service was meh.  This is lunch  not dinner.  Set the mood accordingly!\n",
      "Great restaurant right on the cusp of the historic district in Philadelphia. Great atmosphere  nice specialty drinks  and delicious food.   Pro tip: a great bonus is that they will validate your parking at the garage next door!\n",

      "Love  love  love this place.  The staff is so friendly and fast with great customer service.  They always make me feel like a regular!  My absolute favorite spot in Philly for breakfast on the go.\n",
      "Awesome staff  great options  creative menu with a bagel of the day and a morning special. Pretty expensive  but absolutely worth it if you're feeling spendy.\n",

      "So I just moved to Society Hill after spending a combined 7 years in West  Fish  and South. And while I am loving my new digs  unlike my former neighborhoods  Society Hill sometimes feels a little too fancy for me  like I don't quite belong. That's until I became a regular at Knead.   It's basically 'Cheers' for bagels. (You guys should totally use that in your marketing.)   But seriously the bagels and different cream cheeses and sandwiches are amazing enough but the excellent customer service puts it over the top. Every morning I go there it puts a great start on my day. And as a newcomer to this neighborhood  it made me feel like I had finally made it home.   Ok enough sappy sap.   Here's what you get: 1. Fennel bagel with roasted tomato cc. Literally my favorite thing ever. You gotta get it.   2. Always try the special. If it sounds like you'd like it  try it. You miss all the bagels you don't eat. (You can use that line too.)   3. Corned beef with health salad. As someone who used to work at Famous and who is still mildly obsessed with their health salad  lemme tell you this sammie is LEGIT.   I can't even describe how much I love this place. Thank you for existing!\n",
      "Great place!  Interesting flavors  nice clean environment and friendly owners. They even gave me a few free bagels for later. I'll be back!\n",
      "I think I might have just found out how I'm going to carbo load for the Philly marathon. These might actually be the best bagels I've ever had in Philly. (I know. It's a strong assertion.)  I actually didn't get to go to the store itself  but my coworker brought a bunch in for a taste test. We got to try the Porcini  the Moroccan Spiced Apricot  the Black Sesame  and the Poppy. Seriously  these bagels are exactly what I look for - super soft and fluffy in the middle  with a nice tough exterior. (Fat kid alert.) The Moroccan Spiced Apricot was probably my favorite because it was so unique - sweet  but not too sweet (And I'm one of those people who hates sweet things mixed in with savory. So you know this was good!). I was honestly a little disappointed in the Porcini. I didn't get much of a Porcini flavor from it and we all thought it tasted more like Pumpernickel. I only got to try the plain cream cheese  but I can't wait to go back and try some of the flavored ones. (Kimchee cream cheese and Lemon Goat Cheese Spread? Yes please!)    So  in short  go to Knead. Now! Unless it's after 2 pm. Then go tomorrow.\n",
      "The service was friendly and quick.   The place has a hipster-y schtick.   But  the seating was tight   The cream cheese was just alright.  And  the bagel was hard as a brick.\n",
      "Just opened today and they're off to a great start. Fast  friendly service  great bagels and coffee. They only have the breakfast menu set up so far but I look forward to the lunch menu soon.   The wife and I tried the Fennel Seed and Sea Salt bagel with roasted tomato cream cheese. Fabulous and filling. Also had the Flax and Chia Seed bagel with red lentil hummus  which was delicious and probably a healthier choice than the other. (Couldn't help but think the tomato cream cheese would be good on the Flax and Chia Seed bagel  too.) The bagels were crisp on the outside with chewy insides  done to perfection.   Also got two of the locally roasted Elixr coffees. It's good coffee--strong and flavorful.  Nice new breakfast and coffee option for Wash West. Check 'em out.\n",
      "The spreads are unique and taste great.  The bagels taste fine but the texture is super chewy  almost hard.  People don't seem to mind--it's always super busy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Visited philly read the reviews and came to Stella rossa with high expectations and unfortunately ended up disappointed with the food. The calamari dish and cheese platter assortment were the only items with flavor. The pizza didn't flow it tasted like the vegetables were steamed in microwave placed in cheese and it was all melted on dry puffy flat bread. Beef carpaccio also had no taste. Although  the service was impeccable and ambiance was nice for a dressy casual relaxing atmosphere.\n",
      "At the Philadephia Food Expo a few weeks ago on Jefferson campus  I won a $25 gift card to go. As I was debating when to use it  they also informed me I won a free happy hour. My boyfriend and I decided to go for dinner and happy hour. Now  my free \\happy hour\\\" was not explained well in the slightest. (Since then  I had won another one  and the details were more well explained). Due to the confusion  the manager was more than accommodating for my 9 happy hour friends (even allowing my alcohol-free friend to get half-priced apps even though she didn't pay for a package). Drink selection was decent and we made our money worth it for the alcohol!   Boyfriend and I also had dinner before hand. The servers were attentive and had excellent mannerisms. Our bread and oil came out quickly - it was a foccacia-herb type loaf with excellent flavoring. I ordered the Cavatelli Tartufo while he ordered the Rigatoni Pizzaioli. The flavoring was rich without being overpowering or too heavy. The portion sizes were generous for the price. I would definitely return again.\"\n",
      "Food was just Ok  nothing special here and I wouldn't go back again. However  Nothing was bad - the service was great  fun atmosphere (although it was very Maggiano's-esque)  and the food was nicely portioned. We shared the meatball appetizer  Caesar salad  and the chicken Parmesan. Everything was good  but again  nothing special. Philly is world-renowned for some of the best Italian restaurants in the world  don't sell yourself short by coming here if you are seeking good Italian in Philly. There are plenty other restaurants to choose from!\n",
      "I'm from about an hour outside of Philly  but whenever I'm in the area  Barra Rossa is my first pick for dinner (and there's a Cheesecake Factory nearby!). It's great for any occasion  because prices range from impromptu night out for two to celebratory dinner for twelve. Speaking of large parties  the restaurant is very accommodating for big groups with and even without reservations (depending on the time). The two-story restaurant has its own unique ambiance on its street corner  making it as attractive inside as it is out.\n",
      "Went this afternoon for a late lunch despite the pouring rain  so glad that we did. I received an Open Table gift cert for the holidays and redeemed it here since its close and its a new restaurant  the braised meatballs app was delicious  the pizza and rigatoni were also really good. Had a few Dogfish's as well  which are always great. The service was very good  nicely paced since we weren't in a rush  and our server  Greg  was attentive and very nice  even though it seemed he was busy at times. We look forward to returning and trying some new things  but we definitely NEED those meatballs again! :)\n",
      "\n",
      "The mixed reviews here are surprising but I guess you're talking Philly so there's a lot to consider there....  I've dined here twice and enjoyed it both times. The meat/cheese/olive plate is adequate. Had several different pizzas all great. Rice balls blew me away  which j was not expecting. Sangria is delicious. In terms of service in a small dining situation everyone was friendly and in a large dining situation they easily accommodated a large bachelorette party somewhat last minute and dealt with some of the shenanigans associated gracefully. I would not hesitate to return.\n",
      "Very good experience.  Sat at the bar and enjoyed some wine and tortellini.  Bartender was great  food was very good  for a limited wine menu there were still some nice choices.  Would definitely recommend.\n",
      "We were disappointed with dinner at Barra Rossa. The Panzenella salad was okay  but my filet mignon entree was not worth the $30 price tag  I ordered it medium to medium well  but got a very charred piece of meat. My husband's salmon was edible  but not very fresh or tasty. My cappuccino was lukewarm and topped with \\steamed' milk that was actually cool. The desserts in their selection (small dessert cups of various concoctions) all looked exactly alike except for their color. We shared the chocolate hazelnut one  which tasted fine but was nothing special. To top it all off  while I wasn't looking the waitress whisked away a glass of wine which I hadn't yet finished drinking. Don't think we'll be back.\"\n",
      "I hate this store  it is what it is.  It's overpriced cheaply made furniture that you have to shop for  cart  tote  and assemble yourself.  The price for a bedroom set or anything other than one piece adds up so quickly that you're better off going to a furniture store and getting real wood.  I think if people took time to compare the price of real furniture that could last a lifetime compared to the pressed particle board that so easily bends  breaks  tears  etc.  there would be no hesitation to buy better stuff.  Ashley or another reasonably priced furniture retailer should open up next door.  Also  every employee seemed miserable  which added to my own misery in this warehouse of crap.\n",
      "Over the past decade I've been to Ikea stores in four different states. I know what to expect at this point. I willingly embrace the particle board furniture  maze-like store layouts  and trying to wrestle giant boxes of flat-packed furniture onto a cart.   But until today  I didn't know a trip to Ikea could be this miserable. I realized I've taken the blue and yellow homogeneity of other stores for granted.  At 5:30 PM on a Wednesday  the South Philly Ikea felt strangely similar to a Wal*Mart at 2am. Their \\marketplace\\\" area is under construction  but that doesn't explain why the few marketplace items that were available were arranged in no discernible groups and strewn about like a small tornado had just come through. Many of the items in the self-service pickup area were unavailable - not because they were actually out of stock  but because no one had bothered to bring any down from the higher shelves. Pallet trucks blocked the aisles  but weren't actually being used. We were only able to find about 3/4 of the stuff we had planned to buy.  When we went to checkout we were informed that the line was closing and that we should get in another line. Except that there weren't any others open - just those infernal \\\"15 items or less\\\" self checkout machines - and we had two carts piled full of unwieldy furniture. Apparently it was time for the cashier's legally mandated break. Why no one had planned for this eventuality is beyond me  but after standing around for 10 minutes they managed to find someone else to open a register rather than funnel everyone in the store through the self check-out area.   On a positive note  the gentleman who did ring us up was quick and friendly  and scheduling delivery was pretty painless.  But overall this is the most depressing Ikea I've ever been to  and I'm sticking to the one out in Consohocken from now on.\"\n",
      "I have been usually pleased with the food court at IKEA   but recently they have made some changes . They no longer serve Lingonberry juice from the fountain. You have to buy a single serving. Why the Change? The cashier was even rude. I asked about my rewards cards and asked if he would accept a phone # while he was ringing me up . The food item had a discount . When I asked him again .  He shorted \\ You have to have it with you \\\" i was surprised at the tone of an Ikea Employee. I am so disappointed.  First time I had a bad experience.\"\n",
      "I've been to a dozen or so Ikea locations up and down the east coast. One thing is for sure  one is not better than the rest.  They all offer the same stock  are about the same size  and have the same set up - displays upstairs  inventory downstairs.  In the 20 + years I've been a customer it's been a love/hate affair.  LOVE the displays providing room design ideas  the multiple ways they use the same pieces  and the fact that you can see and feel how each piece functions.  Love the options and choices.  Love the prices and abundance of inventory  the way things are packed to make transporting home in a car easy.  Love that they also have Swedish food to eat there or take home prepackaged.  HATE the return process (if you can even get them to take something back)  the hunt for the merchandise on your list  the complex assembly with limited instructions.  Hate the poor quality and the fact that inventory and parts change often and chances are if something breaks you can't get replacement parts.  Hate the long lines that are present at every location  the lack of help loading.  Hate that you have to buy their bag if you want your items bagged.  One thing I have discovered is even if you scour the catalog for days on end  make a list and check it twice once you get to the store all will change.  You'll see a piece in a display different from the catalog and fall in love  or the opposite - you'll see the piece you came for and the display isn't how you envisioned.  Either way sometimes too many choices equal too much frustration.  This coming from a woman that once packed up my car  measured the space remaining  and went back and purchased more.  That drove home two hours down the turnpike smack dab against the windshield because the driver's seat held not only myself but a box.  Or that I once loaded my car so full I couldn't even see my children.  Yes  all this has happened and happens all the time.  If you want a good comical reality experience just sit in the parking lot and watch people load for a few hours....  Overall as I aged so did my style.  While the catalog and displays are nice  rarely if ever does that same piece look like that in my own home.  My daughter's bedroom was entirely Ikea and in less than a year we had to do multiple repairs on our own.  Drawer bottoms are week  side rails are plastic  beds and dressers are no more than particleboard wrapped in a laminate skin.  Wheels on trundle beds are undersized and the design faulty.  What works for the Swedes unfortunately doesn't work for American children.  As a middle aged woman I now come for the inspiration.  For ideas that I can take home and rework with more structurally sound pieces.  I come for the accessories  the candles in bulk  and the furniture pieces that are inexpensive and will only get occasional use.  I come for the unique - things that can only be found at Ikea.  For a day browsing with girlfriends or killing time in a vacation location.  So this love  affair for the most part is over  or maybe just categorized to friends with benefits.\n",
      "Ok who doesnt like Ikea! I furnished my new apartment with all things ikea  its so affordable and chic its crazy! I now have a white fabric couch and wont be too upset if anything happens to it since it was such a good price and the covers are washable! They have a flat $99 for delivering (straight into whatever room you want) which is really good if you buy multiple big pieces all at once. For the smaller stuff I just went in the store and drove them back home. Their wooden cubes for storage is amazing and so versatile! As is basically everything else.. ok I just love this place!\n",
      "Alright  I felt the need to write a little update from a positive side...  My fiance and I went here last week for a \\Save the SS United\\\" presentation.  If you're not sure what the SS United is  it's the rusting Titanic across the street.  Since my fiance is writing her thesis on the ship  we felt like it was a good event to go to... not to mention that it was catered by Ikea and all I could think of was unlimited Swedish meatballs.  It was exactly that  but more.  To my surprise  they did one hell of a job hosting/catering this event.  The venue was perfect because as they did slide shows and such about the ship  it was sitting in the water right across the street.  In addition to that  Ikea now has SS United awareness stickers on the window - two points for community outreach!  I'm getting off track - the food was great and plenty of it  the event was cool and spacious and I was thoroughly impressed.  4 stars because I still have issues with returns department...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the first IKEA I've ever been to  and it's pretty awesome. I just come here to organize my place more and get inspired by their sleek  fancy designs.   The top floor is the show room and the bottom is where you can actually shop and throw items in your cart or trolley. You can also get a tasty meal on the top floor  and I recommend their traditional Swedish meatballs!  If you see a short Caucasian woman walking around with a look of wonder on her face  that's probably me  walking around for fun. Haha.\n",
      "It's Ikea  I mean  they've perfected the process of finding the cheapest most mass-produced crap that is both palatable yet slightly unsatisfying to almost everyone equally. I'm not really sure at this point if I'm reviewing the food or the furniture  yet. Hmm  I used the word \\palatable \\\" I guess I'll go with the food.  So  yeah  it's Ikea. If you've eaten at one  they're all the same. Their cafeteria is best during school hours on school days (to avoid the herds of screaming children barely controlled by their parents) which is coincidentally  the only good time to shop for pressboard (oops  I mean furniture). I've had both breakfast and lunch  and neither were spectacular  but it filled the belly  thus achieving my purpose.  The most unique part of the dining experience is being able to sit and look out at the decaying SS United States on the Delaware. Or explaining to my wife why they don't have underground parking like every other Ikea (psst  it has something to do with the water level that close to the river.)\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I came here on a Thursday evening to celebrate my birthday. I'd been wanting to try Bibou for ages  and my birthday seemed like an opportune time.   We were seated at the worst table in the restaurant (2-top in the middle of the middle row). The noise level was really high and I had trouble conversing with my husband until the tables next to us left.  Service was really solid  but I found the food underwhelming -- perhaps because I'd built it up too much in my mind. Nothing was bad  and presentation was nice  but not a single thing really wowed me.  In fact  I would say the half-dozen raw oysters were the highlight of the meal. Chestnut soup  foie gras  squab  and whatever other main course we had were less than memorable.  I would come back here to try the $45 Sunday prix fixe  but I'll stick with other BYOBs where it's easier to get a reservation on short notice.\n",
      "It's been a few months since I had my first and only meal here  but I'll try to post what I can remember: simple but nice decor  tight seating  charming hostess  nice wait staff  and wonderfully tasty food!   Whenever I dine at a place that is supposed to be top notch (and the early reviews ofthis place indicated that it was)  I try to get the things on the menu that I'd be most terrified to try to cook myself. Hence it was a night of tripe and pig's foot for me! Yum  feet and guts!  I have to say though  it was all pretty amazing. The tripe was prepared in a sauce that you could put old tires in and have them come out tasting amazing. The pig's foot was stuffed with (I think) foie gras  and it just fell apart in meaty  fatty  savory goodness. Do not eat here if you are on any kind of diet. It will make you fat.  It will also make you happy though. So you may want to ask yourself  do I want to be thin or do I want to be happy? If you want to be happy (and perhaps a little more portly than you started) check out Bibou.   It was perhaps the best under $100 (for 2) meal I've ever had.\n",
      "This is my first time at this restaurant. I made a reservation for Sunday approximately a month in advance through open table (which you should try 6 weeks ahead).  I was celebrating my anniversary with my fiancé and made a note with them. We arrived  greeted by friendly hostess  seated in the middle closest to the kitchen. The place is a row home  it's tight. We were greeted by a great server  he was french and spoke great english. We brought wine  it was opened and poured for us with a lot of professional attitude. We came on Sunday  ordered the $45 prefix menu. First course was mushroom soup  absolutely perfect. Second course was fois gras  it's like the most tender ribeye fat but better. Third was duck confit  reminiscent of my time in Paris. Not dry  in a great sauce with vegetables. My fiancee has short ribs  which was in a light broth sauce that needed a bit of salt  otherwise light and perfect. Desert course was sorbet which was light and refreshing. I mentioned my anniversary in my reservation and the host was happy to bring a complimentary merang and macaroon. The chef made rounds and spoke with us  wonderful guy who clearly cares about the food.  We also brought our own wine and it was poured like our time in France. We weren't rushed or felt inconvenienced. If you have a special event or want a great date night  choose this place. 2 person prefix menu on Sunday without extras including tip was $115  but absolutely worth it. We will be back soon.\n",
      "So  I finally had dinner at Bibou after a few of my friends had suggested that I should go here.  I understand the appeal  and we had a nice meal  but there were a few misses. We started with three appetizers to share.  The foie gras with a date jam  the escargots  and a special chicken liver mousse.  The foie gras and the mousse were very good and we enjoyed them both.  The escargots with some brown sauce  nuts  and beans were not so good.   Then came the main course and we had the famous/infamous pig's foot stuffed with foie gras over lentils and a special red snapper cooked in parchment.  The pig's foot was very good and I was pleased since this came highly recommended.  The snapper was also very good  moist  tasty  but the vegetables which accompanied the fish did not seem to go very well. Then came dessert  a frozen Grand Marnier souffle and a pistachio creme something.  We ended up not finishing the souffle  as we were both stuffed.  Some espresso and some macaroons from the chef and we were all done. The staff was pleasant and polite and genuinely helpful.   Upon leaving  we both agreed that we had a nice meal  but the missus did say that the wine we brought outclassed the meal quite seriously.  I agree with her.  In truth  I have had quite a few rustic-type French meals in all sorts of different places and this was good  but not amazing as I had been led to believe.  Would I recommend?  Yes.  Would I recommend over other places in Philly for a great meal and experience?  Probably not.\n",
      "Really hard to say enough good things about Bibou.  It is all that everyone is saying about it.  Phenomenal food  charming staff/ambience  and all things considered absolutely excellent value.  I have been in Philadelphia for about a year and a half and spend a frightening amount of time and resources eating out.  In this time I have had two seminal experiences in fine dining.  Vetri and Bibou. Vetri was fantastic  a tour de force  and cost my benefactor about $500 for dinner for two.  Bibou was as good of its kind food-wise and cost $120 for two (though to be fair only two courses plus dessert as opposed to a grand tasting menu).  Highlights of the meal:  The escargot  a different preparation as the snails are out of their shells and come in a sort of provencal sauce.  However  they do saute them in garlic and butter so it gives you what you are looking for on that front with some interesting additions.  Foie Gras  huge portion perfectly cooked.  Marrow (special that night)  a full bone sliced lengthwise filled with mushrooms and breadcrumbs so that the marrow more or less melts into them.  One of the best dishes I have ever had.  We strongly considered trying to move into the apartment above bibou so that we could go there everyday.  If you are even remotely serious about food this needs to be your next destination!\n",
      "Bibou had to live up to high expectations  and they did not disappoint. The menu changes  but I would recommend the tasting menu  which you can get upon request even if you don't sit at the bar. A bonus to the tasting menu was that for many of the courses they gave my husband and I different things  allowing us to sample more if the menu.\n",
      "Finally managed to snag a Sunday pre-fixe reservation at Bibou! They offer a great deal - 4 courses for $45 every Sunday. Note: this is not the same as the Chef's Tasting menu  which is only at the bar and is 7 courses.  I came in a group of 3  and when we got there at 7 pm  the place was relatively packed. It was a cosy restaurant  but not too the extent that tables were so close together that you hear your neighbors' conversations. We were warmly welcomed by the server and our waiter - you will be delighted to know that many waiters there are French (and all are extremely knowledgeable about the food!).  First  we were served with some baguette and butter. Many people rave about the butter  I thought it was delicious but not out of this world. Having said that  the butter was creamy and was great on the fresh baguette. My tip would be to leave the butter out for a bit  so it is a little easier to spread.   We all started with the Soupe de Champignon  which is a mushroom cream soup. The soup is served in a beautiful oval bowl (which is shaped more like a gravy boat). I loved the texture / creaminess of the soup  and the crispy croutons which didn't lose much of its crunch even in the soup.   Next  we had our entrees. My friends got the escargots (very fresh  love the mushrooms and the snail shaped plate the escargots were served in) and the pate. I got the Duo de Foie Gras  which I highly recommend. According to our server  it is \\the best Foie Gras in Philly.\\\" The foie gras was seared to perfection  and it just melted in my mouth. I may not be an expert on foie gras in Philly  but I would definitely agree with my waiter - it might be the best foie gras I've had so far!  On to the plats principaux. Both my friends got the Thon (grilled Albacore tuna loin  one served rare and the other medium rare. They said it was very fresh and enjoyed it). I ordered the Long Island Duck Confit. The skin of the duck was very crispy and well done  never mind about how skin is unhealthy or fatty - it was worth every calorie!   For the desserts  my friends got the floating island and frozen hazelnut souffle  while I got the chocolate pot de creme. All three were sweet but not overly sickly so. I enjoyed them immensely. To end  we were also served coconut macarons and eggnog meringues.  I enjoyed my whole experience at Bibou  from the food  to the service  to the ambiance. I strongly recommend making a trip down  especially for the Sunday pre-fixe!\"\n",
      "Fine French dining in South Philly that is BYOB. Other reviews state \\cash only\\\" which is not true. We went here for date night and it was an all around good experience. The wait staff was friendly and the food was excellent. At the end of the night we were even greater by Chef Calmels. The menu was $115 prix fixe with several stars in my opinion:   1) Marinated scallop with smoked truffle vinaigrette  2) Aged NY strip 3) Tarentaise \\\"aligot\\\" 4) Hot fig soufflé\"\n",
      "Loved this place! We went last night with two \\special occasion\\\" bottles in tow. I started with the escargot and certainly understand why it is a signature dish. Lovely bordelaise sauce  tender favas  and the sweetest hint of tarragon. My dining companion had oysters which looked wonderful but I did not taste. For entrees I got the pig's foot - OMG total decadence and absolutely wonderful. If you love pork belly then this you'd love this dish - if you think pork belly is fatty then you should steer clear. My friend got the sea bass which while quite good  was not comparable to my dish. That said  if you love fish  there was a terrific saffron sauce that complemented the sea bass - it was creamy  earthy - really quite good. We finished by sharing a cheese plate and the promise to return to try chef's tasting.  Speaking of chef  he came by and greeted every table. Wonderful detail that i'm sure endears him to the regular patrons. His wife is equally affable running the front of house.  So glad we were patient enough to get reservations.\"\n",
      "Where do I begin? Moonstruck has my heart. &pizza is so convenient  quick and affordable. Never had any bad pizza there at all. Love the soda too!\n",
      "Fantastic pizza  great service  and tasty organic sodas make this new age pizza shop worth the stop! They serve thin crust flatbread style pizzas with the freshest ingredients I've ever had on a pizza. You can choose a pizza from their menu and then customize it to your liking. I highly recommend the Maverick with the spicy tomatoe sauce and the Hawaiian just the way it is. Make sure you get a taste of the soda. It is homemade with cane sugar and out of this world. We will be sure to stop by again.\n",
      "Amazing pizza for the cost and unlimited toppings. Super friendly service and delicious eats.  My only complaint was the music was extremely loud.  Very happy that they had the note on their website that the entrance was on 15th street - we almost missed it and thought it was one of the closed down buildings on Walnut.  Edited to Clarify:  We were hungover  so we might have been a bit sensitive to the music level.  Will definitely still recommend this place to everyone we know in Philly!\n",
      "I love this place. I lived in DC where &pizza was at and I got so excited when I found out they were coming to Philly. I hope they expand and open other locations. Build your own pizza is my favorite and I love how it fills me up but the thin crust doesn't make you feel too full. Also  I know &pizza used to do good for the community and for nonprofits in DC so I'm looking forward to them doing good things here too.\n",
      "I heard about this place through word of mouth. I ordered a Moonstruck online and went to pick it up at 1430 Walnut street and there is nothing there. I called and they are actually located on 15th street between Walnut and Chancellor. The pizza is tasty  but I don't know how they expect people to find them at this address.\n",
      "Stumbled in here yesterday for a quick bite and I must say  it was phenomenal. Not sure what was better the service or the food.  We were greeted upon entering the restaurant  offered food recommendations and even had the manager stop by to ensure our experience met their expectations. We cannot wait to stop back out and try the rest of the menu  but the \\MOONSTRUCK\\\" and the \\\"AMERICAN HONEY\\\" were absolutely outstanding!  Definitely should check it out!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm very particular about my pizza  probably slightly less than a New Yorker  but this was great. You can add as many toppings as you like  but be sure to grab a fork because they'll fall off.   I made my own (traditional dough  classic tomato sauce  fresh mozzarella  grilled onion  mushroom  spinach  and chicken with parmesan and balsamic finishes). Everything tastes fresh  and it was really good. The edges of the crust were crunchy  but not rock hard  but the center of the crust under the topping was soft. The toppings fall off easily if you're not careful. Good thing they have forks!   I had a sweet mint \\&tea \\\" and it wasn't too sweet. They come in jars  which I thought was a little odd at first  but didn't really mind.  The only downside (reason it's not five stars) is the value for how much food you get. A pizza and iced tea were $13.75  but I left a little hungry. This doesn't happen at some other places you can get a meal for $13-15 at. The pizza was great  dough.\"\n",

      "Koreana is delicious. Food and service are both great.  When I come here I get their D11 or wings  both are great and under $10.  Could be in a better location  as eating outside can smell bad in the summer.\n",
      "There's something to be said about a former worker  who still CRAVES this food. I worked at Koreana years ago. Some of the nicest and caring bosses ever!....but you're here to hear about the food.  You'd think seeing the same food over and over again would make you really sick of that food. You ALWAYS smell like onion and garlic after work...god forbid if you couldn't hit the shower right away. (I felt so bad for my classmates  who had to sit next to me whenever I had to rush to class right after work.)  I admit  I was \\sick\\\" of the food about a year in. But then I had a two week vacation...and the cravings set right back in. As a worker  I gained 40 lbs from the beginning of working there to 2 years later. TT TT (Thankfully  I'll lost a lot of that weight since...)  To this day  I still crave the food!! That's how good it is. Hell  I'm about head there now for lunch. I honestly went through the entire menu in my head (I still remember it by heart...yea  my fiancé shook his head at this part) and tried to think of ANY of the dishes that I disliked...and there isn't any. (No joke.)  BUT I do have some favorites! To this day  their soy chicken is the bomb! The sauce is to die for! I wish they sold that supermarkets. The kimbap  too... I could nom on those all day long. I also LOVE the japchae (esp with rice  don't calorie count) - sweet potato noodles hold a special place in my heart. Bibimbap: The vegetables are crisp and that gochujang sauce is something (it's spicy but not crazy spicy  sweet  and tangy). In general  I just LOVE Koreana's seasonings. I won't let you in on the secret  but I can promise you this: no MSG.  Tip: Something that I always forget myself until I'm sweating bullets and my taste buds have already gone numb. Unless you just LOVE spicy foods  ask for 'mild' when you order dokbokki! Allow yourself to enjoy the flavors.....without dying. Maybe I'm just a wimp.  I held back from reviewing because I didn't feel it was right doing so as a worker  but two years removed now  I thought why not. I really do enjoy the food.  Hi old bosses  if you're reading this! Hahahah.............. we're going to pretend this never happened. Bye now!\"\n",
      "Soup is great and service is usually prompt. Some of the food isn't great but if you pick the right things (bim bim bap) then you will enjoy it. For the amount of food  it is a good deal.\n",
      "Best Korean food ever.  Everything is so good.  We always get kimchi fried rice with duk bokki and yuk geh jjang or yuk gal tang.  This is crack.  You know a restaurant is good  when I always order 2 or 3 meals.    Oh yeah.  And they're so friendly and kind.  And food comes out so fast when they're not busy!!!!  Even when they're packed I'm so shocked how food comes out fast. Customer service has always been great!!!\n",
      "It's always great when there's a strong aroma in this little Korean joint. The place sells fairly cheap korean food! And the cuisine itself is already so lovely with great portions. I'm so obsessed with getting takeouts or grabbing a lunch dinner here. The kimbap  kimchi stew  smoothies  and rice cakes are wonderful picks! The owner is very nice too. He's awesome  same goes for all of the nice workers.\n",
      "If you want quick  relatively cheap Korean food in UC this is a good option. However  there are not many Korean food options in Unviersity City to begin with...\n",
      "This is definitely not count as good Korean food I had  except their fried chicken. I tried not to think about calories when I eat them because the sauce is very good.   A popular spot in university city for students l  but if you want some nice Korean food  city center is a better option.\n",
      "Visit Dates: 03.05-03.06.2010  I was in town for ECAASU  and my local friends refriended Koreana. It's easy to miss this place as you're walking along Chestnut St.  since the restaurant front doesn't face outward toward the street. The outward appearance is also a bit nondescript and bland.  Once inside  I ordered the dak galbi (Korean bbq-ed chicken) bento box. It also includes mandu (korean dumplings)  kimbap (korean sushi)  kimchi  miso soup  and a salad. A lot of food for about $10. The dak galbi was delicious  though service was a bit slow because of all the orders during that day  so my order arrived late at my table.  And since I enjoyed my dinner  I came back for lunch the next day  and ordered the beef galbi bento box this time around. The beef wasn't as good as the chicken galbi  nonetheless it was still good food.\n",
      "As a pseudo-vegetarian deathfully afraid of slimy and unknown meats  I had always assumed that I had few Korean choices.  Koreana  you broadened my world! Not only do they make a mean hot pot bibimbop but they make a handful of other dishes vegetarian.  Some are a bit greasy  but this makes for good brain food.    If you're in the mood for a sugar bomb at the end  try the tapioca dish.  It's a mix of red beans  tapioca  syrupy fruit  and various unidentifiable sugar items.    P.S. They are closed on Mondays.\n",
      "Up until the past ~6 months or so  Koreana was my go-to place  I ordered nearly 1x/week and looked forward to bringing friends to try it  etc. Their spicy dishes were great  the food was cheap  and it was close to campus. What's wrong with that?  Unfortunately (and trust me  it took a lot for me to get to this point)  the quality has been steadily declining. My favorite dish has gone from 1/20 times being a little 'off' to tasting worse every time I order it. I took a friend two weeks ago who declared her food inedible  another a month and a half ago said the meat in her dish was \\verging on gross\\\" but I ignored all these signals. My love for Koreana was so strong and deep  I kept thinking it was just an off day  but now I have to admit it's not as good as it used to be.   Anyway  I don't think Koreana is bad for dinner with the other food options on Penn's campus...there's definitely worse out there. But in terms of lunch  there's more than a couple of food trucks I would much rather go to than Koreana again.\"\n",
      "One of my regular places when I was living in Philly  and I try to stop in whenever I'm back in town. Friendly service  decent food -- breakfast is especially good -- and the price can't be beat. It can get quite crowded on weekends  but if you go during less crowded times  they are happy to let you sit a while to chat with friend  hold a casual business meeting  or get a little work done.\n",
      "You're gonna walk in and be like \\woah awesome!\\\" About this place  but the food will bring you back to the soul crushing realization that you're really just at a diner.\"\n",
      "I have never had anything other than breakfasts here  but I'm a huge fan of diner breakfasts. I like to go with the \\Mt. Airy\\\": two eggs  some bacon  toast  and home fries. Oh  and coffee and juice. All at a reasonable price. I can't speak for the rest of the menu (which is huge) because I'm a breakfast-all-day kind of girl when I go to a diner.  I've always had good service and not too long of a wait  as I tend to go on weekday mornings. I enjoy the retro look of the new menu  and the fact that there is a deli and a six pack shop inside. A nice place to have in your neighborhood.\"\n",
      "I have been going to Trolley car for 8 years since first moving to Philadelphia. It is a fantastic restaurant. Great food  great service  great atmosphere. A must see in the Chestnut Hill area.\n",
      "We have been going to the diner for many years. It has some of the best diner food around but very pricey. Although I still go  we are appalled at how dirty and grimy its become. The floor is disgusting  especially under the tables. The rug in the other section smells really bad and looks dirty. The whole diner needs a major cleaning.  Its time to clean up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great place for a family breakfast. The staff is friendly and the service is fast. Food is very good  home style.  Pancakes are light and fluffy   eggs cooked just right. We had a great experience and would recommend this place.\n",
      "I love fish and grits and eggs easy over!!  I googled best grits in Philly and the top 4 were the 3 Green Eggs Cafes and The Trolley Car Diner. I have for a couple of years been convinced that the Green Eggs Cafes have the best grits I have ever had. So it was a no-brainer that I had to come here.   I order the cornmeal crusted catfish and both of their grits--plain and white cheddar and had it with two eggs easy over. It camewith toast which was mostly overkill. The eggs were cooked absolutely to perfection!  I was very disappointed with the fish. The fish itself was fresh and tasty but the essential corn meal crust was moverseasoned in a way I found very disturbing. Some might enjoy the herbs in the crust but they completely took away from the purpose. Not peppery at all and not really salty enough (and I have a sensitive salt pallet that is easily overwhelmed). Now onto the grits. The plain grits could only crack a top ten list in a northern city. The white cheddar grits were good  but were reliant on the yolk of the egg to truly pass the muster. A proper corn meal crust would have aided to the grits as well  but that was unfortunately lacking. I rationed the eggs to get through the generous portion of grits  which made the meal far closer to my liking.   The waitress was great. And she was immediately willing to indulge me my need for some of each grits.   I came in with high expectations  what with their grits being sandwiched between the three Green Eggs Cafes and all in this top 15 list I saw.   High expectations aside  I would have been disappointed by the corn meal crust and the good not great white cheddar grits. I am very glad I did not only order the plain grits.   Now for the crazy thing about this place--They have a list of 400 very well priced beers!  A pretty impressive list separated into Domestic  European  Canadian  Belgian  Mexico/South America  Local Craft  Northeast Craft  Midwest Craft  West Coast Craft  and Southern Craft beers and a few Gluten free beers flavored beverages like ciders and two non-alcoholic beers as well. But they close at 9pm and 10pm on Friday and Saturday  so get your tasting in early!\n",
      "I went here with my father today and I liked what I got - the Roast Turkey Dinner. I wanted to get it with a baked potato and carrot + celery sticks but apparently they don't start making the baked potatoes until 3 PM or so. I found it a little weird  but not a huge deal  so I went with the mashed potatoes instead.  They put the gravy on the side instead of drowning the turkey in it  which I thought was kind of neat since I had gone to another diner (Four Seasons) and they pretty much drowned the turkey in gravy.  They gave me an extremely generous portion of ranch dressing for the carrots and celery. It seemed somewhat wasteful to me - I think they gave me the same amount of dressing as they did turkey gravy. Maybe it was a mistake.  Also they have mint chocolate chip milkshakes  which to me is a rarity since most places only seem to have vanilla  chocolate  and occasionally strawberry. I guess it's possible this flavor is more common in 40s/50s inspired diners. I don't go to enough of them to know for sure.\n",
      "This is one of the better diners that I've been to in the area. The club sandwich that I got was on point. Delish! The fries are excellent. My girlfriend got a Cuban sandwich with low expectations since we just moved from Miami & it was surprisingly really  really close to the real thing. The parking lot isn't abundant but there is plenty of room to make a creative parking spot. Unfortunately  you don't actually eat in the diner but in the restaurant adjacent to the diner. We also ordered Asian donuts which were very good but the sauce was very watery. That didn't stop me from eating it though! Expect to pay approx $15 pp for your meal.\n",
      "A typical American diner in a very busy part of town. But this is a good thing. Sometimes you don't want to the upscale or trendy meal. Sometimes you just want a simple homecooked-like meal where you can forget about the bustling busyness of urban life and just relax for a bit in a cozy corner.   The wait time on a Sunday morning at 10am was typical but they sat the 7 of us at two tables near enough that we could chat and fast enough that we didn't get annoyed. The service was fast and very good  the waitress knew what was on the menu and suggested what turned out to be a delicious Breakfast Burrito.   The potatoes that came with breakfast are some of the best I've ever had! They were crispy but not burned  the seasoning was delicious  and they were not oily at all unlike a lot of hash-browns that I've had. (for clarification these aren't hash-browns  these are actual cubes of potatoes)  I would go back just for the burrito.  Edit 1 year later: I came back for the burrito and it was as delicious as I remember.\n",
      "does PA have a 'no breakfast after noon' rule?  the two of us ordered eggs  toast  and sausage and nothing else. the table of 8 orders lunch and got their food first! by the time my eggs arrived they were cold and disgusting  my b/fs eggs were piping hot!   no love  no tip..\n",
      "Definitely diner food but not as greasy as most diners. I liked the smaller portions  as most restaurants serve portions that are ridiculously large. Nice atmosphere for a family breakfast and service was good.\n",
      "I had lunch there with a friend a few months ago and we both thought it was pretty bad. But today my husband and I gave it another chance. It was even worse. I had a BLT--hard to mess up but it was dry  with over cooked bacon and a couple of leaves of Lettuce. My husband had a biscuit with gravy and sausage. The gravy congealed like wallpaper paste. We won't be going back anytime soon. Disappointing because it used to be so good!\n",
      "I don't normally leave a sub-par review based on service. This is a case where it took 20 minutes for our very nice waitress to bring out the wrong order. She did try to correct it  but I was already late for work and had to leave. Our waitress compensated by giving me a free cup of coffee.\n",
      "The people pu-pu-ing this place need to remember  you shouldn't go to a place called \\Down Home Diner\\\" and expect Haute cuisine. I've gone to this place off and on since I was a kid  and their food has always been solid and tasty. I especially recommend the Sawmill Gravy and Biscuits.   (Although I do agree that the uniforms  a fairly recent development  are ridiculous.)\"\n",
      "Service positive waitress Karen was super friendly took a bit longer than expected  pumpkin pancakes were yummy  biscuits were dry  location was\n",
      "Yuck  don't eat here. I was in Philadelphia on new Year's day and this was the only place open near the hotel. The eggs were way too runny  all of the vegetables were slimy and the food was overall just bad. The service was OK but when I got the bill the prices on the menu and what I was charged were completely different. I wouldn't eat here again if they paid me  sorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the only diner open that was close to the hotel. This placed sucked. The eggs were runny. The grits werent cooked all the way and were cold with dry shredded cheese on top. The asparagus On the omelette tasted like it came out of the can. The biscuit was dry and hard and the coffee was watered down. The only thing they didnt fuck up was the home fries which they threw in the deep fryer. I barely ate my food and the prices were way off. Who prices something as 7.17 if it was advertised as 5.99. The prices didnt make sense but we didnt want to be negative on New Years  But never again. Excuse me for the profanity but I have to keep it real. Service could have been better as well.\n",
      "What started off as a search for drunk food ended thankfully at this amazing location. In addition the staff was extremely friendly!  I had a Keema roll  a Masala roll  and a mango lassi. The keema roll had a little less spice than the masala roll  but both were equally delicious. Whereas the mango lassi was a refreshing beverage to have in between flavorful bites.  I will definitely be back.\n",
      "Delicious food  perfect for a quick bite (and late night munchies)! Masala Kitchen serves a variety of kati rolls for around $5 each  as well as some rice platter choices. Love  love the flavors of the kati rolls - it's kinda like a wrap so it's portable (although I did make a mess eating it  I think it's just me) with delicious fillings inside  ranging from vegetarian options to chicken to lamb. One kati roll is good for a lunch (although might wanna get more if you're starving)! Service is really friendly and food came out pretty quickly. The store has plenty of seating for a quick bite. I also ordered the mango lassi - it came in a small plastic bottle and was really creamy! It was very thick though - I think I prefer it to be a tad less so  but that's just my personal preference.\n",
      "Loved the food here. The staff is friendly  small and cozy place. The katti rolls and platters are a class apart. If your in Philadelphia you have to eat here!\n",
      "We had just gotten into Philadelphia and made our way to our Airbnb. After checking in we dropped our bags and ran out the door because we were so hungry. Across the street was this place and we bolted for it not knowing what we were getting into. After ordering two items we bolted back across the street to our Airbnb. Bed  Netflix  forks ready  opened up the food and ate. and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delicious food  large portions  good price  and fast service.   This is a great place for take out or a quick and casual lunch.  I definitely enjoyed the rose lassi  and would go back for another one if I weren't out of state!\n",
      "Stopped in today to pick up lunch and really enjoyed the food there. I had the Paneer Masala Kati roll and the vegetable Biryani. The Paneer Masala roll was very tasty and they did not skimp on the paneer! The vegetable Biryani was delicious and had just enough spice to it. They give you a nice serving of the Biryani for the price and I'll be saving more than half for another meal.   They offer up two sauces to accompany your dishes. One is a white sauce that I thought was going to be similar to Raita but turns out it was very mayo based. I really would have rather had Raita but it's free so I don't want to complain too much about it. It would definitely help cool down some of the spice.   Also  I was a little disappointed to find that they served me pita bread instead of naan. It was good fluffy pita bread but I'd much rather have naan with their food.   I will definitely go back as it's super close to my office and very tasty. It's nice having a quick take out place to go when I have a craving Indian food. Also  the staff were friendly and pleasant so go check it out.\n",
      "This place is great! Rose lassi!?! Genius!  The important thing is to consider this place to be a fast food type restaurant. Either grab n go or sit down and gobble up your meal - which is essentially how Kati rolls are supposed to be served. To some of the other reviews- yes they have a variety of options like biryani - but the place is for KATI ROLLS. its in the title. Biryani is not a super easy dish to make in a small fast food kitchen. Takes time and care. Don't expect it to be like a restaurant and demand that level of customer service. The people there are always pleasant when I come in - but I usually know exactly what I want. I have to say their paneer rolls are waaay better than their meat rolls. One time they forgot to give me the discount and reimbursed me while I was eating  even though I had not noticed. Very nice of them. If you're going for the first time definitely get the paneer Masala - I am willing to say that it might be their BEST roll and what I always pick up. All their other paneer rolls are great. Go for it even if you're not a vegetarian (avoid it if you're lactose intolerant).  Also - if it's your first time  do yourself a f(L)avor   (Get it!?!) and get the rose lassi. You will not be disappointed.\n",
      "TLDR: perfect for the late night munchies  can't go wrong with the mk special  and skip the drinks (unless it's the mint lemonade)  I love Masala! There's nothing like a Kati roll or chicken platter after a night out  cause this place is open til 3am!! The service is very friendly and consistent. Never had a bad interaction in the 10+ times I've been there.   Tips: if you go past 11pm on a weekend  chances are it will be packed with very hungry  very drunk customers. Also they have various student discounts so just ask! The red sauce is spicy  but definitely more manageable than halal guys. They're super generous with the sauces  and I've definitely taken more than a couple of those red and white sauces to put on my other dishes.   The only downsides I can think of are 1) even though the platters are based off those halal platters from NYC  I'm not sure if they are actually halal 2) the whole menu is kinda pricey  especially since the Kati rolls are on the small side and 3) their drinks are hit or miss - the blackberry one tasted like cough syrup  but the mint lemonade one was amazing\n",
      "Awesome paneer kathi rolls  biryani and chaas...staff was friendly and service was quick. Loved our first visit and will definitely go again.\n",
      "This place is great for many things  sport games  nights out  great weather outdoor seating and much more.  You get the benefits of multiple bars and styles of hangouts under one roof. Along with some great food options. They have a massive outdoor seating area  which is great for those beautiful weather days/nights. There is nothing like sitting outside with a beer and seeing The CBP  The Linc and the Center.  The inside host tv's all over including a giant screen in the center  so you are never missing the game.   The layout of islands/tables and small hallways can make it tough to navigate through on crowded nights  and the place can get very crowded. Security is better now then it was when it first opened. The bathrooms are also huge which is nice  becuase your typical bars usually have large crowds but small bathrooms with long lines.   Their import selection of beers is EXTREMELY LACKING too.  My favorite thing about this place is....  Parking is complimentary on non-event nights and free one hour after the start of the final event of the day. You can't ask for anything more in Philly.\n",
      "When I first learned about the Xfinity Live opening  I was excited but after going a few times  I don't find myself rushing to go back anytime soon.  The idea is great but the place is overly crowded  no matter what restaurant you go to it's hard to find a seat. If one decides to stay out in the main area  which is a killer on the feet and back  you deal with a lot of rude people just pushing their way around  I guess some of the very young partiers haven't learned how to act yet.  Honestly  it seemed more like Kiddie City than anything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great bars hands down. When I first heard about this place I was skeptical but every time it go here it's an amazing time. Do some bull riding  explore some bars  sit and relax next to a fire pit  watch some entertainment and play some games. There is so much space here but don't forget your wallet because drinking is the thing here!\n",
      "Location is excellent as it's surrounded by the stadiums.   However they dropped the ball here as it doesn't offer as much as one would hope for.   The food isn't good  the place is always dirty - floors  tables  the bar ect.    Took the family here yesterday and they have a Genos Steaks and my son wanted one - it was noon and the cooks were on break.  Waited 30 mins for a steak sandwich and we were first in line.  All 4 of us were not impressed\n",
      "No argument that Xfinity Live! is a great spot to catch a game.  They have a selection of themed bars  plenty of screens for viewing  and parking.  Be warned  parking is only free an hour after home games (but always free if all teams are away).  They have solid bar food.  They are a short walk from all the stadiums and easy to get to/from via public.  Don't think you'll have the sticker shock of stadium prices.  The draft selection is more extensive while the prices are more in line with a typical bar!  Xfinity also hosts a variety of events.  They do company parties and beerfests.  I've attended as a company party guest and was happy with everything.  Overall  hit'em up!\n",
      "Great place to watch sports  fun crowd and this place is huge in the middle of everything and across the street from the subway.   Great service and wait staff.   Friendly barpersons  a dj  cheerleaders on tabletops....awesome variety of food!  Will definitely be back!....reasonable beer prices..... yet sadly overpriced liquor/mixed drinks.   Location  location  location!!\n",
      "It kinda reminds me of an ESPN Zone without all the carnival games  but it seems like just a few bars slapped together.  And what's up with the kids roaming around?  We really only came to see GreenGenes  so we didn't stray too far from the main area in the center to check out the other places.  It was pretty crowded when we got there  but that was probably because the Phillies got rained out that night.  Besides  the people watching was too good to pass up.  It's been awhile since I've seen a couple run out by the bouncers because they were basically having sex at the bar...  Anyway  beers are $5 which is a little too high in my opinion.  Bar service was decent for me  but more than one person in my group complained about it.  Other than what I've mentioned  nothing special to see other than the girls trying WAY too hard.\n",
      "Really great sports bar one of my favorites!  A bunch of really cool places to grab food including my favorite chickie's and petes.  Has a mechanical bull and skee ball! Also  has outdoor area with live music.  Giant beer pong games on fridays.\n",
      "Great neighborhood bar w good food  a Solid beer list with lots of local brews and a full bar.\n",
      "Dined here for a friend's birthday celebration. Staff were very attentive  pleasant and accommodating to our growing party. Excellent draft beer with a solid list of selections. Typical bar food menu though the food was surprisingly very flavorful and done perfectly. There is a lovely outdoor area here. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Don't expect a huge menu if you're going for lunch dinner  but the food you get is actually pretty good and different from regular \\bar food\\\". They have a good selection of drinks and the atmosphere is great. On warmer days there is an outside patio which is really nice. Friendly staff. Good service. I recommend!\"\n",
      "American sardine bar is a fun place with friendly staff and a great draft and bottled beer list. But that isn't the reason for 5 stars.  It's this. The kitchen appears to be run by an evil 5 year old genius. The sandwiches are all the stuff you'd love to put between two pieces of bread but would never have the nerve to serve yourself  let alone friends. The salt and pepper fries are perfect. The spaghetti sandwich is to die for (top tip  do not attempt to eat as a sandwich  use a knife and fork) and the spicy ham and cheese may be one if the best things you could ever put in your mouth. And the prices are very reasonable  service fun and atmosphere lively.  Great place!\n",

      "One of my first ventures into South Philly night life landed me at Sardine's - a casual  spacious bar with a small menu of decadent eats and a nice beer selection. The walls are lined with the eclectic art of a local artist  and christmas lights dangle from the ceilings.   Sardine's is a two story joint  offering two different vibes - the downstairs had the feeling of a local pub  while upstairs felt like hipster heaven. There's also a nice outdoor area that seems like a great place to enjoy a summer happy hour.   Compliments to the chef  Doreen  for her amazing food! The menu varies daily  but there's no doubt you'll easily devour whatever you select. Our table sampled some spicy harissa carrots  a hummus and pita spread  and pretzels with vegan beer cheese. We also ordered a wild mushroom grilled cheese  that I kid you not  was as big as my head. It was melty  gooey  and everything a grilled cheese sandwich should be.  Big fan! Will definitely be back when the weather gets nicer.\n",
      "ASB was worth every cent of my $11 Uber ride from Fairmount.  Motivated by their California-centric brew event  our group of ~10 [Yelpers and friends] arrived and settled into a big booth next to the bar. For the next few hours  we managed to order most of the beers on their special list (Hey pretty Almanac! Love you  Ballast Point and Alesmith!) while also getting a taste of their regular food menu.  I went with the pulled pork sandwich. Definitely not my usual meal choice  but theirs was pretty interesting in its own way. As Steph S. put it  the sandwich somehow paralleled a cheesesteak in taste. I liked it!  After eating  some of us went outside for a bit. It was a cool night  their fire pits were ablaze and the bar was decorated colorfully with classic lights. So nice.  Point Breeze isn't a neighborhood I visit all too often  but I'd be happy to return and explore more of ASB's menu and draft choices in the future!\n",
      "Been to Stateside 4 times  first 3 times drinks only   dinner with last visit.  The space is small but decor and vibe are spot on.  During summer months  the huge windows open up and you're seating from outside at the bar.  We stopped in for a drink after dinner at Le Virtu.  Had a whiskey sour and a boulevardier.  Loved them both.  Their cocktail game is solid.  The bartenders were friendly but really didnt engage us but it was busy and it was a cocktail hit and we all know how that goes  ok  maybe not all of us.   All in all service and cocktails are solid.  Last visit we decided on dinner.  I thought dinner was ok.  Nothing bad but nothing great.   I'll still stop in at Stateside for my night caps.\n",

      "Cauliflower soup and Kale salad are a must!!!! Really tasty. Bartenders were friendly and on point. The brussel sprouts were a little too salty. Mussel clam dish was good  but wouldn't get them again for $22. Decent beer selection  cool atmosphere.\n",
      "The menu is very unique and reasonably priced.  The bone marrow and sausage was awesome!  There are also some interesting specialty drinks.  We didn't try any of them  but they were also reasonably priced.  They had a ton of beer and liquor options ranging from $3 Yuenglings to $20+ shots of Whistle Pig--there is definitely something for everyone here.    The waitresses were so so so great--very nice  friendly  and attentive.  The owner happened to be there as well  and also a pretty nice guy.    Unfortunately  there was a fella working there who took himself a bit too seriously  and was just kind of rude in my opinion.  After the place pretty much cleared out for the night  a few friends met us there for some birthday cocktails.  When a friend pulled a chair up to our table  he immediately came over and told her that she couldn't put a chair there because it would be blocking the \\aisle\\\" (which it wasn't by the way).  I totally understand that there are regulations and rules that he needs to adhere to  but he was just rude about it.  I believe he told us to \\\"respect the aisle way\\\".  Power trip?  He could have been way more polite about it.  He is the only reason that I will not give this place 5 stars.  He should take a tip from his waitstaff on how to interact with people and make them feel welcome.    The ambiance is also cool--low lights  great music  and plain decor that just feels right.\"\n",
      "Wow  what a place! Went there Saturday for the bourbon (yes  had the Winkle- just one though  -) and was surprised how great the food was. My wide and I sat outside  the service was great  very attentive. The small plates are outstanding. I had foi gras  octopus and oysters on the half. The wife had baby kale and grilled zucc. After din din we went into the bar. Great bar! Windows open  looking out to square  bar stools outside too. Pro bar tenders there- mixologistsss makin great drinks-  I forgot the first cocktail- with bourbon- it was very tasty  unique flavor- just ask for recommendation on a good bourbon cocktail  that's what I did. Then had a bourbon whisky sour with egg white- best I ever had!  We were at bar for a while  so got another octo plate- it melts in your mouth- better than lobster to me! Background music was low and rockish. If I lived in Phila  I'd be there once a week!\n",
      "LOVE the drinks here. & I hardly like mixed drinks. Super cozy atmosphere for drinks with friends. Cool bar  cool drinks  love it.   Food  on the other hand  was alright. A little unimpressed/super salty at times.\n",
      "Amazing food amazing atmosphere and amazing people!  I would definitely recommend the jerk salmon with Brussels sprouts and thyme infused pineapple.   Plus the charcuterie is a pleasing platter to the tastebuds!\n",
      "...Although I would catagorize Stateside as \\spendy\\\" your options are wonderful.  Menu has changed but the whisky is still the same kind of wonderful!! DO have the Steak Tartare  Pate  and note the Salads are GREAT!  Just call me Bubbles dahling...\"\n",
      "Excellent dinner and such a cozy atmosphere!! I have only been once and it was a great experience so I will be back. I had the Restaurant Week menu and enjoyed every course! There was even a cocktail pairing that was perfect with each course.   The pre-fixed menu for the special restaurant week had a lot of selections. I started with a mushroom lettuce wrap which was delicious! My favorite course I had was the Cod Fillet entree. It was cooked to perfection and so flavorful.   The service was a little slower than I would have liked but other than that I have no complaints! Check this place out. The bar area looks so cool so I think I'll be back to check out their happy hour one day soon.\n",
      "The wife and I recently brunched here.. thats my new verb: brunched.  Little Spoon is nice inside  i didn't get to dine in the yard but it looked nice  especially on a beautiful day.   The servers were great  attentive and seemed to be having fun- which creates a pleasant experience for everyone. Onto the food.  3 to 3.5 yelps.  The pancakes were kind of flat  I'm into some nice thick pancakes  but weren't bad.  We also got the brisket sandwich  it was very good  well half of it  the other half was literally all fat.  I get that a nice fatty brisket brings great taste  but i woulda liked some meat on the sandwich  i literally ate half a sandwich of fat-- yet id order it again bc like i said- it had some good taste.  Just my bad luck i guess from the carver.  I would give this place another go  i dug the ambiance and they seem to have a few brunch items id like to try.  A-OK\n",
      "The food was insanely good. Everything we got was full of flavor  fresh and came out hot.  You can really tell they care about the quality of food they put out down to every detail. The decor and vibe of the restaurant of very hip and eclectic. Next time I'm in Philly  I'm definitely going back there.\n",
      "This time I came on a Thursday at 2pm. There were six people already dining  but there was no line. They took my order immediately. I ordered the infamous Monte Cristo  substituted potatoes for the side salad it comes with  and got a side of sausage (I had a long  hectic morning and didn't eat breakfast).   Everything was tasty  but not particularly life-changing as Zagat prepared me for because the Monte Cristo was on their \\10 best sandwiches\\\" list. I suppose it's the best breakfast sandwich I've had in the city thus far  but I don't think it ranks in the top 10 best sandwiches I've had in the city. The cider-braised pork sandwich (I had my first visit) was incredible.   This is not at the fault of the staff  but three women came in with three small children (ages 3-5). The one kid screamed at the top of his lungs (for real) because the mom gave money to the other kid and not him. The mom didn't tell him to be quiet or anything  and the other mom yelled (angrily) at the other kid for touching her foot or something. The other two kids proceeded to yell at each other and fight. No one said anything  not even the staff asked them to quiet down their kids. Like I'm sorry you can't discipline your kids  but don't bring them to a restaurant to disturb paying customers and then not do anything about it.   There's still nowhere to put dirty dishes  and they don't come around to take them from you very often  as there was at least one other person's finished food (the plate wasn't empty) sitting around.   So far the only thing that has been worthwhile is the cider-braised pork sandwich  and I don't think I should continue coming back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tiny little cafe  but it's definitely worth it at non-peak brunch times! Try the Vietnamese iced coffee  the Monte Cristo  and the French toast.\n",
      "Definitely a neighborhood gem! Besides the adorable Tiffany-blue (:P) exterior it has quite the quaint interior decor as well. But most importantly  the food is excellent here.  The menu has a good selection both from the Savory and the Sweet sections. It's not an overly creative menu but the execution has always been solid. I'm a fan of the shakshuka and the Monte Cristo sandwich and if you have a few people to split dishes with  I highly recommend getting an order of the lemon ricotta pancakes to share among yourselves. Believe me it'll bring you closer together. The coffee/juice option is also great here  extra bonus is that they serve Vietnamese Iced Coffee. Sometimes you just need that extra dose of caffeine. It does look like the menu has evolved (I remember there used to be a duck salad I enjoyed) but a few signature dishes remained.   There's decent seating space and the place flies under the radar just enough (although I don't know why because IMO it's better than many other places where there are brunch lines every weekend) that the most I've ever had to wait for a table was around 15 minutes. The service is no frills but attentive. I would recommend this to any friend.\n",
      "Such an incredible quint place. It stands at the corner of the street. Their Christmas decorations were minimum but really cute. They have both savory and sweet options for brunch.  I had the brussel sprouts and gouda cheese frittata from the savory section and the apple butter filled French toast with walnuts.   Although   the frittata had the consistency of an omelette it was really good. The brussel sprouts were crunchy in the middle and the cheese was melted throughout. Highly recommended   although it was a special for that day. Hope they put it on their regular menu.  The apple butter stuffed French toast.  Where do I begin? Not sure what I loved the best  the French toast  the Apple butter   the Apple caramel or the crunchy walnuts? It worked so well  I practically cleaned out my plate and even finished my friend's share. It was different but it worked well.   PS:  one of the neatest restrooms I have ever used in a restaurant.\n",
      "Such a cute little breakfast brunch spot in Philly! Went here with my family when visiting my sister at school. We waited a bit maybe about 20-30 minutes on a Sunday morning. We all enjoyed our food! The only thing that was not very good was the fried duck.. very greasy and overcooked. Other than that  it was a great experience and I would definitely return if in the neighborhood again!\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is so welcoming and cozy. I need to write a review about the Monte Cristo sandwich though  in particular. It is hands-down one of the best brunch sandwiches I've ever had. Like it's Monday and I'm still thinking about it 24 hours later. It comes with a side salad of arugula that has delicious dressing and it somehow compliments the sandwich perfectly!   Our server was very kind and attentive. I also love how I got a massive cup of coffee in a Charlie Brown mug. I really think this is one of the best places you can eat brunch in Philly.\n",
      "The reason for my not so great review is because of their lack of selection for toppings. They don't have any of the good stuff! Some of my favorite things to get when I go to froyo shops are brownie bits  cheesecake pieces  Heath  and popping boba (I think that's what they're called?). This place didn't have any of those things on the 2 occasions I went. They had a few different kinds of fruit  Reese's cups  some wafer cookie things  and a few other things in dispensers. Meh. For the most part I like this place and I'd go back if my friends were going  but I wouldn't be the one to suggest it.   The decor and theme is really nice though. They even have creative names for their froyo flavors.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is magical. Try the butter beer! Pro tip: drink it there - you will feel like your mouth is in Hogsmeade. The frozen yogurts are all delicious and the decor is great for movie buffs. The crème brûlée is very good - from a connoisseur of such treats. I also can never leave without a peanut butter peanut cup cookie. Oh  and the macaroons and ... Everything.\n",
      "I love this place!! I come here once a week- peanut butter is the best flavor- it's so creamy I can't believe it's not ice cream. Also love Nutella  gingerbread and pumpkin! Friendly service- great neighborhood spot.\n",
      "I really enjoy this place. Really. I do. Good froyo and treats  solid coffee  great location  and all the nerdy stuff you can possibly oogle at while indulging a sweet tooth.  But don't serve savory items unless you know how to execute them. I.e. eggs benedict should have poached eggs and ham that isn't cheapo lunchmeat. The waffle base was quite tasty. Everything else was poor in quality  including my friend's panini that she said tasted frozen.   I hatehatehate picking on service  but the guy there was really.... just  rude. sorry for ordering food off of the menu and not just coming in for coffee and dessert?\n",
      "Had crime brûlée here.   Great service and overall experience.   Very clean. Serve are nice.  Will gladly return to try everything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is so adorable! Everything is super kawaii and the macrons are lovely! I also ordered the butterbeer  and speaking as someone who has gotten the real thing from universal studios  this is just as tasty! Well done!\n",
      "Came here after getting dinner at Sonny's and I really loved it! I'm from the west coast and go to LA often where liquid nitrogen ice cream is pretty popular so I already knew what it was and was pretty shocked to see it out here! So awesome on this store's end for being ahead of the game!   My first impression when I came in was \\wow\\\" this place has everything! From boba to liquid nitrogen ice cream to ramen  etc. How perfect!   I came in for the liquid nitrogen ice cream so that is what I got! I chose Thai tea and for a double scoop it was $7.99. A little pricey  but you pay for the hype right? Was very impressed at their wide range of flavors to choose from. Couple interesting ones to note: Wasabi?! Wish I got to try that.   My Thai tea ice cream was great and toppings were free (even better!) so I packed on some mochi and strawberries. My only reason for the 4 stars is the lady that was taking my order was a little rude and snappy. She didn't exactly seem like she wanted to be there.   Other than that  great place!\"\n",
      "This place is a great little gem in Old City. Instead of garish bright colors that froyo joints seem to go with these days  every little detail is a clever nod to a beloved movie or pop culture reference. I feel like I see something new every time I walk in! Not to mention  the froyo is tasty and the toppings are not lacking.   Highly recommend.\n",
      "Love the draft list  though I wish they had everything on their list all the time. They have the switch system where if one particular beer runs out  there's a replacement draft for that beer. Even so  there's a great selection.  There's plenty of seating  but it fills up quickly. We stood around for a bit before we got a place to sit. The bartenders are quick and would check on you periodically  despite being very busy.   Overall  great atmosphere  great beer.\n",
      "Wait time was way too long for French toast  an omelette  and Mac n cheese mixed with short ribs (5\\ ramekin).   The food was tasty but you can make it at home.   The decor is great.   Bathrooms are clean.   Music is groovy.   3 pluses and 2 minuses equals 3 stars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I found myself grabbing dinner here on a Sunday evening.  Upon walking in you can't help but note the wood work  and chic metal work that are the hanging lights.  Great feel upon first stepping in the door.   The restaurant was fairly empty (understandable for 9pm on a Sunday) and we were sat in the back by the bathrooms.  All I have to say  the scented candles in the bathrooms  great touch.  I might have pee'd  by candle light just because I could!     I elected to go with the Roast beef sandwich  while the ladies I was with elected to each dabble with their burgers.  My sandwich  although delicious most definately sat in the window for a few minutes.   The bottom of the roll was a soggy mess  and the beef was barely warm.  I elected to not say anything to our server simply because I almost never send food back  and I was starving.  Don't get me wrong  the sandwich was delicious & I cleared my plate  but I was slightly disappointed.    Our server could have been more on point  it took over 15 minutes for him to refill our beverages  & we were never asked how the food was and if we needed/wanted anything else.\n",
      "I like this place - warm cozy atmosphere with homey filling food and an extensive and interesting beer list.  However  service and speed need to be improved.  That said  I would try this place again though.  The short rib mac-n-cheese was very good (needed some salt though - there was none in it).  The pierogies were yummy  but portion size was a bit small (3 per order).  The fries in the poutine were a bit soggy though.  Stuffed peppers were mushy and unmemorable.  Entree did not arrive until at least 30minutes after appetizers though (on a slow weeknight) and no updates on progress and the wait staff was not very apologetic.  This is perhaps because I came with a large group and staff was guaranteed a hefty tip the minute we sat down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great food and good  reasonably priced beer selection.  Both dishes we ordered were delicious.  It's a very popular place  so don't expect a quiet dinner for hushed conversation - but the atmosphere is fun and casual  and the service is solid.\n",
      "Updating my review from 2012  I was dissappointed there were slim to none veggie options.  Now they have a wonderful huge veggie salad with:  Roasted Celery Root  Fennel Butternut Squash  Lentil Vinaigrette  Baby Arugula.   Its dammmmn good so now I'm a happy camper :-)   That earns Cambridge 4.5 stars now!  (not 5 because its always packed and loud).  Still love this place!  I'm here often.  Everything else about my prior review is still true!  Oh  and the nachos are really yummy too!\n",
      "I love it here. Cambridge is a great place for really good food and beer. I don't usually eat roast beef but after ordering it on a whim with a hangover  it's been hard for me to order anything else. They always have good specials and the pierogies are Delish. The bar has nice dim lighting with a cozy feel. Staff is super friendly.   My only complaints are food can sometimes take awhile to come out but totally worth the wait. Also the noise level is ridiculous. The only time I didn't have a problem hearing people at my table was brunch. So don't bring grandma here for dinner!\n",
      "Great place!  Delicious flatbreads and fun atmosphere.  Very crowded when we went (~7:30pm on a Thursday night)  but we were seated within 15 minutes.  May be tricky with larger groups  but a fun place to go on a date or with a friend.\n",
      "I love you Tria Taproom. Your service is excellent and your flatbreads are delicious. Will you marry me?   Came here with Elaine M. for happy hour and was so happy with the experience.  Went sharesies with my gal pal with two veggie flatbreads.  The Kennett Square and the Burrata.  Magnificent.   The Kennett Square had fontina  wild mushrooms  zucchini  red onion  truffle puree   and the Burrata had mozzarella  provolone  garlic spinach  balsamic onion  and lemon zest.  It was hard to pick a favorite so I am glad we ordered both. If you are a vegetarian  meat lover  or a Friday-during-Lent-Catholic- you will be happy you ordered these.\n",
      "Came here to catch up with a friend and from the moment I entered to the moment I left  I was so surprised and impressed at how polite all the staff was! It's a pretty small space and can easily be crowded because of that fact  so be mindful of that. A lot of the other reviews state that they really like the iPads. Unfortunately  I wasn't one of those people. I think there's just this feeling about holding a menu instead of a digital device  but it is cool that they tell you the amount of beer that's left in the keg.  I would say the best bang for your buck to get is the flatbread. My friend who was \\so hungry\\\" couldn't manage to eat the whole thing  so I gladly helped myself to the Parma. The calamari is a guaranteed plate cleaner of a dish! It is a bit expensive  so if you're trying to impress a date you should take them there. Just know that you may not be able to hear them because not only is it a bit loud  but it is also a place great for people watching.\"\n",
      "Great beer selection  and I especially liked the iPad menu (technically it's not an iPad  but you get the idea)  which indicates  among other things  when a particular item is about to kick ... last call! Great place for an after-work beer or to stop in for a beer before heading out to meet friends for dinner. Excellent service. The last few visits  I haven't tried any food items  but I'm sure the food meets the usual high standards of the other Tria locations.\n",
      "I came to the Tria Taproom on two different occasions and it's a great alternative menu to the original Tria locations.   The restaurant space is sleek and modern even down to the menus (the drink menus are on iPad minis). Instead of a selection of meat and cheeses the food menu has a hearty selection of filling small plats and flatbreads. I got the tavern ham for lunch and it was AMAZING. I am still thinking about it  four days later.\n",
      "Love the beer  the atmosphere  the service  the I-pad beverage list  and most of the food. Came here for PBW featuring  5 $5 Pizza Boy beers + 1/2 price flatbreads.  The Burrata flatbread let me down. Very bland  and the crust was just so -so. It did not look at all like the photos  nor taste as described. Very little spinach - garlic(couldn't taste ANY garlic)  the balsamic onions were basically non - existent  as was the lemon zest. Maybe I ordered the wrong kind  as the folks next to me were raving about their ham  duck  & breakfast ones. I prefer the flatbreads @ Earth Bread & Brewery. Glad they were1/2 price at least!\n",
      "The food here was phenomenal. We live about an hour away and decided to head into Philly for a Sunday meal.  On the way my girlfriend found this place and it just sounded amazing. We found the place easily and there is a parking lot right across the intersection. We walked in and the place had absolutely no wait which was awesome seeing as I thought it would have been very busy on a Sunday afternoon.  We ordered the cheese curds which may have been some of the best I've ever had. Also ordered the Kenner square flatbread which too was amazing. It had an nice spicy flavor at the end of each bite. Lastly we got the Cuban. That was another out of this world sandwich. We also decided to go with the dessert which was a strawberry shortcake. This was a perfect finish to a great meal.   They had a great selection of beers as well. We tried most of them during our meal. Place is very neat and clean. Service was great. Personally I really enjoy small plates so you don't overeat and these sizes were perfect. I will definitely be back for another visit. This time I hope to get back and get a crowler of beer seeing as this time I was not able to make it back before we had to leave.\n",
      "This review is for the lunch service at Tria. My girlfriend and I were warmly greeted just past opening time for lunch. As we were seated I noticed a modern but rustic feel to the place. Service gets an A+. Nick made sure our glasses were never below half full and was well spoken  polite  and knew the entire menu. I got the pork rib sandwich and my date got the grilled chicken sandwich. Both were cooked to perfection and thoughtful plated and full of flavor. Thanks Nick.\n",
      "First of all  there is wine on tap. What is better than that? They provide iPads so you can check out what's on tap (wine or beer)  how much is left  what it's like  etc. Very cool. The food was awesome  especially the \\fries\\\" and the flatbread. They were super accommodating to a large group of us  which was very appreciated. This is my new favorite place in the city!\"\n",
      "As a beer guy this is my favorite of the Trias. Their selection boasts unique domestic craft beers alongside some harder to get European beers. There iPad system of choosing your beer is a cute novelty. I have been there twice and both times the service was great. They aren't overly on top of you so you can enjoy your be and conversation  yet if you need anything they notice and come immediately.In terms of food  Im not sure I get the hoopla. My girlfriend and her friends love the artichoke dip but I think its a bit too heavy. I have also had the fish tacos- good not great (watch out the hot sauce they provide is super hot) and the spinach salad - nothing memorable but perfectly decent salad (friend liked the goat cheese but felt he has had better). I think its really the decor  service and great selection that makes this place great. The food is just an added bonus - if your hungry get something to eat its above average but not great.\n",
      "Vango has pretty much become my primary spot in Philly once Walnut Room closed (R.I.P.) - and I'm talking before the re-branded Ten Six travesty.  Since then  they've started charging a cover (because they knew they would get the fall out from Walnut Room (i.e. people looking for hip-hop  reggae  trap  Top 40  etc. in Center City West).  But I always have a great time here.  They always have great DJs spinning and when the place is packed  it's always a good time.  It's a great venue for Sips but also great on Friday and (especially) Saturday night.  I had to bump the score down because the bartenders automatically add a %20 gratuity to your drink purchase.  That's really lame.  So if one of the bartenders I don't know is making my drink  I just tip ONE DOLLAR in cash.  That's a very shady practice... no bueno.  Otherwise  great spot.\n",
      "I wish more than anything on this planet I could give this business a negative three million stars. My boyfriend and I were invited to a friends party on the rooftop for a QUOTE VIP UNQUOTE section. We get there and they ask us to pay a $10 cover charge. This didn't make much sense because our friends party which we explain & luckily are not forced to pay. We get upstairs and to get on the rooftop you MUST have a paid drink in your hand. So my boyfriend and I spend $26 just to get to our friends party. It doesn't matter if you don't want to drink you just HAVE to. We get up there and there's literally no space. Our VIP section is right next to the the kitchen no entry room waitress walking area and we have a large group so we were reprimanded many times for standing in their way even though we had no space to begin with so whatever we do what they say. We decided to order a hookah & food and got a table.  We opened a tab and later in the night some other people from the party joined our table. A girl sitting with us was caught sneaking alcohol in her purse. They searched her purse and confiscated the alcohol & scolded all of us for one persons choice. The manager moments later came back and told us he usually kicks people out for that but since \\we\\\" were apart of the party we were allowed to stay. I don't understand why he forced her mistake on us but we all just nodded and continued on. I swear to god three seconds after he walks away the not even mentionable in this story waitresses approached us and told us that the two people with open tabs were being FORCED to spend $100 no matter what to stay. I don't know what this bar thinks it is but it's one of the biggest waste of money  time  & should not be given your hard earned money. Also  there's no speakers on the roof. I could go on forever  but please avoid this place like the plague it is.\"\n",

      "I've been coming to Vango for Monday night salsa lessons off and on for 2 and a half years  and while there are definitely some things I don't love about vango  the open dance floor always brings me back.  Things I like: -There's no cover & Monday night salsa lessons/the open dance floor are free -They have a great rooftop bar (which I've only ever gotten up to twice) -There's a mix of pros and newbies so all levels are welcome (especially for women)  Things I don't like:  -No free tap water so you have to buy a 4 dollar 12oz bottle of VOSS \\artesian\\\" water.  -Some of the guys there (including the instructor) are creepy and will try to rub up against you\"\n",
      "Went on a Tuesday at 11:00pm with a $25 voucher. Place was pretty dead. Setting is okay  service okay. Food Price was okay.  Everything was just - okay. Not horrible but not amazing. They played hip hop music and offered us poll dancing which I readily declined. I did not get a drink since I was driving  my mom did and it was a special drink for $4. I got tuna tempera roll and spring rolls. They were pretty good  I would not come here just for the food (I know better sushi places) but if you to go on a week day when its slow for some food with a dance floor it seems okay. They do add a 20% tip  I knew this ahead and told my mom because she would not have noticed. There is NO WHERE does it say tip is added to bill  normally you will find that in the menu small at the bottom  so I can see where people get  pissed. Specially since its not standard practice on small parties and your server does not mention it. I think they do it on purpose to get drunk people to tip them double  low low low.....\n",
      "Still a solid 2 stars.. they're not quite bad enough to be a 1 star  but DEFINITELY not a 3 star either.  It's so unfortunate because it's such a lovely location. But they have some serious work to do.. they have a lot of potential but they need to do something about it.   Ambiance: 2 stars -- when you walk in when it's not crowded.. there's a weird smell to it. It doesnt smell BAD per-se  but it just smells old.. like a lotta philly spots. +1 star for sitting outside during beautiful weather. It's not high enough to see the beautiful philly skyline  but it's not bad.  Service: 1.5 stars. I wish I got her name  but it was a shorter brunette caucasian server that worked that night. She took almost 12-15 minutes to get our order. Yes we had a groupon -- but that doesn't mean that I wouldn't have tipped her well. Anyway -- she took forever to come to us to take our order. She kept saying \\ I'll be right back\\\" and would service the couple next to us  and the guys with cigars next to us. thanks... But yeah  if you couldn't tell.. her service was terrible.   Food/Drinks For groupon price -- COMPLETELY worth it. Without groupon -- NO.  The sushi is honestly very good! It's fresh  presentation was great  and it tasted great. But for the price of $14 + per roll -- not worth it. Because the quality was no better than vics/fat salmon or anything.  Drinks were very good -- I was totally a fan of those. I left pretty tipsy off of 3 drinks. OH yes i just remembered. YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR A DRINK TO GET UPSTAIRS. So that made sitting upstairs + groupon not as worth it.. but it's okay :)  Overall -- awesome for groupon deal. terrible service. good food  good drinks. just not worth the pricetag\"\n",
      "Came here for a friend's bday. When I got here (I wanna say 11-ish)  I was considering leaving cause it was kinda lame.  Not many people.  And it was a Friday night...I was surprised.  Turns out it's the best thing I could have done.  Word of advice: if you wanna get to the best spot in the bar (i.e. the rooftop lounge)  do what I did and get here earlier than the crowd.  There wasn't a line and we got right up.  We did already have drinks so I'm sure if we didn't  they would have made us buy them before going up because that seems to be the general consensus in all the reviews.  Also  my drink (whiskey sour) was made perfectly  not like that's hard to fuck up but I've been places where they just got it all wrong.  The bartenders here seemed to know what they were doing.  The music was better upstairs and the bar wasn't as packed as the one downstairs.  The DJ and bar is inside and if it's too cold or hot outside  it's nice that they have this little area to escape to.  It was a chilly night  but the heat lamps outside really do help.  Plus  they have a bathroom up there so you don't have to go back downstairs.  That was nice.  Overall  I'd come here again only if it was a friend's birthday because: A) I could get cheaper drinks elsewhere (our tab was pretty high by the night's end) and B) the crowd of leering/grabbing men was a bit annoying.  The rooftop is a really nice touch and you can't get that anywhere else in the city (that I know of)  so if you wanna chill out on some couches/mattresses and view the Philly skyline at night  go here.\n",
      "Went here with a living social deal..  We got there early on a Friday night around 7:30 PM.  It was a different scene to be able to hang out on the sofa cushions they have set up in the back but the view of the Philly skyline is awesome.  Also the sushi is surprisingly awesome and even more awesomely priced.  Some of the cocktails are little off... I specifically ordered a chocolate martini sounding drink and it was god awful.  But frankly for the food prices and the vibe  I'd go there again.\n",
      "I also bought the Travelzoo special and wish I would've read the reviews first.  The food was ok  but they served the drinks in plastic which doesn't seem quite right when drinking a $14 glass of champagne. They added 20% on for gratuity even though there were only two of us in our party.  They told me I needed to use the online system to make a reservation.  I used PayPal  which was recommended and when I arrived they had no record of my deposit.  I checked my credit card today and they charged $21 over the signed amount on my receipt!  I will not return and recommend NOT going here.\n",
      "The roof top is actually really cool and the happy hour prices are good. The food was decent I had the sweet shrimp tempura and calamari which was meh. My fiancé had the burger and sushi which he actually really enjoyed. Fries are great also!   Be mindful though the two of us were charged 20% gratuity. Service was great and I would have actually tipped more but I don't agree with charging a gratuity (if its not a large group) and especially not when you're not notified--thankfully he caught it on the receipt.\n",
      "Came here last Friday evening with a group of 5 ladies. We arrived right before closing and still had an enjoyable experience. I was nervous initially because I felt like they may have been annoyed we showed up right before they closed. Nonetheless the service and food was very good. I ordered a chicken vermicelli bowl  which was very reasonably priced and not very heavy as it was so late in the evening. I enjoyed the décor and would definitely try this place again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The decor of the place does not look like your typical Vietnamese place. It is much nicer and cleaner and hip.   The place was packed. I think this is due to a lot of places in the area closed until sundown for Ramadan.   The portions are fair sized and everything tasted like your standard Vietnamese joint. No surprises. I ordered a papaya salad to be healthy. Much regret as they are not my jam.   Service was also about average for your typical Vietnamese place.   3.5 stars but I'll round up to 4\n",
      "Vietnam is THE best ever.  My family and I have been going here since forever  beginning with their original restaurant in Chinatown.  They are like family to us  Benny always comes and greets us and all of the waiters know us by name.  The service is impeccable and fast.  My favorite go to dishes are the Cha Gio  which are crispy spring rolls served with mint and iceberg lettuce...so good.  My others are the pork chops and the lime chicken  which comes with a non-heavy but savory sauce and bok choy.  THE absolute best thing on their menu is the Shaken Beef!!!  It is tender beef medallions with red onion  cilantro and some type of greens (not sure what but it is good).  It is the most delicious thing ever.  Their pho is also excellent  I recommend the beef lemongrass.  It fills you up but doesn't drag you down.  I love this place and will continue to go there until the day I die!  Everyone must visit at least once!\n",
      "Love this place! The food is amazing and everyone is very nice. I love that if we ask for spicy they will actually make it spicy unlike some of these places. I recommend the pho and pad Thai.\n",
      "This restaurant is excellent. The food is of good quality  great flavors all around and they even have a wonderful staff. Will be stoping by here again for sure.\n",
      "Wanted to like this place more than I did  but the bang for buck was disappointing  eg in terms of portions and quality.  I would check it out for lunch tho.  Bad adult compo pop playing loudly.  We got a catfish dish that was chunks deep-fried to the point of chewy dryness.  Maybe we mis-ordered?  Some things were okay good  like the sticky rice.  Maybe the 4 star review is justified for those in the know?\n",
      "What a hidden gem! Great ambiance  good service  lovely decoration. Food was reasonably priced and tasty.\n",
      "Was looking forward to trying this place. However  when I informed the waiter that I had a shellfish allergy  he told me it'd be best to eat elsewhere as just about everything is cross-contaminated - even dishes marked vegan vegetarian.I thought this was not only rude of him to tell us to leave  but very irresponsible of the restaurant not to take better food safety precautions.\n",
      "Sitting here on the couch with a full belly  had to post a fast bump for a job well done.  This is the kind of place you'd take visiting family to eat in. They also do super fast take out. We have a squirmy wormy little baby and she loves their food  the ravioli makes nice finger food.  Top rated above most everything else out this way.\n",
      "The cookies were sooooooooo warm and gooey  just the way I like them. We got one upon arrival in Philly and then made sure to get a few to go upon departure!\n",
      "Stopped by for cookies when I was in Reading Terminal  my friend / tour guide said this is a \\must have\\\" in Philly.  There was no line per say  but the counter was crowded with people calling out their orders.  I wanted the black and white cookie  but they were not \\\"set\\\" so I went with white chocolate chip macadamia nut and snickerdodles.  The cookies were good  the chocolate chip macadamia nuts might have been a little too cooked for my tastes.  They had a brown hard crust around the edges  but perhaps that's just how they bake them.  Regardless  the cookies taste divine! I managed to refrain from eating a few of them long enough to get them home to my little sister  and she had no trouble putting them away either.  If you're in Reading Terminal  grab one!\"\n",
      "This has become a must-stop to grab a snack while I wander around Reading Terminal. They bake the cookies fresh constantly during the day (but if you come near close  they start running out  so better to go earlier on)  and the chocolate chip cookies are delicious. They're a bit on the heavier side for sure  but it doesn't get better than a hot  gooey mess of chocolate and cookie than this. I scarf these down quickly and always make a mess of myself  but I can't help it - these are so good! Their sugar and snickerdoodle cookies are also good  but my allegiance belongs to chocolate chip cookies  and they do these excellently here. Each cookie will set you back about $2 (although they weigh it to be exact)  but it's more than worth it.\n",
      "After DiNics  my buddy decided to get some cookies.  These things are HUGE.  They were just under $4.00 for 2 of them.  We got the original chocolate chip.  They were great!  The chocolate chips were still warm and gooey  the cookie had a slight crunch to it when you bit in and then a soft center.  Next time I go I am going to get a scoop of ice cream at Bassets and then make my own cookie sandwich......talk about heaven!\n",
      "The white chocolate macadamia nut read AMAZING! I admit  I love this flavor but theirs were awesome!\n",
      "\\Cookies! Get your cookies \\\" the lady behind the counter repeatedly announced to the crowd of people walking by. And craving something sweet after lunch  who was I to argue?  Located right inside the corner entrance of the Reading Terminal Market on 12th St  The Famous 4th Street Cookie Company is hard to miss  either by sight  sound or smell. All the cookies  including the freshly chocolate dipped ones  are clearly on display to tempt every person who dares to get close.  Fortunately  they taste as great as they look  as I thoroughly enjoyed a chocolate chip macadamia nut cookie while walking back to my car. Yum!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "These cookies are delicious  but pretty expensive.  I loved the chocolate chip pecan ones.  They're sold by the pound  but you can still buy just one at a time.\n",
      "DELICIOUS!!! Visited reading terminal for lunch and ended with 4th street cookies that did not disappoint. We had a chocolate chip cookie  a snickerdoodle  and an oatmeal raisin cookie. I WISH I HAD GOTTEN MORE! Every cookie was gooey  fresh  and soft!   If you are around the area and have a chance to try these cookies get each kind they have!\n",

      "A brilliant and dynamic cafe that's so unique and refreshing to the area. I didn't know I was eating plebeian rugelach my whole life until I tried their version here. It was rich  dense  and had the perfect ratio of chocolate to pastry.  I also had the chance to try the avocado toast  potato boreka  grilled cheese (shown in the photo)  and a smoked salmon bagel. All of which were phenomenal.   Also  to my surprise  their black coffee was super fresh. It was robust  but not in a French roast kind of way. It was a medium-light roast with some bright notes thrown in there. Hopefully it's not just a first week opening kind of thing  but I hope they continue to serve the freshest of beans.   Pro-tip: Get there early. Like from within the first hour or two from opening. The pastries are fresher  and they tend to run out of choices pretty quickly. That could change though because they might just be figuring out the quirks still.\n",
      "The food is amazing. Be prepared to wait in a long line and make sure to come in early to get what you want before they are running out.  The cafe is narrow but deep so the line can build up to the back. There are not many seating area. There are outdoor seating and some by the bar.  Service was great. Staff is friendly  service is pretty fast. You can see the kitchen.  Borekas: they are like puff pastry. Potato : it has curry flavor lots of filling flavor is on point . Jam and sweet cheese: delicious but not much filling compared to the potato version. Both has perfect pastry and flavor.  Rugelach: one order consists of 3 rugelachs. Generous with chocolate fillings and moist. It's awesome. Definitely get it.   Mini babka has orange flavor in it. It's moist and delicious.  Tahini chocolate chip is awesome too  it's soft kind cookie. It's fragile so it didn't survive after I finish running my errands.   Walnut cake is very moist and sweet  the sweetest among all that I tried.   Avocado kubaneh toast is amazing. It has spread of Schug sauce that gives a spicy kick topped with sliced of thick fresh avocado and finished with sliced fresh and juicy tomato. It's not a regular avocado toast.  Tahini and molasses kubaneh toast is amazing too. It tastes like PB and J. You cannot find it anywhere else.  Egg and cheese on Jerusalem bagel is great. The bagel is long and soft  perfectly toasted. It has schug spread that gives spicy kick. The egg is thick. Flavor is on point.  Overall the food is amazing. Perfect flavor and very special. I took a star down because I couldn't get the Pistachio sticky buns because they were sold out by 11. I will definitely come back\n",
      "Not quite ready for prime time. They are consistently sold out of babka  rugelach and other pastries before 11:00am. And there is a substantial bottleneck because only one staff takes orders for the entire restaurant. Food is good so hopefully these kinks will be worked out in the coming weeks.\n",
      "I went to K'Far for dinner last night and my rating is bumped to 5 stars...if not more. I made a reservation for 6 pm and I was seated on time. I was waiting for my friend  and while I waited I got a drink and chatted with the server about her food recommendations. She was attentive  and very helpful in assisting me to decide what we should order. When my friend arrived  we ordered almost right away (she was very trusting of our server's recommendations).  We got the whipped feta  cauliflower  and basturma and melon. Everything was next level great. We shared the T'bit for two for our entree. I was so excited by this dish. The flavors and textures were perfectly right.  We were debating which dessert to get  and as a very thoughtful and not necessary gesture  our server sent us over a complementary one. None of the desserts disappointed - I recommend the malabi and rugelach french toast so you can dip one into the other!  Will definitely be returning to K'Far!!!\n",
      "Walked in at about 9:30am. There was a small line forming but it went by quickly. The woman behind the counter was nice and asked if I had any questions about the menu. I ordered a pistachio sticky bun and beet toast and sat down at a table. Water and utensils are located in the middle of the restaurant and are self-serve. The reviews for the pistachio sticky bun overhyped it for me but it was still good. The bun hard on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  The waitress brought over my beet toast and it was totally Instagram worthy. The beet mixture had layers of flavor and is served on warm thick toast. Overall the experience was pleasant  service was friendly and the food was good.\n",
      "When I heard that K'Far Cafe would be opening  I couldn't wait to check it out! I got there on a Saturday  at 7:45am  15 minutes before opening  and was the third person in line. I wanted to get there early  since I heard that some pastries have been selling out before 9am. By opening time  the line outside went to the end of the block. When the doors opened  I was super psyched and already had a list of everything that I wanted to order. We (group of 4) got 3 Chocolate Rugelach  2 pistachio sticky buns  3 mini chocolate babkas  1 potato boreka  1 Bulgarian feta boreka  1 Jerusalem bagel (smoked salmon)  1 salt roasted beets toast and the Yemenite Latte. I also wanted to try the Quinoa Tabbouleh  but they didn't offer that until 11am. Everything of course was delicious  but my absolute favorites were the borekas!! They were amazingggg! Next time I go  I would get a pistachio bun  a bunch of the borekas  a toast that others were getting with fig that looked delicious  and would want to try the salads & grains. I loved the beautiful ambiance! There was an open kitchen  where you could the chefs whipping up the magical dishes and everything was just so pretty! The staff was super friendly and professional. All of the tables were filled by around 8:20am (but there was additional seating in another room at the back of the restaurant). There was also still a line when we left around 8:45am. Can't wait to go back!!\n",
      "This place is awesome! Thank you Mike! We had a great time  enjoyed the food and really appreciated the hospitality you showed us! -The Pakistani family from today\n",
      "I live for the konafeh here and die for the cocktails  wine selection and dessert drinks. This is less inundated by people than zahav  smaller venue but equally good food and ambience without the  hype. Sometimes one just wants to walk into a place  be seated at the bar without waiting for 2 hours and that is the magic of kfar!  The breakfast/brunch/pastry offerings in the morning are perhaps even better then the dinner.\n",
      "pretty good food. the house made chips and salsa are excellent.  Im definitely going to consider this spot for my next large group byob type outing.\n",
      "My friends and I have eaten here before and really enjoyed the food.  We've been talking about going to the all-you-can-eat Taco Tuesday for a while  so today we finally had the time.  The advertisements for Taco Tuesday say nothing about the time it begins so we assumed it was an all day event.  Wrong.  It starts at 5pm.  Luckily  our waitress was able to convince the owner to let us start early just this one time.  (We all thought it was really shitty that the owner didn't come out of the office and made the waitress deal with this.)  Hooray for Stephanie  and thank you!  The tacos come with three preparation choices (crunchy  soft  or traditional) and 8 filling choices.  I chose portabella for one plate and black beans for another.  The traditional tacos are the best  in my opinion.  Corn tortillas  cilantro  onions  lime  and a tangy sauce.  I could only get through two plates of tacos....my friends passed me by with 4 plates.  I would defiantly go again.  Next time  we show up at 5 and I won't fill up on chips  guac  and salsa!!\n",
      "I recently visited with a group of friends both because most of us had never been  and also because Tres is a BYO. Head's up - we just made it  but as of this week  Tres is no longer a BYO! I'm not sure what the rationale behind that is because we weren't particularly impressed by the food (we ordered a variety of things from the Tres chicken to burritos to fish tacos). Beware of the online menu (not accurate) and the multiple baskets of chips and salsa they'll bring out - they charge you for anything beyond the first one if you don't cut them off! The restaurant was hardly full but the waiter did manage to mix up some of our orders as well. They do have some specials though  which make the mediocre Mexican food worth it: free margarita mix on Mondays and Taco Tuesdays  for example. Probably won't go back  but decent meal for the price.\n",
      "The hype is real. I came here on Cinco de Mayo  a busy night of course   and service was on point  minus a couple flaws. The server just forgot to give us our utensils  but besides that  everything was excellent.   The food was AMAZE BALLS. It has to be one of the best Mexican joint I've been too.    Don't bother second guessing. Come!\n",
      "My partner and I wanted to go to Superior Pasta Company but was upset when it was closed.  Driving down Christian St  we saw this Mexican place open and decided to try it out.   It was delicious!  We knew it was great just by the sauce they gave with the chips.  For entree  I got the guacamole burrito with taco sauce.  He got the bean soup and pollo papian.  Everything was so good!  We were really impressed by the prices too  mine was 9.50 for dinner tonight and lunch tomorrow!    The service is absolutely great and they even gave us 10% off cards for the next time we come.  They also have specials.  Currently  they will make margheritas if you bring in tequila on Mondays  and all you can eat tacos (not fish or shrimp) on Tuesdays.  They also have free delivery over $10 in the area.  DEFINITELY coming back here for authentic food with phenomenal service.\n",
      "I'm going plantain loco now after eating the pork and plantain burrito with guacomole added at this take out/delivery eatery.   now i'm making tostones left and right just to try to get them out of my head after eating it.   It is sooo good  and really enough for 2 meals (though i just can't stop  and eat it in 1).  It gets 5 stars since I can call an order  walk there  and usually walk in just as my order is ready.  The people are very nice.  You can pick up various mexican foods for any fiesta you might be having  and I'm going to go back to get that burrito again  and again.\n",
      "Actually 3.5 stars.   Good casual place to go with a group of friends. We were excited about the BYOT  but the watermelon margarita mix we got was kind of bland. I appreciated that it wasn't sickeningly sweet  but we ended up needing to add salt and lime to the mix to make our drinks taste better.   The food itself is pretty decent - unless you're married to the idea of flour tortillas  get the tacos and quesadillas \\traditional style\\\" with the corn tortillas. Both the shrimp and the pork were juicy and flavorful. They have a nice portobello option for your vegetarian friends too.\"\n",
      "It's just that... it's meh and I've had better.  The ambiance is a bit underwhelming and the food was just OK.   They do have decent service and food came out relatively fast as a positive footnote.    Don't see my self returning as this neighborhood has tons of great Mexican places to stop by.\n",
      "Food is ok. Nothing to write home about.   One star for their terribly rude delivery driver last night. This man gave me major attitude about wanting a dollar back for change. I wanted to give him $14 on a $10.80 order. Since when is a three dollar tip not enough? Anyways  I couldn't believe this man's audacity! To start shaking his head and mumbling under his breath because I wanted a dollar back? Sorry bro  that burrito was not worth $15  not even the $14 I did end up spending. So  thanks to your delivery driver  I will NEVER order from you again! Thanks\n",

      "Great burgers and zillion flavors milkshakes. Menu expansive w/all kinds of old school items. breakfast  lunch and open till midnight. Onion rings  fries  steak filet on burger roll  cheeseburgers  breakfast and... Prices are inexpensive. Can't go wrong. Plenty of parking and the waitstaff is fine. MILKSHAKES are super(100+) flavors. You'll like the place for eating in booth or counter... Juke box.\n",
      "It's pretty good for when your craving a burger and fries. Their smothered fries are really good  and their burgers are adequately thick and flavorful. The first bites of the burger is a grand blessing to my cravings. Only thing that bothers me is that near the end of the meal  the burger starts to taste bland with an oily texture and the flavorful fries becomes too overpower. But this is to be expected with the greasy food as my tastebuds warn me of my arteries clogging up.\n",
      "Every once in a while you go against your better instincts.  I walked into NF and there was a line to order take out.  Maybe  (I thought) this is a good greasy spoon  Wrong!.  The best thing about Niffty Fifty's is the name.  Great name!  Nothing we got as a take out order was very good.  Food was greasy and tasteless  but the worst of all and most disappointing were the ice cream based treats.  This place looks like an old fashion ice cream and hamburger joint and should excel at making ice cream treats and good quality burgers.  Maybe we hit a bad night  but we got neither.\n",
      "I was pretty upset about the breakfast I had this morning. The place was packed and I am usually understanding that busy places have slower service. Yet it took a long time before seeing our server and ordered our drinks and food at the same time. Then I later see her squeezing orange juice after she forgot one of our side orders. Sadly  she couldn't hear us very well because we were seated right next to the hectic kitchen.   Once we got our food  it was mediocre. I ordered a breakfast sandwich with scrapple and they cut the piece in half! Yet my friend ordered a side and received a whole piece. The bagel was generic  and although the sandwich was tasty enough  I would prefer a more local  divey diner to this establishment.   Don't even get me started on the joke that was the bathroom either. I couldn't believe it. The a/c dripped in me while I was peeing. Ew.   Tl dr? Go to a diner for breakfast. Go here for a milkshake. That's about it.\n",
      "I grew up coming here & this is the perfect place to indulge in. They have so many milkshake options to choose from. My favorite is Mint Oreo. As a kid  I loved the variety of sodas they offered  I was in heaven.   There is usually a wait but it goes by fast and it's fun to see the workers names and drawings on their hats. There is also a window where you can see them cutting fresh potatoes for their fries. I love this  because fresh always tastes better!   The have a decent menu  hot dogs  burgers  chicken nuggets  chicken tenders  fries  onion rings  salads & they also serve breakfast until 11 am I believe. They are open until midnight which is nice if you want a midnight snack. They are very reasonable! They also have take out if you are in a hurry.   The milkshakes are huge and it's more than enough to share with someone. I feel the same way about the fries  otherwise you will be taking food home.   If you have never been here  it is a great experience for anyone.\n",
      "Ordered the  oreo peanut butter  milkshake it was absolutely delicious and thick. the Phillies cheese stake sandwich was nice but I've had better...  Great service!\n",
      "The wait wasn't terrible  but there was definitely a wait! Took us about 20 mins to get seated but it was uphill from there.   Our waitress was quick and friendly. The Snickers milkshake is a must!!!! They serve you a frosted glass and the entire container which is atleast 2 full servings. I got partially full off of half of the milkshake before they served the food.  The Bacon Cheeseburger is a banger. The Smothered Crabmeat fries were good also  but a little salty. The Onion rings needed salt bad  they were the disappointment of the evening BUT the milkshake more then made up for it.   This was my.first  but certainly not my last because the milkshake list is fairly extensive. I'd be surprised if you don't manage to find atleast one you like.\n",
      "\n",
      "I absolutely love this place. They never Disappoint when your looking for a juicy cheeseburger  fries smothered with lots of wiz or any milkshake you can dream of!! It def hits the spot. My fav milkshake is the death by chocolate. The one thing I wouldn't get here is a cheesesteak. There is so many better places for that in Philly.\n",
      "Best milkshakes in the world and every flavor you can think of. Great for breakfast  lunch  and dinner. Oreo milkshake is a great go to\n",

      "I've been here about a dozen times over the past couple of years. It's always a fun night. I don't actually follow a lot of famous comedians  so almost every time I've gone to Helium it's because my friends and I just felt like going out for some laughs. For that  it has always delivered.  -The $5 amateur open mic every Tuesday night is a bargain! You see about 20 aspiring comedians  from polished regulars to nervous first timers - it is really a grab bag. There is still the 2-item minimum but we usually either just make that our dinner  or plan drinks and dessert there. The open mic night is never crowded either  and as I assume most the audience is the comedians' friends/family  the atmosphere is pretty supportive and good-hearted. Drawback to this is if you go frequently  you'll end up seeing a lot of the same people doing the same jokes.  -Food is OK  nothing noteworthy or unusual but it is satisfying and generously portioned. My only gripe is the salsa served with the nachos tastes like it came out of a jar. I do like to order something like nachos that will last a while  as a diversion in case things get awkward on stage.  -Service can be uneven. It's really nothing to ruin my night or keep me from returning  but I can almost count on something going wrong each time. Once I asked for an extra glass of water that was never brought. Once I asked for no jalapenos on my nachos  but there were jalapenos on my nachos. Once I asked for honey mustard for my chicken fingers  and got no sauce at all. And seems like there's almost always an issue with the checks. No matter how many times my friend and I have asked for separate checks  we are still brought a combined check or one time  separate checks but with our items mixed up and we still had to shuffle cash around. Now I always just bring cash so I can pay my friend back if necessary. Actually the last time I was there  everything went smoothly (knock on wood?).  -Also  based on experience I strongly suggest viewing the menu in advance and ordering EVERYTHING you think you'll want ALL AT ONCE  even any desserts or additional drinks. Don't count on being able to order anything additional mid-show. It's not like a restaurant where your server keeps checking on you. You'll definitely see a server at least 4 times: once before the show to order  once to bring your order to the table  once to bring your check near the end of the show  and once to collect payment. Whether you see them at any other times may depend on how busy it is and how big the crowd is. This is actually OK with me because I don't want to be interrupted a bunch of times during a show  but it is something to be aware of.  -Crowdedness - The ramp/hall to get from the main entrance down to the performance area can be a bottleneck before and after bigger shows. The showroom is packed as close as possible during popular shows too  so you may end up sharing your tiny table with strangers.  -Prices - average I guess  I usually end up spending between $25-35 on about 3 items. The fancy cocktails are around $9-11 but they are tasty and strong.  -Temperature of the showroom is always on the cold side in my opinion so bring a sweater.  -Don't get caught using your phone during the show  especially not in the front row  unless you want to get heckled! I've seen this happen and it was sooo awkward.  Overall a fun time  especially if you know what to expect before you go.\n",
      "Todd Glass was horrible. An angry man who has lost all relevance. I don't need a 20 minute dissertation about how to listen to your set. A ton of shtick and boring jokes  even the two piece band looked like they were falling asleep. We decided to leave halfway through because we enjoy comedy and he was strangling it to death. Other than that the service was great and we will be back just never to see Todd Glass.\n",
      "If I'm not going somewhere strictly for food and drinks  I generally find it hard to write a review about it.  I'll make the exception here because I've frequented this place a few times over the past month due to all sorts of events I get lured into by marketing emails.  Don't fret about the 2 drink minimum- it's really a 2 item minimum  so last night I got coffee and apple cobbler.  The apple cobbler was actually super delicious but I've heard mixed reviews about the other food (overpriced and bland).  Drinks are reasonably priced  nothing out of the ordinary- just don't expect any types of happy hour specials or deals cause they don't have any.  The waitresses are really  really on point.  I feel the need to stress that because at venues like this  they can easily get lost in the crowd and avoid you for most of the night.  But here  especially during large events (last night's was a live taping)  they made sure to staff enough people so as to accommodate everyone.  And they didn't miss a beat.  I hardly ever had to flag our girl down and she was very quick and quiet so we didn't miss the performances.   For the acts themselves  the stage is tiny and the seating is too close for comfort  but I've never had a bad time here.  The quality they churn out of this place is unexpected and fresh.  You might get a few bad seeds from time to time  but the emcees (who are usually funnier than the real acts) know how to loosen up the crowd and lighten the mood.  The venue itself is dark and outdated  but there's a nice lounge outside the viewing area to grab a drink or two before and after the performances (plus strike up a conversation with the comics!)  The swanky lighting and layout fools you into potentially turning your weeknight dinner and a show into a drunken all-nighter  so be forewarned.\n",

      "This place blows. Came here for a show. Started off with some drinks and food. Drinks sucked  food sucked  service was horrendous. Once our server dropped off our food and drinks  she disappeared. No where to be found. They have a 2 drink minimum but how am I suppose to order another drink if there's no one to take my order!??  The last comedian in the show was so terrible we wanted to leave to hit up a bar. About 10 minutes prior to the show ending  our magician server reappeared. We asked for the check but she refused to get it bc \\they were not allowed\\\" to close tabs during the show. WTF is that BS?!? The show finally ended  I closed my tab and spent about 20 min with the manager explaining to him how shitty our server and experience was. Apparently I could have went to the bar to close my tab  of course our server didn't tell us that. The manager was very nice and tried to comp me with freebies. I declined bc I have no intention to ever return here.\"\n",

      "Great little comedy joint in the heart of the city. There's not really get a bad seat in the house--a nice view from all angles. There's a sign that says two-drink min. but they don't really check so sit back  relax and enjoy the show. Plus  the food here is pretty good too.   Beware it can get crowded and if you're seeing a show that's running Thurs-Sat.--go on Thurs  the tickets are usually the cheapest!\n",
      "I only can't give 5 since I did not see a show but I can't wait to. Was in town with Craig Robinson and the Nasty Delicious and the staff  venue  vibe  food  drinks  and all the rest was amazing. Made me proud to be from Philly and I can't wait to get back to support some local acts. helium you rock such a great night!\n",
      "I enjoyed the show at Helium  however  the \\security\\\" is rude and awful. My friends and I were enjoying the show and laughing and this representative of the Helium Establishment came up to us twice about \\\"talking\\\"... We were laughing at the show. He ruined the show for us and I may never come to an event here again. It's a shame that Helium cannot employ people that know what comedy is and permit people to enjoy the event. This person was a nuisance and ruined my night.\"\n",

      "I always wanted to have a water view & bridge view of this beautiful city of Philadelphia My hometown.Today was our anniversary!Made reservations at the last minute and requested a bridge view.Maybe?We were treated like VIP'S as soon as we walked in.Staff was so very professional and attentive.The Manager stopped at every table to make sure everyone was \\Happy\\\".Awesome view food was outstanding!This is our new #1 in Philly dinning!Our sever Rochelle knew both our names and treated us like family.Me and my boyfriend have never had such an amazing dinner.Highly recommend!!!\"\n",
      "I stopped after work for a light dinner at the bar. The wine by glass menu was very small and my first choice which was the headliner special was not available wouldn't you know it. So I paid $11 for a 6 oz pour which I thought looked small but I'm sure everyone is used to the pour we make our selves at home. Anyway on to the calamity. I ordered the calamari which tasted delicious and was lightly fried with peppers and jalapeños. Two hours later I was cursing the my choice and I continued to pay for it ALL night long. Needless to say I won't be back to any Chart house restaurants after this intestinal event. When thinking back on it  I was the only person eating ....hmmmmm\n",
      "I came here expecting a high class dining experience. However  I found myself a bit disappointed. The view was extremely pretty. The food was good  but not extraordinary in any way. The server was nice enough  but he wasn't particularly outstanding otherwise.   The part that really got my goat  however  was the long wait for my food. There was barely anybody at the restaurant  but it still took a full hour for the appetizer to arrive. It took at least another thirty minutes for the entrees to appear. When they did  I was mildly disappointed. The food was not worth the exorbitant price tag attached to it. The most dismal part of my experience   however  was the fact that they ran out of their world famous mud pies. I was really disappointed and shocked. Overall  I do not recommend this restaurant because it fails to live up to its high price tag.\n",
      "Came here for Thanksgiving dinner. Reservations for 6:15 and it was after 6:30 before we were seated. The plated thanksgiving dinner was good.  It had your typical thanksgiving foods: turkey  stuffing  cranberries and your choice of mashed potatoes or a baked sweet potato. Dessert was choice of pecan or pumpkin pie. Neither worth coming back for.\n",
      "Food was definitely overrated. So was the experience.  It was nice being on the water  and the restaurant decor was nice  but it just wasn't all that great.  Service seemed annoyed the entire time like we were asking the waiter to do more than what his job entails.  High prices don't match the quality of the food  nor the service.. Oh well.\n",
      "Our Chart House  Philly experience was fantastic!  We'll be back soon!\n",
      "There's enough to like about Charthouse. The sea bass and crab stuffed mushrooms were perfectly prepared and the service was great. The view is cool too..good for date night.\n",
      "\n",
      "First time trying this place out. Went for happy hour on a rainy day. I had firecracker shrimp  prime rib sliders  and some chicken lettuce wraps. All good but definitely get the firecracker shrimps at least\n",
      "Came in here on a Sunday night because Zavino had a long wait. What a find! Food came out quickly  typical tapas style  a plate or two at a time. After ordering about 8 items  nothing we had was bad  but here are our favorites:  lasagna is a must-try!  also the broccoli avocado  tuna  and ravioli. Nice place  we'll definitely be back.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love the ambiance of this place  the hostess is super friendly and welcoming.  We tried the lasagna verde  four cheese ravioli's and chicken meatballs. The ravioli's were so good you get 4 of them and we ate them so fast. The lasagna came second and that was delicious aswell  the chicken meatballs were okay I realize I much prefer beef meatballs but they're not bad.   Overall it was a really great experience I'd love to go back. It was about $42 for 2 people and 3 'small' plates that filled us both up.\n",
      "At the corner of 13th and Samson sits a dense population of fun and high-quality restaurants - Tredici Enoteca  run by the same group as Zavino  makes an excellent addition to the area.  We stopped by for a late  light weeknight dinner. The space is modern  open  and simply decorated  and the place had a wait  even at 8:40pm on a Wednesday! Our waiter was knowledgeable and the dishes we ordered  though small  were surprisingly filling. The restaurant does get quite noisy  which made it difficult to hear our waiter at times  but overall  we enjoyed our experience.  The menu is carb-heavy: we ordered the verde lasagna  which might be the best lasagna I've ever had (the ricotta had an incredible half melty  half-fluffy texture)  the mushroom toast  which was also delicious  the roasted cauliflower  and the fried goat cheese  which while good  was not anything special.   Tredici is known for their wide and reasonably-priced wine list  but we were in the mood for cocktails  and they did not disappoint. We both ordered the gin-based mora  which tasted like juice but was very  very strong.  I loved how shareable the dishes were  and was shocked at how full we were at the end of the meal despite ordering what felt like very small dishes. There were many main dishes on the menu that looked awesome as well. It's definitely a solid hangout option  and with their outdoor sidewalk seating  I'm sure it''ll become one of my summer favorites.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite \\Italian\\\" restaurants in the city currently. The reason I have Italian in quotes being that this is a Mediterranean/Italian/Raw-bar hybrid in my eyes (or through my taste buds) and offers a wonderfully diverse menu that covers all the bases of what I want in a meal (be it alone  in the corner with my adult coloring books and a glass (or 8) of Caymus or with a group of people who stubbornly accept my company).   The decor of this place is SPOT ON. The design team and staff REALLY did their homework and brought to life something completely unique  fun and impressive that honestly I didn't know if they were going to be able to pull off using the space that they had. There isn't one person I've taken who hasn't been impressed by this aspect of the place.   As far as food is concerned  this place does everything delightfully simply yet with flavor that normally accompanies a much more complicated dish. The Mediterranean tasting board is completely incredible and has maybe the best falafel I've ever had in the world on it along with some really tasty hummus and a few other great items (a quinoa tabbouleh and some marinated vegetables with some fresh grilled bread drizzled with olive oil that  rumor has it could have been drizzled and collected off of one of the Victoria's Secret models...its THAT good). The pasta dishes are all simple yet taste great and same goes for their various entree style meats/birds/fishes...the bronzino is definitely one of my favorites.   The bar is fantastic there and has maybe some of my favorite \\\"stools\\\"/chair/throne things that are at any restaurant. They do half glasses of wines which really rocks if you want to sample various wines and have a really awesome cocktail program. It's also one of the only places I can even get Caymus by the glass...which is a big plus for me.   Service wise  this is one of the best places in town. The management is stellar  and the staff are equally as amazing. Everyone seems to love what they do and it adds to the positive energy of the place. This is a GREAT place with GREAT people. Do yourself a favor and put it on your \\\"places to eat list\\\" ASAP.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I wasn't completely sure what to expect here  but the reviews seemed good and I wanted to give it a try. The feel of Tredici is upscale urban chic. The concept is Italian/Mediterranean tapas.   As a vegetarian  there were a ton of options to try. The small plates were brought out one at a time and staggered which was great for tasting and not feeling overwhelmed with what was on the table.   We tried the saffron arancini  mushroom toast  broccoli and avocado   roasted cauliflower  Israeli couscous  and the Mediterranean tasting board. Everything was very good  fresh  and flavorful. The stand outs for me were the arancini  mushroom toast and the cauliflower.   Service was good. Food was great. The noise levels were a little louder than expected but this place was pretty full for a weekday night.  They don't take reservations so be prepared for a wait or a drink at the bar until a table opens.\n",

      "My hubby and I have been heading to this bar almost every Friday for two years now. The friendships we have made with Danny  Fergus  Neil  Everton  and Karrie mean so much to us. We look forward to seeing them  catching up and having some good laughs. They also just happen to make the best drinks in the city and the atmosphere is authentic and fun. Great food (MUST get Truffle Fries) although I do wish there were more vegetarian vegan options. Hint Hint Owen! :-)\n",
      "Masterful cocktails  knowledgable and FRIENDLY staff  terrific food and you can't beat the laid back vibe in what can be a raucous area of Old City. A locals fav.\n",
      "The best of the best for cocktails. Yummy snacks. Ladies bathroom is plush  big enough for a private party. Absolutely love the early 20th century Parisian Euro vibe of this place. Old tiles  old tin ceiling  gorgeous dilapidated feeling. You will feel regal and at home at the same time in this place. Enjoy!\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a big fan of the Sass.  Great food  great beers  friendly service in the olde historic Philly.\n",
      "Went here early on a Saturday night. Bartenders were amiable and poured a good gin martini. One of the owners  Neil  was super friendly and even attempted to make one of my homegrown cocktails: a Hendricks ginger beer infusion. I had a salad as I was still full from a fantastic brunch and it was good. All in all a good experience. Nothing really to brag about but I'll definitely be back when I'm in the mood for a classic cocktail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great little bar w/ food. Loved the intimate nighttime vibe of low-lighting and candles at the tables. Very chill and relaxing vibe  and good selection of tunes in the background.  A small but tasty and unique menu. Same goes for the draft beer list - small but a nice unique selection. The staff was fantastic. I would be here all the time if I lived here.\n",
      "This is a cute place to hang out and eat.  The ambiance was warm and cozy.  The food was decent  but in my opinion  a little on the bland side.  I had the carbonara  and I've definitely had a lot better around the same price range.  With that said  the food was still good and the service was good.\n",
      "I love the music at Sass on the week nights. ITs a great romantic getaway that changes up the typical happy hour feel. Even if you're not hitched up  it's a classy yet relaxing vibe. Definitely reminiscent of the prohibition era. But damn  is it pricey!\n",
      "The best soon-dubu in the city!  This place is tucked away and once you walk in  it's like you've stepped into a Korean home.  Very welcoming  warm and inviting.  It's very vegetarian friendly!  The soft tofu is stewed and put into the dol sot pots which each and every stew feels like it's custom made for you.   You can select from beef  seafood or mixed meats (seafood & beef)  mushroom  and just plain.  They can adjust the spice as needed too.  I always get the extra hot with the hot temperature  can't beat it.  The rice also comes in a dol-sot which is great if you leave it in for a while  it burns the rice into a nice crispy shell.  DROOL.  Just thinking about this place makes my mouth salivate!    If you're not into tofu  they also offer korean bbq meats (cooked in the back)  with other soup/stew items.  Love this place!!!\n",
      "The best ten dollar lunch in America  hands down. Banchan city  crack that egg into your volcano like five pepper pork soft tofu and go crazy. The parking lot scares me  but the place is the best. Go there. Staff not so much miserable as maybe not fluent? I dunno  I always figure it's because I'm a round eye.\n",
      "We drive out of town to Philadelphia just to eat here. We have been here many times over the past 5 years. I can only say that the tofu soup (and everything else)  here always tastes so good. They always get the spiciness right  and we have never had a complaint here! This is a must-try in Philadelphia if you're a fan of Korean food.\n",
      "For what it is I think it's fantastic. The menu is very limited.  The service: 4/5 The service was fair but I wouldn't necessarily say it was incredible. I didn't experience anything special with their service but most importantly I didn't have any complains.  The food: 3/5 Due to the size of the menu  your selections are very limited. I wasn't a fan of any of the apps except for the korean pancake. The kimchi and side dishes I thought were pretty fair. The soft tofu there I thought was pretty good especially for $10. But on top of that the level of spiciness you can request is awesome! The protein in the soft tofu I think are lacking and it's very subtle. You'd forget what you had ordered because their would be only one or two pieces.   The atmosphere: 5/5  The interior design of the restaurant is fantastic. It gave a more authentic korean dining experience.   The tofu house is a cute establishment and a great quiet spot to take a date or a small group of friends out to. I have gone back multiple times and enjoyed myself each time.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite place to get soft tofu and the seafood pancake! My dad doesn't like tofu so he gets the barbecue beef which he claims to be delicious!   My family and friends all like coming here for gatherings. The decor reminds me of an Ancient Korean drama with its wooden benches  calligraphy and masks hanging on the walls. The waiters and waitresses are dressed in korean outfits too. It's pretty cute! My parents also like that they are able to communicate with some of the waitresses who also speak chinese.\n",
      "I love this place!  The side dishes come out fast  and they are very fresh.  The service is good too.  For the amount of food you get  you can't beat the price.  $10 for the most yummy tofu stew.\n",
      "This place has become one of my favorites! I am always here with friends and its so close to a few of our houses so its perfect. I've even brought the family over to try it and they enjoyed it very much. I've tried many things on their menu and most are very good but my go-to-favorite is my Kimchi Beef  medium spicy. So delicious and worth the money. A must try for anyone looking to try something new whether you like it spicy or not  since you tell them how you want it. I rarely give five stars but this place deserves it - wonderful staff as well  always polite and a pleasure to be back.\n",
      "If you like soon do bu (soft tofu soup with meat)  I highly recommend this place. I couldn't give it 5 stars because there was not enough meat. I got the seafood tofu and there was like 2 shrimps and 2 clams in the entire soup. Soon do bu was only $10 for any kind (maybe that's why there wasn't much meat?). Broth is delicious. I recommend cracking the raw egg and mixing it  into the broth.   I also got the galbi  it was really flavorful!\n",
      "Came on a Tuesday evening with some friends. Place was pretty empty. As always  we ordered the soon dubu which is a must if you come here. The tofu is so silky and soft. We ordered the seafood soon dubu. There was barely any seafood (two shrimps  two oysters  two mussels). We also ordered the jap chae  the kalbi  Beef dolsot  and the seafood pancake. I would return for the soon dubu  everything else was okay.\n",
      "I am feeling smitten after spending Valentine's Day with my boyfriend and my love affair on the side  Fond.  We had the 3-course tasting menu  which provided me with just enough of a tease to want to go back for more.  To start I had a mushroom soup amuse bouche  followed by a roasted beet salad  then seared skate wing  an interlude with some mulled wine sorbet  and ending with the beurre noisette cheesecake.  The roasted beet salad was my favorite part of the meal and if I go back I will likely order it again.  It came with slightly salty seasoned arugula  goat cheese  and sweet walnuts.  The combination was perfect together.  My favorite part of the seared skate wing dish was in fact not the skate wing  but the lemon risotto with edamame and soy brown butter.  My boyfriend had the rack of lamb  which was so tender and delightful.  However  yet again  I was more impressed with his sides as well.  The whole grain mustard spaetzle was fried...uhhh best thing ever.  I strongly recommend eating here for a special occasion  considering the price (it is well worth the cost).  It is kind of small  but once you sit down you hardly even notice the size.  I'm sure during the summer it will be a whole lot easier to get around  considering I won't have a mammoth parka to lug around.\n",
      "Absolutely amazing. Went for the first time on Valentine's Day and didn't have the best experience. The owner Lee followed up and we came back for a redo and this was AMAZING. Now I totally get what all the hype is about. The follow up and interaction with Lee was great  our server was fantastic  every item of food was delicious. We are already talking about when we can go back and also sending my in laws there as well. This is what I was expecting and it exceeding expectations. Grilled duck hearts  lobster risotto  hanger steak  skate  and two delicious desserts. Will be back (often) and will send others as well. Highly recommend! This place is a MUST visit. Thank you Lee and team for showing us what Fond is all about.\n",
      "Just wrapped up a fabulous birthday dinner here and had such a nice experience I couldn't wait to write a review. Gracious  attentive service and wonderful food. We went with the five course chef's tasting and loved every bite. The wine pairings that came with it were all really excellent. At $62 for the five courses (plus an amuse bouche  a palate-cleansing intermezzo  and a final minty meringue) and $25 for the wine pairings  I think it was a good value  and well worth the splurge. Particularly memorable  I think  will be the chicken liver mousse  but there was not a bad morsel to be had. I'd happily celebrate another special event here. Thanks Fond!\n",
      "This was mine and 7 friend's choice for our second restaurant week dinner.  $30 for 4 courses. 8 of us get there and our table isn't quite ready yet so we stand outside and wait 5 minutes. One of the owners offered to open our wine for us or get us water while we waited  which I thought was very kind even though we declined and said we would just wait.   We didn't wait much more than 5 minutes.  The place was small and cozy  a little too cozy at points considering there wasn't much room for the waiters to walk through the tables but it was fine if you were sitting down! haha  I can imagine that'd get annoying for people trying to walk around.   Anyway  food... was delicious! The soup was a squash soup which was creamy and buttery and really tasty.  I was the only one that chose the beet salad over the asparagus dish. I was trying to be adventurous. Mine had feta cheese  almonds and greens. I liked it but I wish there was some sort of vinaigrette on it (or more - I think there was some on the beets). I would have preferred a bit more of a kick  a bit more flavor.   The chef sent out a complimentary spoon of tuna tar tar which was so good! Thanks chef!  For the main course I got the salmon on top of a cake of angel hair pasta  green beans and a light sauce. The salmon was perfect  the pasta cake was a bit strange. I would have preferred the pasta simply cooked and put on the side because I think when made into a cake  some of the pasta was overcooked  but it sure looked good as a cake. I would have also preferred a bit more of the sauce also  it was so good.  And for dessert I got a warm brownie with cinnamon caramel custard  whipped milk chocolate cream  and cinnamon pecans. It was a great dessert  I loved it because it wasn't too sweet. It was just right.  So overall  everything was extremely delicious. I guess if I was the chef  I personally would have executed a couple things differently but I'm sure a lot of people would have been perfectly happy with how things were done.   As for the service  our waiter was awesome  he lended us his iphone so we could keep track of the phillies game. And the owner was very attentive and made sure to describe all the food to us as it was brought out. The chef even made an appearance at the end of the dinner  which you don't see often. It was a pleasant surprise and we were able to thank him in person.   Overall  I highly recommend this place and I will be going back.\n",
      "We came by to try the anniversary tasting menu  and it was fantastic. It's probably one of the best meals I've had in recent memory  and the prices are very reasonable. I'll definitely be back to try some of their other dishes.\n",
      "I had a phenomenal meal here.   The space is a little tight and the food blew me out of the water.   We came on a week night  armed with wine which we later found out they are not BYO but we're able to drink what we brought.  Our server was awesome and very knowledgeable.   Here's what I ordered and loved.  Lobster Risotto (hazelnuts  truffle) Beef Short Rib (caramelized onion spaetzle  Brussels sprouts  sauce Bordelaise)  I can say I'm  Fond of Fond and can't wait to come back.\n",
      "An exceptional meal! We (accidentally) ate at the chef's table tonight  and everything was perfect. For appetizers  we shared the steak tartare  the seared fois gras  and the hamachi ceviche. All were stunning. For entrees  we had the filet mignon  lamb stroganoff (with extra shaved black truffle)  and the scallops. Each was more spectacular than the last. Couldn't have been happier. Will definitely come back to Philly (from NY) to eat at this restaurant again!\n",
      "I love this neighborhood and visiting Fond for the first time was a reminder that I need to play in this part of the city more often.  Fond is a BYO during the week  but has a full bar for the weekend crowd.  I did see a few people bring in their own bottles  so I assume there is a corking fee on Friday and Saturday.    The place is cozy  so if you're someone who gets claustrophobic  then you may want to head somewhere else. You will literally be sitting on top of your neighbor  but what better way to make some new pals?  We started with the wild boar pate  which was actually quite delicious  considering I had no idea what pate was.  My husband and I both got the pork belly for the main course and this was some of the best pork belly I have ever eaten.  The top was crispy and the meat was tender.  It comes with a side of sweet potatoes that are to die for.   For dessert I had the malted chocolate ice cream with peanut brittle  which was seriously the best combination ever.  My sweet tooth enjoyed it thoroughly.  Overall  a great place for dinner  but it will cost you.  Save this spot for a special celebration.  Unless you win the lottery - then come here often.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful.  This place is a must try.  Fond  perfectly situated on the corner of 11th and Tasker is a little gem serving up some of the most delicate  flavorful dishes in Philadelphia.  The restaurant is very small and seating is tight but the ambiance is quaint and cozy.   Beginnings: Olive or sourdough bread for the table accompanied by salted butter which was fantastic.   Later came a warm mushroom soup amuse bouche- creamy  warm  and perfect for a cold night in January.  Appetizers: Two appetizers to start  the lobster risotto - a MUST TRY and the chicken liver mousse.  The lobster risotto was so delicate.  The risotto was cooked perfectly and there was ample lobster to go around.  One of my favorites of the evening.  The chicken liver mousse had two big portions of mousse accompanied by toasted sourdough bread. Wow.   I told our server  I would easily be able to call it a 5 star night after the appetizers alone. P.S-    While we are on the topic of servers  our server was Tory and he was helpful  attentive and just what the night called for. Also - 5 stars.   Entrée:   I was torn between the artic char and the pork belly.   Tory suggested the pork belly and it did not disappoint.  Holy moly.  The pork was cooked to perfection.  It delivered a crispy outside and tender  melt in your mouth center.  It was served with some of the best sweet potatoes I've ever had (Okinawa sweet potatoes)   escarole and Dijon jus. Portions were perfect.   I also tried the short rib which was out of this world.   (Note: both of these entrees are on their newly released restaurant week menu so if you're looking for a top notch meal on the cheap and have been meaning to check out Fond- stop reading this and get your reservation on the books!)  Dessert: \\We have a dessert special this evening... salted caramel cheesecake with our chocolate chip crust and our homemade vanilla bean whip cream\\\" Excuse me??? YES. YES  I will have that.   There was a bite left and I'm almost positive I heard the Mortal Kombat voice whisper \\\"FINISH HIM\\\"--you always listen to the Mortal Kombat voice.   Fond is delectable.\"\n",
      "This place has such a nice atmosphere that I want to come back there every weekend. The best Mexican food that I ever tried. Service is really great  drinks  well  actually everything about this place is just great  awesome  warm  happy. Will be back soon!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Wow!!!! Amazing food. Ive had Mexican cuisine in all parts of the us and Mexico and this place is great. Well balanced dishes  great service and try the coffee. I will definitely recommend this place and come back frequently.\n",
      "Saw this place on FYI Philly and had to check it out.  We got the specials which were a shrimp corn cilantro and chorizo mix and prime rib with chimichurri and jalapeño mashed potatoes.  The flavor was amazing.    I loved the two different salsas: smoky or green sweet.  Both amazing.  We will be back\n",
      "I do not like Mexican food except for quesadillas and nachos.  This place changed my mind. I used to hate tacos especially the authentic ones with the double corn tortilla.  The carnitas tacos here with the cilantro tortillas are bangin!\n",
      "Coming from California  it was really hard to find a Mexican restaurant that was comparable to the food in the West Coast.   With that being said  Blue Corn  has the best tacos in Philly. Closest thing to Tacos from California. Not only are the tacos great  the chicken soup is amazing  and ceviche was fresh. Chips and salsa and guacamole were flavorful as well.   Staff are extremely friendly  and the restaurant itself is clean and has great ambiance. This is my third time here and each time the food and service has been consistent.\n",
      "I cannot wait to go back. I'm definitely kicking myself for letting this spot in my backyard go unnoticed for so long! Blue tacos were the best I've ever had  also tasted the Cubana sandwich  which is borderline too big (might be the equivalent of an entire loaf of bread) but is nevertheless absolutely delicious. Drinks were reasonably priced and very good! Cash only but there is an atm with possibly the lowest fee in the area.\n",
      "Best Mexican food I've ever had. I had the pork tacos and they were incredible. Flavorful  fresh  and just the right amount of spice. The prices are low too. I will definitely go back and it will be soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mi novio y yo came for lunch today and had a wonderful meal and experience. We wanted to try it becsuse of all the positive reviews and trust me guys-they do not lie! Ive been to a ton of mexican places and can always find something to complain about BUT everything was good and omg order the flan.   We had a brisket appetizer  both had the carne asada con nopale  coco y tamarindo agua frescas y flan for dessert. Best flan ive had. Carne asada is worth every penny.  Usually i go to places and get a carne asada and its the cheap  thin  tough steak. This is a fatty (where the flavor comes from) rib eye steak  nice and juicy and full of flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The location is great. You can get there by foot from Center City or public transportation  and  you can park your car underground. The food is a yummy mix of traditional and non-traditional. I loved the vegetarian burger and eggplant fries.  I did not like the quinoa salad  although I usually like quinoa  it had so much mint in it  I felt I fell in my compost pile.  The ice cream with bacon has a terrible texture  and might be the only ice cream I dislike.  But  this is not the bad part.  The wait staff is terrible. They are rude at the front end  and they are rude when they serve you. We waited a horribly long time to get our dessert  too. There was no explanation  but it was almost thrown at us as we were deciding whether it was time to leave (we assumed they had forgotten it and it was getting late).    Worst of all  they added a gratuity into my bill without me knowing it. I did not realize the tip was added into the bill  and I tipped the rude waitress with cash. Therefore  she got a 38% tip when she deserved 38 cents.  I would not go to the World Cafe Live unless I was going for the entertainment and was certain it was worth my time and expense.\n",
      "What a great location and venue! Saw Radical Face here and I couldn't be more pleased with the whole experience. Getting into the venue was a breeze  not over packed inside and 5 dollar IPAs. My only complaint  and this is a product of me aging  is that there are not any seats or a balcony.\n",
      "We saw Philly Gumbo last night and they were amazing. Absolutely worth seeing again anytime. Great mix of blues  Caribbean and rock. Go if you can because you'll have a great time. The food was lovely and we enjoyed every bit of it. Highly recommend. A perfect venue.\n",
      "Venue was easy to find with a little preparation via Google Maps.  Parking in the lower level lot operated by UPENN was a breeze and only cost $10 for the night.  Made it to the upper bar in time for happy hour and enjoyed $3 Yuengling Lager pints.  Made our way downstairs for Stephen Kellogg and the Sixers  and the venue couldn't have been better.  The acoustics and atmosphere were great and the service at the dowstairs bar was quick and friendly.  I'll certainly be returning to the World Cafe next time a show announcement catches my eye!\n",
      "Jonathan Coulton from a VIP seat: best concert experience ever.  The acousitcs are fabulous  the price is low  the atmosphere and service attentive.  No downside.\n",
      "Upstairs-  Incredible if you are with a group  and have a table in a good spot.   The area in front of the band is in a bad spot.  The kitchen doors are right by the band  so if you are in front of the stage  you have to dodge guys carrying trays all night.  Very awkward.  It seems to have a lot of great bands upstairs that don't sell too many tickets.     Downstairs-  Overall typical of this type of venue.  Big floor  great balcony  a little tough to get a drink if the show is packed.    During the week there's always a special on some kind of beer.  Otherwise drink prices are high  but not atypical of this kind of a place.  I never tried any food.  Seems to have one great band after another upstairs and downstairs all year long.\n",
      "one of my favorite places in philly!  I've been here three times  and it functions as so much -- the upstairs features local or new artists  usually free or a small cover charge  and the downstairs is a true concert venue that brings in musicians from everywhere.  the upstairs is this mesh between a restaurant bar area and has a low stage which is great b c if you're sitting close enough  you'll be right next to the artist.  the servers are always fun and outgoing  and the drinks are great.  food is pretty good  could be a little bit cheaper. def a spot to hit if you want live music and  good night out.  make sure to check the website to see who's performing and cost before you go.\n",
      "As far as I am concerned the CUSTOMER SERVICE there is horrible! NOT TO MENTION the FALSE ADVERTISING LISTED ON THEIR WEBSITE when getting ready to purchase tickets. Pay close attention the part where they say you can save $2 in cash only to show up at the box office and be told that there is still a $3 processing fee and that it will cost you extra if you pay by credit card!   Another misrepresentation is that the price of the ticket is listed at $25 under the artists show but when you proceed to purchase tickets you are being charged $26 plus a $5 processing fee. BELOW IT STATES SAVE $2 when purchasing with cash at the box office. I was under the impression that I would pay $25/$26 not $28 or $31 by arriving to purchase at the box office. The girl sitting at the cash register told me it was a MISUNDERSTANDING. NO IT IS MISREPRESENTATION!!!!!!!!!   I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE to ANYONE!   I wasn't asking for a free ticket. I only wanted them to honor what was stated on their website. Instead  the whole experience turned out to be very disdainful.   All I wanted was to easily purchase tickets to the ESTELLE show  an artist that I love listening to.  Instead my whole experience at WORLD CAFE LIVE was ruined by this one circumstance .

      "I saw a show at the downstairs venue.  It was much bigger than I thought.  The crowd was a bit rude--the girl sitting across from us brought her own food (yogurt!).  I'd heard that the sound was bad  but it was pretty good.  Most of all  the prices for the shows aren't that bad.  The staff were all incredibly friendly  from the box office guys to the door staff to the waitresses.  Maybe it's this way all over Philadelphia  but after the pouty if-you-aren't-famous-I-don't-have-time-for-you staff at a lot of LA venues  the WCL crew are a welcome change!\n",
      "The food was good  not great  the atmosphere was fun and lvively. Drinks were large and wine list was pleasing.\n",
      "I went here last night with some of my friends. Good place  but nothing to RAVE over. I got the beet and goat cheese salad which was sub par. The vegetable platter was amazing though! Huge! Good place to go with friends  but nothing AMAZING. Good location and we sat outside!\n",
      "Delicious plates! Well stocked bar and a nice array of beers make this Rustic corner spot a must go to. You can tell the chef has a great grasp of food and also a wonderful  exciting and colorful concept for their dishes. Happy hour specials are great too!\n",
      "Beer list is good and the bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly. Food was ok. Wings were small and blah. The burger  which is the yardstick of civilization  was way over cooked. Ordered medium well and was burned.\n",
      "One of my favorite places to come to on a warm evening. The food is delicious  drinks are far from weak and the staff are some of the friendliest I've ever encountered. As I already said  I prefer sitting outside (good for people watching)  however love sitting in the pub area as well. Looking forward to visiting again this summer!!\n",
      "I fell upon this great little pub after a tour at ESP. What a find! Excellent food and interesting beers. The atmosphere was perfect. To the man at the table next to us (Saturday 12 28 about 2pm) with the blue sweater-if your date was not successful  PLEASE look me up!\n"

      "This place is great! We happened upon it accidentally on a Saturday morning but will definitely be back. Lots of outdoor seating  nice brunch menu  excellent Bloody Mary bar !! Friendly staff too. We had hummus and a bomb diggity kale salad. I'm a vegetarian so only a few options for brunch but they seem very accommodating.  We will be back!\n",
      "We stopped here for post-dinner drinks after eating at Bridgid's. I can't speak to the food (since we didn't order any)  but the bar was pretty nice. We got there at around 10pm on a Saturday night and it wasn't that busy. We got a table near the bar and had plenty of room.  The beer selection was good (a requisite for me). I got a Brooklyn Pilsner and enjoyed it. The service was OK - a little slow  but the waitress was pleasant.   The only thing I wasn't crazy about was that there was a table with middle-aged people making out right next to our table - I mean really making out  not just like a kiss here and there. I found this to be somewhat egregious. This is really not the restaurant's fault  but I just figured I would mention it so if it happens to you  I can say 'I told you so.'  Overall  I would consider coming back.\n",
      "nice restaurant  but small. the lighting is not good for us 40+...smile. there were 6 of us and we were at a back table  quite snug. I had buffalo wings & fries  which were good. they could have taken the tips off though. my family members had salmon  a burger  & duck. they enjoyed their meals.  I may be back for the wings.\n",
      "I was coming from a long day at the Eastern State Penitentiary so I looked around the neighborhood for a unique place to eat at. Stumbled upon this place and thought it was cute and cozy. It definitely had an antique bar vibe. The waitress bartender was really nice. The food was average. I got the grilled chicken and brie sandwich. It was good but the honey mustard was more overwhelming than I expected...I think it was horseradish sauce because definitely tasted like wasabi and burned my nostrils! The fries were good (well seasoned). My boyfriend got a lackluster omelet and a big bowl of mussels. The mussels were okay. Overall cute neighborhood cafe.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would definitely would recommend this place for people looking for a hot pot and bbq place in the northeast. The wait is crazy almost 2 hours but if you leave your name  they will text you when your table is ready. The portion is small but its all you can eat so you can keep ordering.\n",
      "Walked in for my friend's birthday  Aiden made sure everything was 10 10. +1 for the personal hot pot spaces on the tables.\n",
      "Favorite hot pot place ever ever ever! Great selection and it's fun  supppper clean   loud and plays EDM. The people are very nice and attentive. Im coming back every week.\n",
      "On mother's day night  i went in with my family  I gave a call in advance to check availability  I knew they must be busy since it was because of prime time   like around 7pm. Woman on the phone informed us that the waiting time was 35mins which was doable  We arrived in the place within 30 mins. Place was packed! Full of people in the waiting area.  When we got to the reception desk  they told us 2-3 hours of waiting time. 30 mins ago  it was 35mins wait. But within that time frame  increased to 2-3hours?? And she just laughed and said customers were kept coming. Should have told us honestly then we wouldnt have driven for 40mins to get there We ended up going crappy chinese restaurant nearby that was not worth paying for.\n",
      "Kpot at Franklin Mills Mall was BANGING!!   The food is great  the price is fair but it's mainly the location  having a spot like this CLOSE to us is so great. They're probably doing mad well by their location alone. It's pretty much the common response by all my friends in Bucks County that not only is it good but its close.   Overall very satisfied w this spot. The big question is 'is it better than Seorabol in Northeast?' and thats rough. It's all you can eat which I prefer and being newer  the building is really nice. For me personally  the All you can eat factor is what makes this spot the winner. Food quality is equal.   Nice having some updated Kpop to dance along with while l eat. This is already becoming a spot where you run into your friends when you go. One of my friends has gone there 4 times in 8 days already.   If you wanna save a few bucks  go for lunch but some items are Dinner Only menu which when you see which items  you'll probably want to go for dinner to be honest.\n",
      "Went to K-Pot on the grand opening weekend since then we been there 4 times. For all the foodies out there this is a place to go  the variety of food they have is pretty good. We've been in others Korean bbq restaurants where the meats and veggies are limited but not here. Honest opinion this restaurant will meet your desires  highly recommended you do either BBQ alone or the pot alone  if you combined them (which there's nothing wrong by doing so) we believe is way to much food. They have a station to make your own marinating sauce and they have different seasoning guide you could use to have a perfect Korean experience. The ambience is good  side note the music maybe they might have to turn down a bit not too much because all 4 times we went to the restaurant having a conversation on the table could be challenging as  you could be screaming to the person in front of you so they can hear you. Other than that i rate 5 stars on Yelp  because: food  staff  location  parking  price.\n",
      "This is probably one of my favorite places to go in Philly. It has my favorite things  hot pot and kbbq. The service is extremely fast and by the time I was done picking my sauces  most of the things were already on the table. everything was quite delicious and the staff was very friendly. my server  ryan asked nearly every time he passed my table if we were doing alright  if we needed to change our grill  etc.  which was very well appreciated. They also had sago soup which I had never seen any other asian restaurant have. Overall  we had a great time here.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The food here needs so much help.  I have ordered the mac and cheese twice and both times it's been a disaster. The first time it was cold  which I thought might have been the cause for the diminished flavor. The second time  it was warm and I realized whether warm or cold  it has absolutely no flavor. I apologize if this sounds mean  especially since I believe the chef might be a young kid and I'd hate to hurt his/her feelings. When I think of the mac and cheese dish  I picture a junior high school student coming home after school  cooking up the Kraft blue box mac  and then sprinkling Goldfish crackers on top. Other food items have also been ordered  but nothing would ever be repeated.   \\There's an old saying in Tennessee -- I know it's in Texas  probably in Tennessee -- that says  fool me once  shame on -- shame on you. Fool me -- you can't get fooled again.\\\"   That said  please just go here for bar food and beers. Avoid the brunch dining experience.\"\n",
      "Our go to local bar!! My boyfriend & I love it here. We typically always sit at the bar & have great service. Beers are always rotating & have a great selection.  Food is good too. Nothing crazy but good fresh bar type food with some healthier options thrown in there if you are into them - which I am! Check it out  you won't be disappointed.\n",
      "Meh. We live nearby and were pleased to see a seemingly decent spot open up. It appeared completely out of character for the South Street area (which is AWFUL and most locals hate) so we had high hopes.Headed over for dinner/drinks on a Saturday night a few weeks later.  Certainly a decent beer selection and the bartenders were pleasant enough  but they missed the point of food service. They took our order and delivered when it came out of the kitchen  but were complete ghosts otherwise (even when standing directly in front of us chatting with other staff.) Unfortunately  our food was disappointing  too. We ordered 2 apps to munch on and maybe ate 1/3 of each. The calamari remoulade was inedible it was so spicy (we really enjoy spicy food) and the mac & cheese bland and lukewarm. We reluctantly ordered entrees thinking they might surprise us - should have known better. We had the pulled pork sandwich and salmon. Both were unremarkable  the pork dry.  Neighbors in SH/QV are hungry for nice options near home and ready to spend without needing to go across town. Considering the aforementioned local landscape  perhaps a greater focus on staff training and menu development than a fancy facade and a massive beer selection could start to fill that void.\n",
      "Went there for Sunday brunch. First of all  it wasn't busy at 1 pm. Beer selection was great! Food was great! We had the burger on French toast and an omelet. The French toast burger was amazing! The omelet was an omelet but hey...nice and fluffy. We will be back.\n",
      "Great spot for happy hour! Nice happy hour menu  I had $5 margaritas. Which for $5 weren't bad at all! We shared the nachos which also were great. The service was good! It wasn't bad but not outstanding!\n",
      "We were a group of 5 people and waited for an outside table on a beautiful night. We were told it would be a 15 minute wait  but it ended up being a half hour or longer wait.  Once we were finally seated  things didn't improve. The outside tables were placed very close together  so you're constantly hitting the person behind you. In addition  the chairs were very uncomfortable. We ordered food and drinks  and while the drinks arrived fairly quickly  we waited about 45 minutes for food. Considering none of us ordered entrees  that seems unreasonably long.  One of the things we ordered was the pretzel with beer cheese  and it was absolutely horrendous. The pretzel was a frozen thing that they didn't bother to heat the whole way through before serving it. The beer cheese dip was 90% beer with a little cheese  just gross. The mac and cheese was a little above Kraft quality.  Based on long wait for such poor quality food  we will not be returning to this place.\n",
      "Was super excited to check out their coffee beer brunch this weekend with my boyfriend. The tap list was great although maybe just a smidge pricey ($16 flights?). It's a special event so whatever. The place was packed and loud. Our waiter came over to take our drink order and it was a good thing we didn't have any questions because we literally had to point to which beer we wanted so that he could copy out every letter of the brewery and name of each beer. We put in our food order shortly after  got our drinks and proceeded to....wait. And wait. And wait. It took at least 35 minutes for our food to come out. And I didn't see anything else coming out of the kitchen either. I wouldn't even have minded so much if maybe someone had spoken to us at all or even acknowledged we'd been waiting when we finally did get our food. Again  they were obviously pretty busy  but a \\so sorry the kitchen is backed up your food will be out shortly\\\" would have gone a long way. Once we finally did get our dishes  I was underwhelmed. I had the southern benedict and somehow the pork and sausage gravy were just entirely bland. The dish had a lot of potential  but just did not measure up. To their credit  the eggs were perfectly poached. My boyfriend had the French toast burger cooked medium and there was no pink to be found in that burger. It was a fun brunch concept though. I wouldn't be in a hurry to head back  but I wouldn't rule it out if something on the tap list intrigued me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Not busy at all for a Saturday night  easily got a table. Started off with the Maine Stout beer  which was good but really didn't hold a candle to other Maine craft breweries. Calamari was safe  crispy  tasty  but the an unexpectedly small portion. For the entrée  I had the farmhouse burger which contained a dollop of goat cheese and a side of aioli. The sauce was very acidic and too thin. The burger  while cooked appropriately  had grill marks that were burnt and emitted a excessively charred flavor. Service was fine  but I probably won't come back here again.  Note that on Saturday there is a bottomless mimosa/bloody mary promotion from 10-3 at 25 bucks / person. Maybe something to check out?\n",
      "I am reviewing based on the three times I have popped into Bainbridge Street Barrel House. I'm going to come back to possibly add that fifth star after I have the opportiunity to stay for a full meal.  Four stars is based on the amazing beer selection  superb competency in bar staff and really tasty snacks I've eaten.     So far I have to say to those who are not a fan of their fries  there is something very wrong with you. (yeah  I'm not making any friends on that comment huh?) Well I stand by that statement. The fries I had here were so crispy  golden  and seasoned perfectly. Maybe you just waited too long to eat them. I asked for some hot sauce (because I'm that person..).and the house made hot sauce I tried was AMAZING. I was so floored by how the flavor profile built with the heat. If you like hot sauces definitely try this one. You'll want to take some home.   Next I can speak to the deliciousness of the pickled butternut squash. So.Damn.Good. I want to eat them every day.   Perhaps a restaurant that has barely been open a month could be given a few more chances to wow you. Perfecting a staff and getting your groove together takes time.  Harsh critics always seem to be the people with the least understanding of the industry. It's important to support local business and this is a solid go-to in the making for sure.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite places to go for drinks and dinner in the city. Margaritas are a must here and they've always got new flavors. Fish tacos  mole meatball steamed buns  and scrapple guac are my favorite!\n",
      "Stop searching  you have found your new favorite place. Moderately priced  delicious food  great portions- even better drinks- don't walk  run to Sancho Pistolas. I felt the food was more surf inspired mex- but I'm not complaining...in fact what I am doing is drooling thinking about my dinner from last night. Get there quick while you can still enjoy the outdoor seating but if not- not worries the inside is cozy with the bar as the focal point. Seriously considered not writing a review to keep this my own little place  but realized I only found it because of Yelp... Pro tip- the entrance is on the side not off the main drag :-) and when you're done head to garage if you're 25-30 or Johnny Brenda's if you wish you were. Buen provencho!\n",

      "Came here before a show nearby at Punchline Philly.   They have some fantastic beers on tap and a handful of outstanding cocktails. Now  I'm not usually a cocktail guy but I trusted Bartender Billy  so I ordered the BurroGordo (fat donkey for you gringos). It was really good and refreshing.   I ordered the steamed bun with pork and it rivals the chicken biscuit at Percy St  for the best food I've ever eaten at a bar.   I had to have a taco as well  so I went with the Korean rib one. Damn it was good. I'm pretty sure I was given extra napkins to catch my tears  because I guarantee you no food particles were wasted.   Overall a great place that rivals any of the amazing food spots in the area. NoLibs/Fishtown has my heart and (most importantly  my stomach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jose's sister place in north philly. Very different vibe then center city but still cool. The bar here takes over the whole space  grab a seat at it and order up some of the best tacos in town.\n",
      "Decided to get dinner here Saturday night. At first we were a bit worried cause we walked in around 8:30 and it seemed really crowded  but we waited around and were able to steal some seats at the bar pretty quickly.   Glad we sat at the bar because Billy  our bartender  was everything you could want in a bartender/server. He was friendly  offered us a taste of some special spicy tequila  and his recommendations for food were completely on par. Also  his margaritas were awesome. I always know I am gonna like a place where they squeeze fresh lime for the marg right in front of you.  Per Billy's recommendation  we ordered the Oyster Po' Boy tacos and the Carnita Steamed Buns. Both were amazing. I didn't know exactly what a steamed bun was and now I know it is a tasty treat. I don't usually like oysters and the fried oysters in the tacos were really good.  Since the food was so good we also ordered the spicy tuna guacamole. The bf loved it  the tuna was a little too spicy for me but still tasty. All of the food came out really fast even though it was relatively crowded. It was a little pricey  but worth it.  I also enjoyed the atmosphere here. They were playing really fun music and there are multiple TVs  which is a bit rare for the neighborhood. We definitely decided that Sancho Pistola's is going to be a new go-to spot for us.\n",
      "Very disappointing food- full of oil  low on flavor  small on quantity. There were nice bartenders! But overall this was a miserable value and we regretted the choice made on a whim. Typical bar atmosphere  so it isn't held against them that there was no room for moving our elbows to eat and people reached past our faces as we tried to enjoy the meal- mostly  two stars just reflects the quality of their \\tacos\\\". Other plates looked better  perhaps.\"\n",
      "This place is straight up awesome!!! Probably my favorite place to go in Fishtown. It's a great chill spot to hang out & a great spot to go to and watch a big game. The good is great  my personal favs being the nacho's  the tortilla soup  and the pork belly taco's. When they have specialty Margarita's flowing  the spicy mango margarita is to die for. All the bartender's and workers are suuuuper friendly and accommodating. One small caveat is the parking  it's obsolete on a busy night or weekend. If you can take the El in  I would recommend doing so  because the lots that are around this place are very quick to tow.\n",
      "Takes forever if you order a sandwich. I like supporting small businesses  but they have to speed things up. Everyone was waiting so long and one of the young girl workers was just standing there on her phone the entire time.\n",
      "Delicious  fresh baked items you can't help but want one of each! Small bake shop with wonderful breakfast sandwiches  friendly staff and amazing baked goods. What more could you ask for?!\n",
      "Babka. Chocolatey  rich babka.   What more do I need to say?  Oh  great coffee  too. And really nice people taking care of you.   Small  almost no seating. Who cares. Worth the trip.\n",
      "Delicious baked goods and helpful staff make this a place I have returned to again and again. They have some unusual creations at The Bakeshop  like the trifecta bar which is chocolate chip cookie  brownie  and chocolate rice crispy bar and it is tremendous. Like really huge. It took me a few days to finish! The store is located right around Rittenhouse so it's in a great neighborhood  it's a very pretty walk if you take your yummies on the go. My only complaint is that the prices are rather high. I suppose that has to do with the the ingredients they use though. Also if you don't can't eat eggs the only options for you are the scones. Overall I would definitely recommend this place but be prepared to pay a little extra.\n",
      "Happy Birthday  (three years old  tomorrow) lovely Bakeshop! You bring a flock of delicious eats and drinks to the neighborhood   a warm welcome  and the cutest sidewalk seating for we lucky few:-)\n",
      "Google \\what dreams are made of\\\" and you will find the Bakeshop on 20th. A tiny little bakery and coffee shop that churns out food that is big on flavor in a major way. Frankly its a sin as to how good their food is  which is ironic since I am pretty sure they serve their sticky buns and bacon  egg  and cheese sandwiches in heaven.   There is always a line  but the folks that work there do the best they can to keep up with the demand. There are items for both the sweet tooth and the savory minded  all that could be the item that they are famous for  but there is room for it all. Prices are a little steep but that is to expect when you visit a delicious bakery in the center of a city that makes things fresh with top ingredients.   Do yourself a favor and get yourself there ASAP. You won't be sorry!!\"\n",

      "Amazing! We stopped here based on the yelp reviews and left with a few cookies  scones and breakfast sandwiches. Everything was fantastic!   My favorite was a chocolate chip cookie that was made with tahini and sesame seeds.\n",
      "I arrived on a Friday around 2:45 to sadly discover that they had already sold out of the brookies...damn! I was prepping for a dinner party and had to go with an assortment of cookies and it was down to slim pickings. I ordered several chocolate chip  oatmeal raisin  and sugar cookies for the party and I couldn't resist grabbing the last vegan lemon poppy seed scone  I love anything lemon poppy seed.  I was a little concerned if the cookies would hold their taste for another day and to my surprise  they did! The cookies were fantastic and a huge hit with my dinner guests! Just the right amount of soft and chewy you expect from a fresh baked cookie. I will have to say that due to their richness  you only need one cookie.  I can't leave without giving props to the lemon poppy seed scone.....YUM-MY!\n",
      "West Philly's one and only ramen joint.  The Good: We were seated right away. Ramen Bar's ambiance is clean and modern  unlike most of its West Philly neighbors. Takoyaki is a great way to start out the meal -- soft  crispy  chewy octopus balls. Thumbs up for the Tonkatsu pork belly slices as well! Juicy and flavorful  it left me wanting more. Food presentation was excellent for all dishes  definitely #instagram worthy. Service is quick and the staff was friendly and accommodating.  The Bad: Noodles tasted like dried instant ramen. A major flaw! The ramen broth  while savory and tasty  had a particularly thick texture  as if extra oil or pork fat had been added to it. I decided not to finish it. Deep fried panko-breaded avocado with tuna was perfectly crispy on the outside and deliciously soft underneath. But the inside was filled with imitation crab meat -- I think they might've forgotten the tuna part?  Ramen Bar faces some competition from Nom Nom down the street. I have to give Nom Nom the edge for their tasty noodles  but Ramen Bar's broth is more savory.\n",
      "Came here with friends for an early Sunday lunch. Service was quick and efficient- we we're seated promptly and food came out quickly. We started with appetizers: Ika geso kara-age (fried squid tentacles) and the takoyaki (fried octopus balls). Both were fried and seasoned well. For our entrees we got ramen and a Donburi Bowl. The green curry ramen was mildly spicy with tender chicken. The toppings all worked very well together  the sour pickled elements contrasted well with the spicier broth. The Chasu-Don bowl was delicious. The pork belly was cooked perfectly. We got a vanilla fried ice cream for dessert  which was a sweet finish to a good meal. This was definitely a meal and experience I'd like to have a again.\n",

      "Decent food  decent price. I can get down with this place. ESPECIALLY now that they have chicken options! It helps that they're only five blocks from me.\n",
      "Wonderful place to go to on a cold day. I usually get the miso ramen with a marinated boiled egg because it's so good. I also enjoyed the takoyaki (fried balls with octopus).  This place is usually pretty crowded at the peak hour  expect a 15 minute wait if it's full (unless you choose to eat at the bar). However  it doesn't take long to get your order.\n",
      "\n",
      "I come here pretty often with friends to eat ramen and service/food is usually pretty average. However  this last experience I had here was pretty much less than mediocre.   We (party of two) came here to eat dinner on saturday night and got seated right away. We decided what to get pretty quickly but it took us a while find a waiter to place our order. I got the miso ramen and my boyfriend got the tonkotsu ramen. We also got pork buns  takoyaki  and a kani salad. I recommend the takoyaki if you're looking for an appetizer  although it is doughy.   Don't get the pork buns. We got the thinnest piece of meat between the buns and all we tasted was the bun tbh lol. It was thinner than the pork in our ramen. Plus we found a small piece of plastic in one of the pork buns while eating...lol.  Get your pork buns elsewhere. Not here.   Overall: Average ramen. Below average service.  Pretty okay appetizers.\n",
      "This is a nice place to grab lunch. The service was really friendly and the food came out quick  but for its price  the quality of the food is just mediocre. It wasn't bad  but it wasn't great. The pork that came in my soup was tough and a little hard to eat. I would come here again if I had a ramen craving  but it was just average.\n",
      "My favorite trendy ramen spot. Is very comfortable atmosphere and friendly staff! The shoyu ramen broth was overall good.)))\n",

      "I had a good visit.  Great spring day and the front was competely opened.  Stopped by for an afternoon snack.  Sat at the bar and ordered a Stella and the Salmon Terrines.  Pleasant staff and cool atmosphere.  The presentation was excellent served over a cucumber salad.  Terrines had a nice tecture and the salmon was fresh.  Would definately stop by on my next visit to Philly.\n",
      "While the french windows and tiny tables give the ambiance of being in Paris (?)  the service was super slow and I was starving by the time my food arrived. How long does it take to make french fries and scoop soup du jour into a bowl? The food is good but I do think it's over priced. The waiters were nice but super slow.\n",
      "I feel like I need to leave a review  because I have been disappointed to see Caribou cafe losing stars... I have eaten here many times and it's always good. The experience I am giving 5 stars for was dinner last week. I brought a group of 7 for dinner and everything was spot on: the service was outstanding  the food was excellent (despite what another yelper said about the french onion soup  in my opinion it is always delicious). Our food was wonderful and everyone got their dishes at the same time. And everything was hot and fresh. In addition to the good service and good food  we all had wine and cocktails and an appetizer charcuterie plate and the whole bill was less than $300. That is quite a deal for a delicious meal in a cute bistro in center city for a somewhat large party. Good job caribou cafe!\n",

      "Caribou Cafe is one of my regular haunts during the spring and summer months.  I almost hate to write about it for fear the the porch would get more crowded than it already does on Friday nights.  It's got a nice open atmosphere  (mostly) friendly wait staff  good French food  live entertainment on weekends and a descent wine list.  Oh  and me on a fair number of Friday nights.  They have a descent beer list - to include one of my favorite summer bottled swills... Lancaster Strawberry Wheat.  But normally I set up with the wine and Pellegrino.  I don't see it on their menu - but there is a halfway descent Malbec there - and I favor their house Pino.    The wait staff will say their Skate Wing is their signature dish - but to be honest I'm not a fan.  Skate should be light - and theirs is smothered in an over-heavy sauce.  I also hate their bread.  Other than that  though  it is hard to go wrong.    If you sit down at a table ask for the bar menu in addition to the lunch or dinner menu or you'll miss out on half teh selections - including the Fromages du Jour (which I assume means cheeses on a plate) and the glory of honey soaked nuts and cheese.  They have a good burger... and the Croque-Monsieur makes for a slammin' lunch.  But I think the star on the menu is usually in the specials - which right now includes a salmon dish that made heads turn as people walked past.\n",
      "What a find!  And right next to the Forrest Theater.  We were lured in by the Chimay sign  but we stayed because of the Lillet.  If neither of those are familiar to you  do a little homework or just pop in and sample.    We had several cocktails and a platter of meats and cheeses  all delicious.  If I go back  though  I will order a Vesper.  SO nice to be in a bar that can actually make legit cocktails.  Just writing thus review is making my mouth water!\n",
      "3 for food  4 for wine.  Go here to have a lovely  cozy drink with a friend  not to eat your favorite meal.  The food lacks presentation  and you can simply just do better elsewhere.  The atmosphere  however  is perfect to unwind with a friend after a long work day  or head to to warm up on a cold day.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a wonderful waitress  Katie.  It was her first day at Caribou Cafe  but she was a seasoned and excellent waitress (she checked on us regularly to see how we were doing).  There were two of us in our party.  I ordered off of the fixed price menu  and I was not disappointed.  For $28 I received the endive and arugula salad (the portion was huge)  the mussels in curry (OMG -- excellent and a large serving) that was also served with french fries  and the dessert of the day  which turned out to be expresso creme brule.  I expected the dessert to be warm  but when it was served to me cold I was not disappointed.  My  husband ordered 2 of the specials of the day: (1) the endive and arugula salad with salmon and a special lemon dressing  and (2) the 10 ounce sirloin (MR) with crab.   The steak was full of gristle  and when the waitress asked us how our meal was he commented on the gristle and toughness of the steak.  She replied that she would share this comment with the chef and management.  She returned a few minutes later to say that  the staff wanted to provide him with a complimentary dessert for his troubles disappointment.  He ordered the chocolate mousse  and he was not disappointed.  We also ordered a bottle of Malbec Reserve  and it is a wine we will order again. We look forward to our next visit.\n",
      "Loved the food! Tried escargot and frog legs for the first time! I will be back next time I'm in town! Yummy! We sat upstairs  great privacy and service.\n",
      "My favorite happy hour spot. Discovered how amazing all the appetizers are back in summer 2011 center city sips (great time to check out all the different center city happy hour spots). The mac & cheese is great!  They have a great selection of beers on tap and bottles. The food is superb! If you're looking for a private party space  they have a cozy basement space with a personal bar. Only thing is occasionally you'll have some crashers who want to use the ATM and restroom (even though there is one on the second floor and 2 on the 3rd)  Just go! You won't be disappointed\n",
      "\n",
      "I held my husband's surprise birthday party for about 35 people in the basement bar at Black Sheep. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. From the first call I placed to inquire about hosting the party and spoke with James  the owner  to the night of the party where Adam  our bartender  made sure all went smoothly  everyone I dealt with was fantastic. Overall  a great experience.\n",
      "Hello James   I'll stop to eat next trip to Philadelphia - you make it sound welcoming!  Thanks for responding.\n",
      "3 bars on 3 different levels means there's always place to spread out. Different bars on tap and usually friendly waitstaff. The perfect neighborhood bar. Grab a beer here while you wait for your table at Monk's!\n",
      "\n",
      "Black Sheep is a cool place if you like dark bars.  (Which you know I do!)  I have had dinner here and it's good for basics (burgers chicken fingers.)  It can get pretty crowded since it's not huge  but try the downstairs bar if the main room is packed.\n",
      "This is a small  cozy bar  with  I think  three floors.  I've been here four times  and each time has been a good experience.  The mac n' cheese is amazing.  It's very close to going on that list of foods that I'd want at my last meal.  I had the bangers n' mash the last time I was there  and was extremely happy with them.  The pork sausages were perfectly cooked  and packed with deliciousness.  Service is good  and the only reason I dinged them a star is that their beer selection is really  really small.  They're not putting on airs about being a world class beer bar  but frankly  they're just lacking in this department.  They've got Guinness  and a couple other good beers  but six or seven beers doesn't really cut it  anymore.  Bump up the draught beer list  or get a decent bottle selection  and then I'll bump you guys back up to four stars.\n",
      "Went here last night for the first time.  Service was crazy slow  and to quote-up Zanna \\it took a year and a day to get\\\" our food.  I guess we were supposed to \\\"understand\\\" that our server was also the bartender and we were suppose to \\\"know\\\" that because of this service was going to be devastating slow.  But seriously  are you serious?    Anyways  the server finally came over and she was like  frazzled and all and asked for us to give our order.  We said 'em  she didn't write 'em down  20 (!!!) minutes later another server came to ask what we had ordered just to \\\"go over our order again.\\\"  Is my review just like Zanna's?  Sorry.     Anyways  food FINALLY CAME OUT.  I was famished.  I was stoked to see that Fish and Chips was a very nice plate of fish and chips.  The fish was a massive fillet that was nice and crisp but not too flavorful (yay for malt vinegar) and the chips were very well seasoned.  Great for $11.  The BF got gazpacho and it was nice and flavorful as well.  I don't like gazpach that much  but his was yummy.  I don't like cold soups.  Ew.   Anyways  I might be back to explore the other floors.  SERVICE was horrible.  We left her a \\\"You've Been Yelped\\\" card.\"\n",
      "Despite a recent renovation  the Black Sheep is dingy and dirty and the sloppiest  most unattractive hostess (that is until I saw our waitress) sat us at our table upstairs. Although it was 10 pm on a Wednesday night  she was hesitant about sitting a party of two at a large table. Perhaps she was expecting a sudden stream of late night diners. The waitress was as sloppy and disheveled as the hostess. No makeup  no hairstyle and clothes that looked as though she found them on the street. I ordered something from the menu that did not have goat cheese listed as one of its ingredients  but she argued with me that the menu did have it listed. I showed her the menu and corrected her. She was rude and had a nasty attitude. I guess I would too if I looked like her. It was $30 for a burger  a salad and two Diet Cokes.The staff is arrogant  the place is filthy and the food is perfect for those who don't care about their health or appearance and like to stuff their faces with a bunch of high fat  high cholesterol  high calorie greasy food. No thanks.\n",
      "This place was really cool  we walked up upstairs and sat at the bar. We just went for the beer so we got 5 tasters  which was all of their beer. She have us wine glasses of each one  it was nice. The bartender was really nice and made you feel comfortable. I'm sorry I don't know how much we paid for the tasters but my boyfriend was happy when we walked out so give it a try. I liked 3 5 beers that we tasted  I like less hoppy so there's a chance the other 2 were just too hoppy for me. I'm not sure if I'll find myself in this area again but if I do  I'd go back.\n",
      "What the heck is with the attitude of some of the barstaff here?  I know it sucks being a server and I know hipsters are probably the most annoying people on the face of the universe  especially if they're beer snobs  but holy jesus  can you at least smile and act as if your customers aren't bothering you?    Food is really good  and the drinks are inexpensive.   I recommend getting a table rather than sitting at the bar lest you be served by some sour face uber bitch.    They've also got Irish John quizzo on Sundays which always makes for a fun time.\n",
      "Went for a quiet happy hour on monday and had quite a nice time. The female bartender was really cool and kept our glasses full. They brew their own beer and I felt they were hit or miss  nothing really stood out to me.  4 dollar fried Mac and cheese balls were also a nice happy hour addition.  Decor needs to be updated as well as their dart boards.  All in all I would go back again.\n",
      "For me the layout of the bar did not work.  Was seated in the back near a dark exit (to the  kitchen?).  The food and the beer were OK  and it did not have that extra edge needed to get into the four star range in my book.\n",
      "Stopped in for brunch and a beer on Sunday. Sat at the bar  bartender was friendly  and quick with the fresh pints. On cask was a boring  flavorless amber (depressing... beer engines deserve better)  but the hop harvest ale was a solid  citrusy pleasure. To go with my liquid brunch  I selected the steak and eggs. Steak came out overdone  but not to the point where I felt compelled to complain. It was still acceptable. Eggs were good  nicely poached. Menu indicated there would be oven roasted potatoes  but instead I got three little potato pancakes. No problem  they were fine  but this discrepancy went unmentioned.  Food was ok  beers ranged from pretty decent to fizzy water with the barest hint of malt. Wasn't even close to being blown away by anything  and was actually kind of pissed at a blurb on the beer menu. Something like (paraphrasing)  \\If you don't like your beer it isn't because we didn't brew it right  it's because you're stupid. No refunds.\\\" I guess I could understand if they had a huge number of townies sending back hoppy pale ales because they were expecting something like a Yuengling  but it's still annoying for a company to take the attitude that they are incapable of making mistakes. If I order an IPA and it tastes like butterscotch met hops  your beer is infected and I damn well better get a refund. It wouldn't be the first time I encountered a beer in a brewery that had gone south.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I really want to like this place  but both times that I was there left a bad taste in my mouth (this past Saturday  quite literally).  Having a brewery right in Center City seems ideal  but Nodding Head is anything but.  I stopped in here on a Wednesday evening for a drink and despite having hardly any customers the service was at a snail's pace. This would have been somewhat acceptable had the bartender been at least a little interested in being there  as opposed to him being dismissive and aloof.   Never wanting to simply judge an establishment after a single visit  my friends and I ventured here again on Saturday night (26 January) and just like my previous experience  the service was atrocious. However  that wasn't all  we were given a menu with only three available beers (one of them no longer being served) and the beer that I did order  a stout of some sort  was warm and a bit rancid. At least I got what I ordered  the server completely screwed up my friend's drink  bringing him back something completely different than what he asked for. Granted  this was after waiting five minutes to be acknowledged and then another ten minutes for the drinks to arrive (it was not crowded when we were there).  After finishing our incorrect and horribly tasting drinks  we couldn't find our server to pay the tab  so we just left money on the table and got the hell out of there. Needless to say  while the novelty of having a brewery in Center City is obviously appealing  both the service and the actual product at Nodding Head are pretty terrible and I wouldn't recommend anyone going there for anything.\n",
      "So  I'm in between on a 3 vs. 4 stars. I was there for a happy hour last night. The service  the drinks  and the food was good. We got a bunch of apps  since there was a large group. The potato pancakes and the mussels were probably my favs. I'd def go back...\n",
      "A short beer list and the quality was average. I expected a wide range of selections  but many were of similar flavor and taste. Maybe it was the time of year  but I had hoped for more from a brewery!  In general  the prices were reasonable. The food was delish for what I ordered (a French dip sandwich) and the portion was perfect (not too much but not too little). The french fry dipping sauce was awesome  but the waiter was not willing to let me in on the secret ingredients. Nevertheless it was a great meal! I enjoyed the night overall. The ambiance is college-age and young professionals  so I didn't feel too out of place. The restaurant is dark  though  and can get quite loud. Not a place to go if you're looking for an intimate setting to talk.\n",
      "Stopped here briefly during a bar crawl. If you're not someone who is into craft beers and trying new things  then Nodding Head probably isn't for you. It's awesome to see a place hand you a list of six options to pick from. They can do that considering they brew their own stuff in-house. They had a German day this past Saturday as well as a couple incarnations from Iron Hill locations in the area. The in-house version  was tasty. A look at the bobble head case is obviously a must. If you think you have one that might interest the owner  ask for Gordon. He'll trade you some beer for one if it's good enough. Also got a little tour of their mini-brewery. It was awesome.\n",
      "Popped into Reading Terminal and decided to graze.   This is just a review for quick service and not the full monty.   Molly's was one of the stops as I was in the mood for some crispy fried potato-ey goodness.  It was a tossup between their house made chips or French fries - I chose the latter.   Small counter off to the side for togo orders makes it quick and easy to get your eats on.  When offered  I opted for the small size.   Fries arrived after a few short minutes  fresh from the fryer. The menu said \\garlic aioli\\\" but there was no side of such and if the taters were tossed in it  I couldn't taste it.  While they did have a good flavor  I thought they could have been been done a tad longer.   Portion size was great. Staff was very friendly.  Good value however at sub-$4.   While I was eating  I looked at a few of the plates around the restaurant and noticed some good-looking plates (cheesesteak and some burgers/sandwiches).  Lots of beer available and they sell growlers. Would definitely come back as it looked to be a pretty good spot.\"\n",

      "Family was in Philadelphia for the Army-Navy Game. On Sunday we stayed in the downtown area just around the corner from the Reading Market. (One of my favorite places to visit in the city.)  We stopped in for a couple of beers and ended staying for many beers.  Our waitress Natasha was excellent. This seems to be a very popular place the Eagles were on TV and lots of folks stopped for a beers and to watch the game.  They have a very good selection of beers and wines. Although we did not dine with them the food looked excellent.  This place I located in the Reading Market - has a nice eating area. We stopped back for breakfast the next morning but missed breakfast (believe they stop serving breakfast around 11 am??)   Be sure to visit these folks when at the Market!\n",
      "If you're in Philly  you have to check out Reading Terminal Market. The market itself can be overwhelming with options. This spot is a nice choice if you want to guarantee a seat in a comfortable setting - especially if you're looking to grab a drink at the bar.\n",
      "Lunch in Philadelphia during the business week is a common occurrence for some but a real luxury to us suburban workers.  I've taken off from work before just to attend lunch events in Philly so I'm rather sure of my conviction.  I was fortunate enough to work from home one day  get my yearly physical and finally get to try Molly Malloy's.  I met up with fellow Yelper Rebecca S. to try the highly publicized grilled cheese.  Being that I was on no real schedule  I had time to linger and enjoy all that this establishment really had to offer.  The space is open and approachable.  I never did get to go in the beer garden but I remember it looking a bit dank and dark.  Not the case with Molly's.  Sure there isn't a ton of natural light at that spot of the market but they've done a nice job on decor.  We chose a high-top in the back.  We ordered the braised ox-tail and the grilled cheese.  The ox-tail was soft and shredded  perfectly cooked and basically was eaten as an open face sandwich.  The grilled cheese was serious.  Goat cheese  spinach  caramelized onions and some kind of funky jam.  You can be sure that I'm going to attempt to replicate it at home.  The fries were a little hit or miss.  Some were great and crispy and others were a touch under-cooked.  Maybe it's because they're hand-cut so they have different cooking times.  Regardless  still pretty good.  I don't have the chance to get here during the week but it wasn't just novelty that made me enjoy this meal.  The food  service and prices were excellent.  Now I just need a center city job....\n",
      "Had the Philly cheese   it had good flavor and was a good size for lunch. My only complaint is that they gave way too many fries. Service was good.\n",
      "This was my second time eating here was very disappointed! !!! Eggs oily and home fries pretty awful.  they also gave me wrong  toast I wanted whole wheat. I didn't want to say anything to the waitress I think she was too busy making herself look good  I will never eat here again.  I'd rather eat at dutch landing. wasn't worth the second trip.\n",
      "Great in both quantity and quality! Molly Malloy's is situated in the corner of Reading Terminal Market  there's a sit-down portion as well as a take-out portion. The line can get rather long  but they move at a decent pace. There was more than enough food for me to take home leftovers.\n",
      "Fantastic brunch last weekend. Love the drink menu and house wine selection of \\Good\\\" \\\"Better\\\" and \\\"Best\\\".  We ordered a ton of food and it was all fantastic. The octopus  beef tartare  croque madame were all amazing.\"\n",
      "This place is perfect.   The food  the cocktails  the service  the ambiance...everything.   Came here on a whim with a friend visiting from out of town.   We couldn't stop talking about the place after we left.   They pride themselves on classic cocktails (as they should).  I will definitely be going back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great drinks  tasty food  comfy ambience  nice staff. Sat at the bar. Ordered the whole trout and my fiancé had the burger. Very good. I had the french 75 and he had the Gimlet. The restaurant itself was very cozy and chic. Had a lovely time!\n",
      "This place has the BEST cheese board I've ever had. The cheeses are great  obviously  but the cheese board shines because of the accompaniments. The board comes with bread  fruit  honey  and some kind of sweet nutty spread. It is a perfect meal  giving you some salty and sweet and stinky. It's excellent.   The other food here is also great. They have specials everyday and they always are changing. The wine list is excellent. Service is decent. Nothing special.   I had an amazing creme brûlée once here  too. I wish it was permanently available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wonderful little French joint. Service was wonderful. Food was great. A tartine lagged a bit from the ham  but the bread itself was very good. Duck confit was very crispy and balanced the texture just right.\n",
      "I really wanted to like The Good King. French dishes  reasonable prices  good selections of wine and beer  and proximity to my home all looked great on paper. Unfortunately  the reality was less appealing. Compared to Chick's  which previously occupied this space  the ambience is brighter and more convivial. The booths are cosy  compared to open tables  and the communal table looks to be a good idea. The \\background\\\" music is loud  but it was possible for my spouse and me to carry on a conversation without shouting. The choice of music shows this restaurant to be a little less musically-challenged than most others in Philadelphia.  There were a few French songs  which fits the menu  and they did mix it up a bit. However  too many 60s and 70s pop tunes  Motown  and Funk  etc. Given the image that I thought they are trying to project  it could have been done better.  Our waitperson started out very friendly. When we asked for no ice in our tap water  that's what she brought us. We ordered escargot  brussesl sprouts  tuna tartar  and moules frites  intending to share all the dishes. My partner ordered a glass of wine and I had a beer. The wine came in a small glass  and while the amount was fine  they should go the extra mile and use larger crystal glasses  which still can be had cheaply  but give a much nicer experience. The wine was good quality for the price  and the beer  which I hadn't tasted before  was very good. The escargot tasted fine  although they were served shelled. I've had escargot several times  in France (but seldom in the US) and they were always served in the shell. The brussels sprouts were disappointing. I guess we were hoping for the crispy type of preparation that is served at Valanni  but the Kings' sprouts were soft and doused with a very garlicky sauce. The sprouts themselves had little taste. The tuna tartar  was served chopped up in a mayonnaise-type sauce (aioli?). I didn't mind it  but my partner was turned-off after the first bite. the mussels and fries were served in the same bowl  swimming in a spicy tomato sauce. The sauce was actually pretty good  but I don't think that I've had moules frites before with the mussels and fries in the same bowl  soaking in the same sauce  and I didn't particularly like this presentation. The dish was also described as containing sausage  and there were a few tiny fragments of meat that were tasty  but most notable for their scarcity. The mussels themselves were OK.  Our waitperson came over shortly after the escargot and brussels sprouts had been set down on the table  and asked how the food was. My partner replied that she hadn't had a chance to taste anything. I wonder if our server took this comment amiss  because I thought that her manner cooled a bit after that. I find that waitstaff in most Philadelphia restaurants are intrusive  asking if everything is OK  when you haven't even had a bite  of food  or worse  when your mouth is full with the first bite.   So  our waitperson at The Good King  rather than being outside the norm  was a reminder of how bad the norm has become.  Due to the ambience  the good beer  the reasonable prices  and proximity to home  I may go back for drinks and a burger.  However  I don't think that my spouse would join me.\"\n",
      "Just went to this place for the first time the other day. Overall  the food was good. I shared the chick peas  Brussels sprouts  and steak tartare with a friend as a snack.  The steak tartare was really good. The baguette that came with it could have been slightly thinner as they were almost overwhelming crunchy. The Brussels sprout yogurt sauce was great  as were the Brussels sprouts. Boarder line too salty.  The chick peas tasted good but were so dry.  Great environment  I'll be back\n",
      "\n",
      "3.5 stars  It was good but didn't blow me out of the water. Portions are huge  food is tasty but service was pretty slow - and this was during an early Saturday dinner when we were one of three tables. Recommend the Po Tek (super flavorful seafood soup for 2).\n",
      "A wonderful late lunch at Chabaa.   We had the Fried Dumplings  Shrimp Pad Thai  and Green Curry. Everything was delicious.   I wish the Fried Dumplings were pan fried/seared  but they were deep fried like perogies instead. They were still good  just not the traditional way (to me) of eating dumplings.  As someone who has an open stomach and eats pretty much everything  I have never been a fan of curry. My wife ordered and I tried some. I ended up loving it. That should tell you everything you need to know.   Shrimp Pad Thai was pretty standard and met every expectation.   Fried Dumplings - 3/5 Shrimp Pad Thai - 5/5 Green Curry - 5/5  We also had the place to ourselves due to sneaking into the restaurant despite it being closed (long story short..they kept the place open due to a big reservation but the reservation never showed). The server was perfect by every measure.\n",
      "I am writing this review after having had a delicious dinner tonight at Chabaa consisting of 2 appetizers: 1) Fresh Spring Rolls  and 2) Bangkok style street pork  as appetizers and for Entrees we had: 1) Crepe Pad Thai  and 2) Crispy Duck Pad Thai.  We brought 2 bottles of vino with us (thanks Jenn M. for the BYOB heads-up) and had a fabulous time!  I love this place for the authentic Thai food in Philly!  It was about $70 for 2 for food and corking fees.  Go there if you can't get to Bangkok tonight!  Cheers!\n",
      "Really heavy red curry. The spring rolls and pad thai tasted pre-prepared. The food  generally  tasted not very fresh. Spring roll was soaked in oil and pad thai had a weird smokey flavor.  To too it all  this place is much pricier than other (better) thai places in the city. Would not recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered a seafood padthai and a regular padthai but the waitress brought out seafood padthai and a curry. So we had to wait for them to make a regular padthai and my seafood padthai became cold as a result. Ofc we did not have a good experience so we decided to come back and give another try. With both times eating here  the flavor was just okay and service was slow. This place is pricey because of the location and is overrated!\n",
      "Great BYO  but a bit expensive to go here regularly.  Correct me if I'm wrong  but the style is Asian street food which I assume a $22 duck pad thai dish wouldn't normally be part of.  I used to get the Panang special ($22) which is fantastic  but I feel like the portion has gotten a lot smaller over the years.  I recently switched to seafood crazy noodles ($19) which is also spectacular.    If it was a little more reasonably priced  my wife would drag me here once a week  but we only go on special occasions.\n",
      "Excellent Thai cuisine. I had the pad Thai and the vegetable tofu ginger basil dish. The latter was better. Pad Thai seemed slightly blander than other excellent ones I have had elsewhere. The chicken peanut appetizer was very flavorful and fresh. Overall  very nice experience and try multiple things on the menu!\n",
      "DAMN THAT WAS GOOD! Had drunken noodles and they were the BEST! Also appreciated the service and the help with how to go about getting wine  which I wanted as soon as I saw everybody else with their byob.\n",
      "The food was good  not great.  The service was good.  Honestly  it wasn't really a memorable meal.  I probably wouldn't return because it was just ok and I can get better Thai food elsewhere.  The coconut ice cream is pretty good.\n",
      "Great coffee  really friendly staff  and it's my favorite place to get some work done.\n",
      "While in the neighborhood  I searched yelp for a good local coffee shop in the area. This place was near the top of the list  so I decided to check it out. My whole party tried something from this shop. My mom tried their iced chai tea latte (she LOVED it)  my boyfriend tried a regular coffee with soy creamer (loved it)  my dad tried a bottle of the organic lemonade they were selling in their refrigerated section (he loved it)  and I tried an iced mocha latte with almond milk. My drink was perfect- not too sweet with just the right ratio of chocolate flavor and coffee. I really enjoyed it. I loved the overall atmosphere of this coffee shop as well  although I'm not sure if it's the best place to get work done or study if you are looking for a quiet environment. My favorite part about this place? The incredible selection of milks they had available for coffee. It's a vegan spot  so no dairy milk is available. However  they have every non-dairy option you can think of including: coconut cream  macadamia milk  oat milk  almond milk  soy creamer  soy milk  etc. Overall  a really adorable spot with great coffee!\n",
      "This place rocks! Everything is vegan and everything is delicious! There are 5 choices of non-dairy creamer for coffee drinks. There are delicious desserts. There are wonderfully filling sandwiches and a rocking salad. Also bagels are nice and reasonably priced. You can't go wrong here. Check out the mini-library in the back  so many intelligent good reads back there. Staff is super friendly without being pretentious or fake.  Favorite!!\n",
      "I really dug this place . Drove in to Philadelphia found this V friendly spot  the staff was great helpful I loved the show flyers in the hall way . I sat down relaxed for a good while  with my coffee & snack w no one bothering . Pretty much loved everything about this spot . We need one in long beach .\n",
      "Love this little neighborhood coffee shop. The atmosphere  the food and the coffee all great! I've been to Grindcore House 2 times when I was visiting Philly. Everything I ordered I was completely pleased with. Love that everything is either vegetarian or vegan.  Will definitely stop there again next time I'm in town.\n",
      "Our continued search for non-dairy (and thus vegan) items took us to Grindcore.  What a great surprise.  Others with more knowledge of the local neighborhood have commented how it is relatively out of place and I would agree but I guess I am part of the \\foreign\\\" crowd that some dislike.  Staff was super friendly and answered our questions as we were first time visitors.  Personally I am not vegan and I do not like the milk substitutes they offer for coffee  but that is what is available and you should know that going in.  Amazing place for vegans and they will do your lattee with soy/almond milk  etc.  Food was pretty tasty and we had a couple bagels with creamcheese.  I recommend adding avocado to the bagel to add some extra creaminess.    Book shelf in the back is very cool as well and has some very interesting reads.  Radical.\"\n",
      "I searched Yelp to find a few spots near my office where I could have lunch.  I went today and truly enjoyed my lunch! I had the Greenwich sandwich - avocado  tomato  lettuce  spinach  hummus and cucumber.  I also had the banana and chocolate chip bread which was moist and tasty!  Next time I'll try the hot drinks.  I'll definitely be a regular.\n",
      "Great vegan options in a unique atmosphere. They have more than just coffee shop fare and sweets  with a complete selection of vegan sandwiches and salads.\n",
      "Good coffee  friendly service  much better than wawa which is the closest coffee option.  Prices are fair  and the vegan cupcake I ate was pretty good.\n",
      "Great vegan option in south Philly. Hipster vibe. Greenwich sandwich is fabulous. Pastries and coffee selection gets A+\n",
      "Very solid all around cheese steak  especially for a place that delivers. I was recently staying at the Embassy Suits in Center City and they delivered there very quickly. It was about 20 degrees outside and really windy so this really hit the spot and I stayed warm.\n",
      "I'm a reg here  we often order delivery and they come pretty quickly. Food is fast and consistent  if you haven't had Del Rossi's.....it's a must try.\n",
      "Quick delivery to our hotel. Awesome cheesesteak  super good hoagie  fresh veggies. Cannoli was also great! Thanks for delivering on this super chilly night!!\n",
      "Went inside and sat down here  not a Philly native. Sandwiches came out quick  waitress and staff were friendly.  Food was good  exactly what we expected. Place was clean  onion rings were super tasty. Would definitely go back.\n",
      "\n",
      "I live right around the corner and saw this place being built for a while  so when i saw it was open  i figured i had to try one of their cheesesteaks.  I was hoping i wouldnt have to drive out to delassandro's or down to john's roast pork anymore  but i was very disappointed with this place.  the roll was great  but the meat was not sliced thin  and it wasnt chopped up like it should be  also the cheese should be mixed with the meat instead of just placed on the roll.  also  places like delassandro's give you plenty of meat  this place  the meat didnt even come close to covering the whole roll.  the decor is nice and its clean  and dont know about  the other food  but there cheesesteaks need tons of improvement.\n",
      "So good!! Pizza was great  cheese fries were awesome  and the workers were nice. An extra plus was that the bathrooms are kept nice and clean!\n",
      "I've ordered from Del Ross's many times and have a number of favorites.  Today I stopped in for a turkey burger.  WOW!!!  This burger was fresh and perfectly seasoned.  You'd expect to find this hand crafted marvel in a home kitchen  not a pizza shop.  I highly recommend.\n",

      "Great Mexican BYOB! I went to Las Cazuelas for the first time for my birthday.  We had a wonderful time.  I was looking for a fun and festive place to go with friends.  This was the perfect choice. We brought our own bottle of tequila  and they made tasty margaritas for the table.  Those were a big hit with my friends  and a cool twist for a Mexican BYOB.  The restaurant is cute.  Plus  the food here is delicious.   I'm surprised this place doesn't have higher reviews on Yelp  because it far exceeded my expectations...   The guacamole appetizer was fresh and yummy.  I ordered the shrimp entree with rice and vegetables  and asked for it spicy.  My entrée had an attractive presentation on the plate (i.e. looked classy)  and was delicious  well seasoned  and very fresh. On my suggestion  my partner ordered one of their mole sauce dishes (i.e. a sauce usually made from unsweetened chocolate and pureed pumpkin seeds)  and it was tasty too.   I should also note that the waitress was very attentive.  When I placed my order  I explained to her that I have mild lactose intolerance and can't eat much butter or cream (but am okay with cheese)  so she had the chef cook the veggies in olive oil  rather than butter.  Thanks for being so cool about accommodating that request!    The prices are extremely reasonable for fancy and unusual Mexican food  and I love the fact they're a BYOB.  The chef serves creative and inspired cuisine  which has a traditional flair and style to it.  In other words: Don't come here for regular tacos or burritos.  Come here for a fun foodie experience at a reasonable price  and bring tequila for the perk of BYOB Margaritas!\n",
      "The food is terrific.  Not just the food -- the presentation.  The arroz con pollo I ordered came to my table artfully arranged on my plate.  And it was delicious  as was every part of my order.  Why the two stars?  As it seems others know all too well  the service was abysmal.  On one occasion  we waited interminably for a table  only to find out that the waiter thought we were part of another party  when there had been two seats available the whole time!    Once we were served  the waitstaff ignored us.  This place seriously needs a management shakeup.  It needs a better manager  and a dedicated hostess/outside manager.\n",
      "I tried Las Cazuelas recently  after hearing pretty good things about the food and atmosphere.  The first day I went in the place was crowded but we were seated promptly and our order was taken right away.  The food came out fast for how many people were there.  However  it lacked any real flavor.  Camarone tacos for me and a seitan dish for my friend.  The seitan was way too salty with no other flavour and the tacos were very bland.  Still hungry  we got the ceviche.  This was the ONLY good thing about our meal.  Water glasses weren't filled at all during the meal  even after the restaurant emptied.  I decided to go back a few days later  to give it another chance.  We had a different server this time  who seemed very new to the business.  Tables who sat after us had their order taken before.  However  again  the food came out fast.  (Wrong order first  but quickly fixed.)  This time I got the veggie enchiladas and my friend got the camarone dish.  Again  VERY disappointed.  Salt and pepper seem to be their only seasonings.  The shrimp had NO flavour  they were very much overcooked.  The sauce on the enchiladas was the same salsa put out on the tables as you are seated.  The veggies on the side of the shrimp meal were the exact same as the ones in the enchiladas.  There is no creativity or thought behind any of these meals.  I will not be going back.  I have had MUCH better Mexican off of the trucks in South Philly.\n",
      "For authentic  fresh and flavorful Mexican food  you have to go to Las Cazuelas. The enchiladas  Mole  and Mole Enchiladas are fantastic. The Horchata and Mexican Coffee are excellent drinks. It gets major points for being BYOB. The meats are so tender and the rice is perfectly cooked. The main reason for the perfect five stars is what topped the whole experience for me: the dessert. THE BEST DESSERT I'VE EVER EATEN. EVER. You MUST order the Cheesecake Bunuelos!!! It will blow your mind. I will forever be returning to Las Cazuelas.\n",
      "BYO mexican spot in Northern Liberties  Came for brunch and the service was great. Food was delicious. I'm a fan of chorizo and they highlight chorizo a lot in their dishes.  Bring some tequila and order some margarita mix.\n",
      "Great family owned restaurant with fantastic mexican food and BYO (T).  Medium sized restaurant with two separate dining areas  good for large groups as you can reserve the entire back room.  The service is fantastic  even when we've shown up 20 minutes prior to closing time  the wait staff was still incredibly hospitable.  The margaritas they mix are great  which is saying something as I typically don't enjoy margaritas.  The food is delicious  and parking is very easy in the area.  If you find yourself in Northern Liberties  give it a try!  They frequently run specials on Groupon and Living Social  so keep your eyes open and save a few bucks!\n",
      "\n",
      "I used to live a few doors down from Las Cazuelas in 2005 and went there faithfully because the food is DELICIOUS! I dont' know if they still make it  but the Chilean sea bass with pumpkin mole was one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten.  My husband and I visited last Sunday for Brunch and we ordered a TON of food because we had a $50 gift certificate to use up. I can highly reccommend the Huevos Divorciados and the Omlette Poblano. I am a poblano and mushroom lover and the oaxaca cheese melts into the eggs and veggies in the most wonderful way. My husband had the Divorciados and it was both unusual and tasty!  My favorite at Las Cazuelas are the tacos- the steak with fresh onions and cilantro is by far the winner in my book and I confess  I have dreamed of them and often cannot resist the urge to go get a big plate of them! We tried the marinated steak tacos this time and did not like them very much- there was a red coating of marinade on the steak and it was overwhelming. You could not taste the yummy  meat-y  grilled flavor that is so great in the regular steak tacos. My husband loved the shredded pork tacos and I thought they were ok. The shrimp tacos are always a winner and taste fresh  crisp and light. I suppose it is the pure flavors and how they usually treat the fresh ingredients that brings me back time and again  I will veer away from the overly marinated items in the future. As always  the cafe de Olla (coffee with cinnamon +) and desserts are very good. I tell everyone about this place and always bring it up as an option when we have folks in from out of town. Keep up the great work!!\n",
      "I came here for my birthday dinner  and the waitress was very forgetful and basically sucked. We brought a bottle of tequila for margaritas and I am almost certain the waitress stole a nice amount of it  (the bottle was returned with 1 6th left and we only had two pitchers) and the two waitresses were acting drunk when we left. Good food  poor service\n",
      "Mexican food in the city can be a hit or miss and it's hard to find a place that serves the authentic stuff  and his place nailed it!! Went here on a Friday night and brought a bottle of tequila. Unfortunately the free pitcher of margarita mix is only valid Monday through Thursday  but the pitcher wasn't that expensive. The empanadas and fish tacos were to die for. We also got shrimp quesadillas. Service was great! Initially they brought out the wrong type of quesadillas  and gave us the shrimp ones on the house.  The only pitfall of this whole dining experience were the complimentary chips and salsa... They were a bit meh\n",
      "Delish! Came in for breakfast on a Sunday  and got lucky with no wait. Western omelette special was awesome. The reviews are right--the tots are great!\n",
      "Greg's is a nice local spot which made me feel like I was walking in to my local spot in California. Friendly staff and a nice selection of dishes we went for the omelette with taters and toast.   Egg white omelette was fluffy and full of spinach  mushroom  onions and bacon. It was a very good portion as were the tots.  The tots were my favorite part of the meal. Super crispy and wonderfully brown outside shell with a tender and not greasy inside. It is like the Lay's potato chip slogan \\bet ya can't eat just one\\\" and you cannot. Just great!  I had a side of the hash which was a little disappointing as it was just mashed up taters and some chunks of corned beef cubes.  I would skip this one in the future as it's really redundant considering you get any meat you want and tots with your breakfast.  I did like the Cholula Hot Sauce provide as well as Sriracha and Tabasco.  The multi-grain toast was very good and hearty and toasted perfectly.   I will definitely come back next time I am in Manayunk PA.  4 stars\"\n",
      "If tots were considered a real meal  I'd eat a Greg's every day. Greg's is the perfect spot for a no fuss  good old delicious breakfast that you could probably make at home  but tastes so much better because you didn't have to. The waitstaff is nice  there's a good amount of seating  and the food is sure to fill you up!\n",
      "Food is awesome  but the service can be a little awkward.   We've gone about 4-5 times now and I'd have to say that Brekky in a cup is a solid choice. I want to give 4 or 5 stars  but things could definitely run smoother in there. I want to almost just grab things myself if I could. There's nothing worse than seeing the coffee pot that's so close to you and you want a refill...or the first cup. I'd let it slide  but there's always been a hiccup of some sort when we're there.   Food keeps me coming back. I would certainly bump this up to 4 or 5 if the service/ flow of things improved.\n",
      "We were looking for breakfast food at noon on a Friday and locals said the greg's wasn't just our bet bet  but pretty much the only option in town. I ordered off menu (note if you ask nicely they'll prepare your eggs any way you want them! I got the Greek brekky with poached eggs and man was it a delight!) their specials are clearly the showcase. Everything sounds delicious  is served hot and fresh with huge portions! Also they have soy milk for those of us with lactose issues.   Opens at 8  closes at 3  best breakfasts I've seen in manyunk and served all day!\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent! Finally  a good and reasonably priced breakfast spot on Main St! $20 for two is always a win in my books.  I went with the special  Strawberry Chocolate Chip Pancakes  with a side of bacon. Mmmmm.  My fiancé tried the pork roll  egg and cheese on an English Muffin  also delicious . Staff was very friendly and speedy with their service. It appears they also do take out.  Go try Greg's !\n",
      "This is a great little spot in Manayunk for breakfast brunch. The food is always fresh  high quality and incredibly delicious for a very reasonable price. And...they have TOTS! I love me some home fries but tots will win out every time. Everyone there is very nice  I haven't had a bad experience yet! The only downfall is it's a tiny place  so expect a bit of a wait to be seated.\n",
      "I haven't tried my food yet u arrived at 9:08 it's 9:45 am and im leaving. After being told to sit where ever there is a menu  I looked around the was barely anyone at the place  I assumed it would be a quick in an out. So our waitress (didn't introduce herself idk her name  there may be really nice servers there don't wanna bash them  she was my server and she is the one who was extremely rude to me  thin white girl with tattoos on one arm) says what would you like to drink. I told her we are on a time crunch we were ready to order she says I'll take your drink order first then come back  ok. Anyway she comes back with our drinks after about 5 minutes which is cool then we order after about half hour we ask for the food to be boxed and we would just take it to go  this is when her attitude  which already sucked changed for the worst. I've NEVER had a trashier waitress in my life she throws syrup in the bag when I ask her for an extra  she had given me one half filled container initially and the pancakes are fairly large  so I asked her if she is having a bad day  I mean everyone is entitled to that  she says no im fine. I say well you're certainly not acting fine she refused to make eye contact with me when speaking I paid for my food and said I hope you have a better day. Idc how great the food is im writing this while driving home fuck that place!!! I will never go back the vibe was awful she's literally the worst server  human being I've encountered in a while. I was looking for a place closer to home to replace Sabrina's cafe. I'll stick to Sabrina's where they have class and business about themselves. Truly horrific experience this am. Way to start a Friday!\n",
      "Great place  Great food  I hope it is around for a long time in manayunk.\n",
      "This is my 3rd time to this Mad Rex and this is my 3rd AMAZING experience. I brought my family here to celebrate my brothers 21st birthday and the staff was super nice and the food came quickly and very very well prepared!  The cooks take great pride in their food  the bartenders take pride in the drinks and the servers take great pride in their service. To date  this is my favorite restaurant and i am always happy to bring new people here because i know the impression will always be a good one!  Thank you so much to the management staff and to the owner for really thinking outside of the box and running an amazing place! I WILL be back.  I highly recommend check this place out\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mad Rex had an awesome feel to the inside of the restaurant  however i ordered a steak off the survivor menu and it almost wasn't edible due to how poor the cut was. there was more fat than beef. i was excited to try cooking on the lava rock but it didn't do too much for me after seeing the cut of steak i received. if i found out they fixed this issue i would return. otherwise id spend my money elsewhere.\n",
      "Loved it~cool spot  great food!  Absolutely enjoyed myself!  Food and menu are creative  very energetic vibe and great drink menu!\n",
      "\n",
      "Awesome first time here! Strong drinks and good food.  Funky and cool decor and chill vibe. Nice layout and amount of space. Very accommodating as well. I definitely will be back to try the rest of their strong cocktails. Teresa and Erica rock!\n",
      "Like many  I was sooooo interested to check this place out. We went around lunch so it was DEAD- and they sat us next to the bathrooms but next to one of the owners (the man who's face was plastered all over Fishtown for fraud) schmoozing a potential investor and going on and on about how \\they're the number one restaurant in philly\\\" which I had to laugh at. I found the food to not have much flavor at all but our sever was sweet but SO OVERWHELMING. Must have checked on us 10+ times.\"\n",
      "Mad Rex was a great all around experience! Food was fantastic and it was fun cooking on the lava rocks. The complimentary hummus they put out for each table is legit. I also was a big fan of the sugar cane sodas.   Friendly and knowledgeable staff who all were very attentive with the exception of the hostess. She seemed very overwhelmed. I'll give her a pass since it's a new establishment  but taking off one star since she checked us in for our reservation then sent another party to our table.    Definitely will be back!\n",
      "The place is hella cool. Great vibe. The fact that there's a DJ is cool. I haven't tried the VR room yet but it looked okay through the glass.  Food: The bread they give you while you wait is EPIC. The flavor and taste are great. The flatbread pizza was a bit dry.   Drinks: Nice  stiff beverages here. I wish the drink menu was more expansive  Overall It was a great addition to the city physically but the drinks and food could use a boost in quality. Cost was right on for what you got. Staff is okay.\n",
      "It's a good thing I've had a few weeks to cool off from my experience at Copabanana before writing this review or it might not have been pretty. Anyhow  I came during university city restaurant week and will never return. We sat outside and there were kids playing football right near the tables and being loud. We moved to the other side of the restaurant (still outside) and the kids made there way over to us and continued playing. We couldnt get away. We went to a table inside. Food was terrible. Steak was fatty and overcooked and mashed potatoes werent fresh. The waitress was about the only thing good about this place. She agreed on the steak and took it back. Came back with chicken as I asked for and it was like biting into rubber bands. All in all it was a disaster and I'll never return. 1 star for the waitress.\n",
      "I went last night with a few friends and let me say I was impressed  not necessarily with the quality of the food (nothing wrong with it by any means) or the decor  but the servers: how they don't kill every 4th customer is beyond me. I heard tables on both sides of us giving the most ridiculous of complaints to our their server. Both tables were demanding as hell and already said loudly to eachother that they weren't tipping because of x  y and z reasons  and then were dumbfounded that there's a gratuity on their bill (it says it in the menu  anything over $50) their server  smaller girl so with purple hair  carried upwards of 4 plates at once  explained the menu perfectly and had an eagle eye for every table in her section and dealt with ridiculous complaints like a true professional. Thumbs up and five stars to the staff  customers  learn how to be basic humans  or stay home.\n",
      "It's been quite a while since I've done the college bar thing and quite frankly I wouldn't bother with a review because we've all been there (speaking of the environment) But my friend had a bday party in the private room downstairs.   First I appreciated that because we were on a guest list I didn't have to pay a cover  get frisked or have my handbag rummaged through. I was however scared to death to descend the the very steep staircase that led to the private room teetering on my heels. I held the railing for dear life.  Once downstairs I have to say that I was sorely disappointed with the space. There was absolutely nothing special about it. Just a hodgepodge of tables and chairs  some random booth seats and a bar. No decor  nothing that gave you the specialness of being in a private space. Me and my party pal felt like we had just been shoved into someone's basement.   Also I was so damn hot I couldn't stay down there. Unlike upstairs where the parameters are all open windows  the basement was cave like. My gf and I made our way back up stairs and nabbed two seats at the bar where we remained for the rest of the night.   Yikes Copa  you can do better.\n",
      "This is the worst service I have had at a restaurant in Philadelphia. First  they charged myself and the rest of my group a $5 cover  but then proceeded to seat us outside. The server forgot about us and we eventually were able to put our drink orders in. When they came   we had lower than average margaritas and sangrias. I wouldn't come back here again.\n",
      "My friends and I went here one time for margaritas  and we sat outside. We were charged a $5 cover  and I have literally NEVER encountered as horrible service as I have at Copa. After we got drinks we didn't see the waitress again. We actually had to go inside to close our tab.\n",
      "I really love this place and I haven't quite figured out why...  The bathroom is usually pretty nasty  and slowly but surely they're replacing all the music on the jukebox with bland soft rock bands...  But above all this are two words that give me gastological goosebumps:  SPANISH FRIES  And if you've had them (with melted cheddar of course  not that greezy spray-on cheese) you'll know why they deserve all capitals and a separate paragraph...effin' amazing. jalapeno peppers  cooked onions  melted cheddar  and old bay...this much fried goodness should be one of the seven deadly sins...  On top of that the hurricanes and pink lemonades margaritas kick-ass (get a double  it's more like a triple...boo-yah!!)  the pomegranate margarita is quite delctable as well  in fact its hard to go wrong with their flavored margaritas....on second thought stay away from the mango  it kinda reminds me of cough syrup with a lollipop left in it  They added a downstairs which helps with overflow  but lacks the bright open airiness of upstairs  and kind of feels like being on punishment when all of the cool (and early) people hog up the space by the upstairs bar. But fret not  the food is just as good and the drinks are never weak.  Flat screens that often show soccer  occasional live music  and a fun local crowd (especially on Monday) who refuse to let another neighborhood joint be bastardized by UPenn students (they can all have MarBar!)  now it's all coming back to me why I love this place...\n",

      "4 stars for 1/2 off Burger Tuesdays.  personal favorites: San Remo and Burger Benedict friends's favorites: Carribean  I come here every Wednesday during the school year. The burger deal is absolutely fantastic  and the burgers are delicious! Copa is usually busiest at noon on Wednesdays. The line is quite long during the school year around noon  and the line dies down after 1:30 pm. Copa is great for 2 people and also great for large parties. They have a basement that's great for accomodating large parties.  This is a popular lunch spot for the Penn student/faculty community and anyone who works in the Penn medical system.\n",

      "I haven't been here in a few years  but I see they have managed to maintain good quality staff who are friendly.  We yelpers know this is a rare trait today in the service industry.  From what I remembered - they have cool happy hour specials each day and when I was there - I see this continues.    As stated  the service is friendly and they are prompt.  I like the outdoor seating during the sea on.  I like the price points and the food is consistently good.  If you haven't tried it yet - give them a go - you don't have to wait for restaurant week either because they offer a Prix-Fixe menu on Mondays and Tuesday for $25.00 - that's a good deal.\n",
      "I just went to Bourbon Blue for New Years Eve 2010. My boyfriend and I had six guests from out of town staying with us and we were looking for a good deal for New Years Eve in Manayunk. We paid $60 pp for a ticket that included 4 hours open bar  and a $20 gift card to use in the future. Overall their New Years Eve party was good. Downstairs got a little crowded (since I don't think they had a DJ upstairs until later in the night). The bartenders were a little strict about drink limits but seemed to relax as the night went on. If we went back next year I would buy one of the cheaper New Years tickets. Everyone else seemed to get exactly the same thing that we did at the higher ticket price (with the exception of the gift cards).   Brunch - We went back a couple days later for brunch to use our $20 gift cards and everyone was pleased with the food. I had the Eggs Benedict with the crab cake and I will definitely be back to have that again!\n",
      "\n",
      "Happy hour here is amazing. For dinner they often do live music and on nice days you can sit outside overlooking the canal. The filet tips appetizer is AMAZING and we order it every time we go. Their burger is delicious. I'm not a big fan of their gumbo and jambalaya - I just don't think they have enough spice flavor. It's a great place for a date night or for eating outdoors.\n",
      "Bourbon blue is a nice break from the rest of the main street bar and restaurant scene. There are still some of the inevitable annoyances that come with the area like limited parking and occasional loud crowds as it gets later on friday and saturday nights  but come on people what do you expect? Its manayunk and you are going to run into these problems anywhere you go.  I do find on average it is quieter than most bars/ restaurants in manayunk. Whether this is because its located off of main street or the fact its a high price range than many of the other hot spots I don't know. The atmosphere is pretty low key and is good for a date or just hanging out with a small group of friends.  The food and drinks are delicious! I often go with friends open friday because of their all you can eat ribs and snow crab special. Even though the dealing is amazing and the ribs and crab are delicious I still have to get the Chesapeake chicken  which is to die for! the bar tenders are awesome and they have a decent range of craft beers. My friends go for the hurricanes  very similar to the drinks the serve on bourbon street (I believe they have a limit because of the high amount of alcohol per drink)  Overall though  a must try restaurant in manayunk for american food and drinks with a bit of cajun flare.\n",
      "Had a horrible experience on New Year's Eve. My group spent over $400 on the 3 course dinner and open bar tickets ($100 a piece). However  were treated like walk-ins. DESPITE 9:30 pm reservations  we (group of 4) were not seated until 10:45 pm. In fact  upon arrival we were greeted by the hostess telling us that \\our\\\" table was not clear because the previous parties had not cleared the table yet. Cut to 10:20 pm when we finally asked to speak to the manager  who greeted our concern with intent looks of exasperation. We were offered cocktail tables in bar area as a solution - which  obvious was unreasonable considering how crowded the bar area was getting. Finally  seated at a proper table by 10:45 pm. You would think the manager would offer some words of kindness or extend an extra courtesy  right? Well  no. Shame on him.   The open bar was not too shabby. No premium liquor included  however. Here's the kicker: you could not order anything \\\"on the rocks\\\". Instead  you would have to opt for \\\"neat\\\" because apparently ice was too much to ask for IN your drink. Not too bad  though. I'll just order a cup of ice to go with it. Problem solved.   Everything about this place was unorganized and I will not return  EVER. I could have been treated worse for less money and felt better about it. I will forever recall the manager's reaction to us and find it hard to believe he is responsible for running a business...let alone on NYE. It's unfortunate because the food was good and by other reviews it seems the happy hour is pretty decent.\"\n",
      "We recently ate at Bourbon Blue during Manayunk's Restaurant Week. Started off right with nightly drink special  ($5 house Martinis)  and bruschetta. Entrees were all good  Jambalaya  Southern fried chicken with gravy  and Creole Caprese pasta with blackened chicken. Liked our server too. Only downside was we were seated next to a table with a very large and noisy party. Would recommend you give it a try.\n",
      "We bumped into this place by chance! Its a gem in the rough! Love the filet mignon appetizer. It was tender and juicy. I can eat three or four of them. The gumbo Yaya was a steal for five bucks! And the jambalaya was to die for!!!  We'll definitely come back for the half price happy hour!!!\n",
      "My boyfriend and I come here occasionally. So this review is from my experience over the span of a year & some change. The service is usually pretty bad  some times to the point where we say we wouldn't go back. But living in Manayunk leaves your options pretty slim. The bartenders are mostly awful. The red head is always miserable looking. And guy who is usually bartending with her is really bad. He will ignore you trying to get his attention while he holds conversations with other customers. Also  he will very obviously grab or slap the red head bartender's ass right in front of everyone. And since she never smiles I can't tell if she's happy about it or not. But it's incredibly unprofessional and frankly  sexual harassment. So  he's a creep. Now onto the food- it's ok. It's overpriced. They have two vegan options: a salad  or sweet potatoe fries. (Insert the emoticon of me shooting myself). Last night when I was there  they were out of veggie burgers. Awesome. When I was just vegetarian and not vegan  there were obviously a few more options  but not much. And risotto for $18?! And that's without adding any of the protein up charges. My boyfriend eats meat so he can order anything. He loves the filet tip sandwich and a couple other things. Overall  I don't enjoy going here simply because  just like the rest of Manayunk (for the exception of Couch Tomato & Taqueria)  there are awful options for people who don't eat meat! This really should be addressed. We (veggie lovers) spend money too!\n",
      "First time here met a friend for drinks and a bite to eat. Nice place  trendy  clean not a large menu. But  enough to find something to eat. Also not as Cajun as I had hoped. Good to fair beer selection on tap n bottles. The service was first class and our server was very polite and attentive. Thanks\n",

      "Almost empty on a Thursday morning.  Bright  friendly interior.  Rival brothers coffee was plentiful.  I could actually have done without the cucumber water... It was more than a hint of cucumber. We had the savory Dutch baby and the eggs Benedict.  Both were delicious.  I would not have thought that fried bologna under an egg  and creamed chipped beef on top  would be appealing.... But honestly  it may have been the best single thing I've ever had for breakfast. My only quibble was our side order of bacon... It came so crispy  it approached jerky consistency.   This isn't a cheap breakfast... The bill approached 40. For 2 coffees  2 entrees and the side of bacon.  But I didn't mind.... It was all creative  different  and fun.\n",
      "My daughter and her boy friend recommended The Dutch one beautiful Saturday morning. We were lucky enough to get a seat outside. There were so many delicious choices we had trouble deciding. I finally ordered the baby Dutch with fruit and my husband ordered the Bread Pudding French toast. Both were delicious!  We will be back to try some of the other specialties.\n",
      "Great staff and ambiance. However the food is very lacking. I ordered the French onion soup special  side of potatoes and salmon platter. The french onion soup was very sweet and the broth tasted too watered down which made the flavors feel very disconnected. The potatoes were okay  hard to mess up potatoes but overall pretty bland. The worst was the salmon platter. It came with a salad  tomato and cucumber slices and an English muffin. Everything was covered in black pepper  and not a little bit of nice coarse ground pepper  but a powered coating on everything to the extreme. It totally overpowered the flavor of all the ingredients  except I was able to taste 1 tomato because it had gone bad and had that rotting tomato taste that overpowered even the pepper. I was really looking forward to adding this spot to my brunch rotation but sadly I won't be coming back.\n",
      "Simply put - the best place for breakfast or brunch in the city.  The Huevos Rancheros are profoundly memorable...!!  The Ana Banana pancakes superb.  The place is creative and comfortable  warmly welcoming and astonishingly unique  all at the same time.\n",
      "This is truly a great neighborhood place! We went for brunch this past weekend on a warm Sunday morning. Being unfamiliar with this area of the city  we didn't know what to expect and were so pleasantly surprised to find a small  cozy cafe-style place similar to ones I've been to in parts of Brooklyn and East Village in NYC. The staff was welcoming  the room was airy and bright with open windows to let in the breeze  and the food was excellent. While the menu is not huge  the offerings are of extremely high quality and they offer daily specials in addition. The uitsmijter was excellent...guanciale and gouda cheese on top of rye toast with perfectly prepared sunny eggs. The salad that accompanied it was bright and acidic to offset the richness of the dish. The balogna eggs benedict was also great...though very filling with the SOS gravy. While we would have loved to try more  we were too full. This just gives us more reason to return!\n",
      "The food is good but the service is the reason for the 3 stars. They have a sign on their door that says on weekends and holidays they won't seat incomplete parties. So when I got there  my boyfriend was a few minutes behind me. There were several open tables inside or outside but I still had to wait to be seated until my bf got there. They asked me to wait outside because the place is so small. I was willing to let that slide. But once we get menus there's a note on them and in the restaurant saying \\we're small so please leave when you're done and paid\\\". So don't go here for a leisurely breakfast. Another thing I could have let go but it took an hour from when we were seated to when we saw food. They're really concerned with their turnover but it seems like they're their own turnover problem. Food was good but also not worth the hour wait and not worth the unwelcome feeling the restaurant exudes.\"\n",
      "Holy $#!+ - cancel any other brunch plans and come here.  Yelp failed me when searching for brunch  so I hit the googles and found THIS place.  If there was a 6 star available it would be here.  First  the place was packed.  A good sign.  We sat at the bar and were entranced by the show of the chefs just doing art in perfect sync.  It was beautiful and seamless. These guys were having fun too.    Then there was the food!! Everything gorgeous and brilliant.  David had the savory Dutch and his first bite yielded an \\oh my god\\\" that is rare for David.  His only regret was not having room to finish it.  Says the sausage was amazing.  I had a mushroom omelet that couldn't be beat.  They kept walking by with good looking stuff and were super friendly - telling me what each thing was.  One was a chorizo tot that the chef gave us a sample of.    NOW the only regret is that they are on the right coast and we live on the left! So - take my advice brunch goers - come here.  Oh and the price - $25 for both of us!  We tipped 100% for the wait staff and added same to the chef's tip pitcher (which  btw  is easily overlooked - so look for it!).\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was our first time dining at The Dutch and it was wonderful. My husband and I are moving in the neighborhood and we were told this restaurant was great. Our server  Becca was fast  courteous and made you feel like you've been going there for years. The food was fresh and delicious. We now have our first favorite restaurant in our new neighborhood!!!\n",
      "Among the restaurants that serve dumplings in Chinatown  Shang Hai 1 is definitely one of the best and probably even better than the dumplings at Dim Sum Garden. I ordered the Shanghai Crabmeat Pork Soup Dumplings  Pan Fried Soup Dumplings  and Six Treasures over Noodles. Both soup dumpling dishes (each had 6) were really delicious. Just poking a hole into the dumpling  allowing the hot juice to ooze out  is a wonderful sight. I recommend to combine the sauce with the dumpling sauce (found on the table) to makes the whole experience delicious and worth lasting. However  the Pan Fried Soup Dumplings was a different story. In fact  it tasted like a soup dumpling but with a 'bao' texture. Rough on the outside. It wasn't bad  but definitely recommend the regular soup dumplings than pan fried. In addition to this  the 6 treasures over noodle was ironically horrible. From the name  I thought this was a signature dish and supposed to be really good.   NOPE. It was basically a noodle drowned with chili oil. There was supposed to be meat in this dish  but wasn't able to taste it because the whole dish basically tasted like chili oil.  Service  however  was very friendly and food came out pretty fast.   Loved the Crabmeat Pork Soup Dumplings  but overall  Shang Hai 1 is not great.\n",
      "Solid experience. The staff was super friendly and prompt to refill your water tea before you could even get halfway finished.  We wanted to try a few things and we loved everything. It's so cheap compared to some of the other similar well-known restaurants.  The items we ordered even tasted better!  Highly recommend the soup dumplings as they're one of the best I've had. Also loved the beef scallion pancake. I could see myself craving this. I loaded it up with the chili provided at the table.   Can't wait to go back!\n",
      "Great food  affordable pricing! Normally  the GF and I have to head into NYC for our favorite dish  Shanghai soup dumplings. We've tried other restaurants in Philly  but always leave disappointed. Finally  we tried Shanghai 1 on a friend's recommendation  and we were very pleased. Both the pork and crab + pork soup dumplings were amazing. The dumplings had a great amount of broth and flavor  and relatively thin wrappers. Staff was very friendly  and the food came quick. We have finally found our go-to dumpling spot in Philly!\n",
      "My first meal on a trip to Philadelphia  Very good service  everyone walking by the table is involved. Food was perfect  we had pork pot stickers  beef chow fun which was excellent- plenty of onions and napa cabbage stalks sliced finely for texture  and tofu with ground pork. Tea was roasted rice  my cup was refilled everytime it was half full. Highly recommended.\n",
      "This review reflects only on the Xiao Long Bao  Beef Scallion Pancakes  Crispy Salted Chicken and Dam Dam (sic?) Noodles  all of which are on the Dim Sum Appetizers menu.    We chose Shanghai 1 specifically for their reputation for good XLB as described by many Yelpers.  The shop is another of those long narrow houses with tables running along the north wall all the way to the restroom.  It is attractive enough with artificial flowers on each table and modern wall hangings.  The service is fast and friendly  especially if Mandarin is spoken in the exchange.    We found the Soup Dumplings (XLB) to be very good.  The skin was thin  the soup hot and savory  and the ground pork filling  soft and tasty.  The table rocket with the dumpling vinegar was a great tool for squirting into the open pouch once the top knot was bitten off to suck out the broth.  We liked them so much  we ordered another bamboo steamer of 6 after finishing everything else.    The Beef Scallion Pancake was likewise very enjoyable.  I did not find it overly oily given it was fried in that scalding fluid  and the beef within was tender and brought to sweet life with the Hoisin Sauce in which it had been prepared.  The Crispy Salted Chicken was their take on the fried chicken craze.  The chicken was tender  but the breading a might over-fried to a too-dark brown.  The pieces were very small and included many droplets of plain dough without any meat within.  While the taste was okay  the overall impression was underwhelming.     Both the XLB and Pancakes were winners  while the Crispy Fried Chicken left something to be desired. I leave it to others to discuss the relative merits of the XLB created by the other shops known for this Shanghai delicacy  Dim Sum Garden and Sakura Mandarin.  If we had stopped with the first three dishes all would have been quite content.  Our son was still hungry and wanted some noodles.  He ordered the Dam Dam Noodles with Chili Sauce hoping to top off his meal with some spicy carbs.  At 19  he can afford to do that.  Unfortunately  he was disappointed with this dish.  He complained that it was tasteless and bland.  He left half of it in the bowl and declined to take the rest home. Perhaps  we should have known given the exotic spelling of the dish.    We will stick with the Xiao Long Bao and Scallion Pancakes on future visits.\n",
      "We tried Shang Hai 1 on a caprice as we were looking for somewhere new. We were vacillating back and forth between Shang Hai 1 and the Hidden Gem Cafe. With good reviews from Yelp friends AJ  Sari  Hannah and Gerald  we chose Shang Hai 1.  The experience overall was solid. The staff was very friendly and attentive. They kept refilling our tea and water even though they were quite busy. The soup dumplings were excellent  as good as DSG  maybe better. The crispy chicken that AJ recommended was also really tasty with some interesting spices. We had a fried fish that was very good also.  Shang Hai 1 is a newer  hipper  younger type of restaurants that seem to be popping up lately in Chinatown. They take credit cards too which is a big plus. We are absolutely adding this place to our C-Town rotation.  4 Yelp stars\n",
      "I've been here 4 times  1 time actually on Chinese New Year Weekend. This place offers authentic Chinese/Shanghainese food at a reasonable price. They even have some great dishes that remind me of home  specifically Kao Fu(Marinated Gluten) and Pork soup.   I order the Xiao Long Bao and the Hong Shao Rou  both of which are the classic Shanghainese Dishes. They also have great rice cakes(?)  and the marinated gluten is standard. They actually offer a lot of dishes unique to this restaurant and Shanghai Culture  which is what I believe makes the restaurant good. The Xiao Long Bao has a nice taste  but be sure to wait a little so you don't burn your tongue with the soup. The Hong Shao Rou doesn't have too much fat  which makes it filling and rewarding. You have to taste the marinated gluten for yourself  it's hard to describe.  Service here is nice. I actually came when there was a wait once  and they offered me tea during the wait. They accept both credit and cash  which I didn't realize until my second time there. Definitely a place to go for authentic Chinese dishes.\n",
      "Worst meal ever. The pork rice is soaking in oil  waitress said this is how they make it. Bad Service\n",
      "Ask for extra spicy if you want .A authentic Shanghaiese restaurant but also offer Sichuan and Taiwanese food.From left top to right corner:Pan fried pork soup dumplings Fish fillets in chill sauce Spicy beef noodle soup and house special rice cake.I left Shang Hai 1 with my stomach being totally satisfied.Pan fried soup dumplings are tasty fish tasted fresh noodles and rice cake cooked 100% perfection.Hit Shang Hai 1 if you want treat your self well!!!\n",
      "Above average soup dumplings  beef in beef noodle soup is so tender  popcorn chicken is a great appetizer and chili beef tendon is authentic.\n",
      "1st time visitor  and will def. be back. Moist and flavorful chicken. Surprisingly  I didn't want or need any bread  roll  cornbread or biscuit. The fried rice with egg  chicken and onions was so awesome I could have just ate that by itself!! I got a large container of it to go! I didn't try the dessert but was glad they had some and will  try it next time  Atmosphere -  clean and plenty of seating. Wasn't sure which way to go in to order though  Location - easy to find  parking was ok  Price - more than I was expecting  but worth it  Staff-  friendly and looked like they enjoyed what they were doing and were happy to serve   Music -  not too loud not too soft ... just right  All together great spot and perfect for  a SFdancer! - Seat Food Dancer - Someone who dances/moves in their seat when the food is good- yep I just made that up ... well at least I gave it that name lol  cause those of y'all that dance know what I am talking bout!\n",
      "Really solid rotisserie chicken! The chicken is very flavorful and juicy. The sides are pretty decent  but can definitely be improved. The portions are quite generous and the prices are pretty fair. The staff is very friendly as well. The mixed grill is very good and is plenty of food for 2 people. I haven't tried the majority of things on the menu because the rotisserie chicken is good. I have taken many people here and they always enjoy.\n",
      "Their food is ok.  What keeps me and everyone else coming back is their sauce. Otherwise  your better off buying their sauce and eating a supermarket prepared rotisserie chicken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great food. Large portions.  Good atmosphere. Totally recommend.  I had the chicken  rice and beans and plantains. Husband had Ultimate Mixed Grill.  Everything was great.  I am really glad we tried this place.  We are definitely going back.\n",
      "Sardis chicken is unbelievably flavorful  juicy  and hot. Half chicken traditional or ask for all dark if you're feeling juicy. They have a good selection of sides that are healthy. If you are looking for more flavor though definitely try the plantains  yuca  fried rice (chaufa) and the mashed potatoes. Empanadas are delicious when they have them. Their ceviche is definitely a wild card. Served in a traditional Peruvian plate up with bib lettuce. Sweet potatoes that are boiled in cinnamon and other spices balanced so perfectly with the Cancha and boiled sweet corn. Acidic  spicy  and fresh!!! This place is awesome. Staff at times can seem overwhelmed but every time i go in i have a great experience.\n",
      "It's great to have a Peruvian chicken place in Philadelphia. Prices are very good (specially if you come with your party of 4). The best deal is the one that includes a whole chicken with 3 large sides and a 2L bottle of Inka Kola (Peru's favorite soda). Good chicken flavor  kind and helpful staff  clean space and nice musical background (Latino Music).\n",
      "When your fellow diners are policemen  taxi drivers  women in hijabs  a priest  millennial finance guys  petite Asian women  Philly locals and a strange looking guy with a small disheveled therapy dog in tow  you know you have come to the right place.  Located in a strip mall down the street from the hotel we had landed in  this Yelp recommendation did not fail to satisfy and makes us wish that this Maryland Peruvian chain 'Fast' food restaurant was as ubiquitous as the predictable Boston Market brand that can be found next door. Don't be put off by the looming presence of the dialysis treatment facility next door. I suspect a lot of their clients come running to this friendly and yummy restaurant immediately after treatment.  The extensive menu featuring Peruvian favorites with a smattering of Mediterranean type offerings (think Lamb Gyros) is a revelation and took a while to sort through.  But you shouldn't miss the house specialty- the charbroiled chicken.  My only regret was not getting the half chicken  as my smaller dark meat quarter chicken was licked clean and left me wanting for more. Moist  infused with umami lemon saltiness  this chicken ranks up there as one of the better roast chickens that have passed through these lips.  Judging by the strewn bone carcasses left by my fellow eclectic diners  they would agree. Sides of beans and Yuca were solid. Great side sauces and tempting desserts (bread pudding hit the spot).  This strip mall restaurant (lots of seating  no tableside service but they will bring your dine in order to the table) is a hidden gem.  The service was friendly and surprisingly homey and honest with that Philadelphia brotherly love toughness oozing through. A winner in my books.\n",
      "I grew up going to authentic Peruvian restaurants and was so HAPPY to find Sardi's in Philly that compared so well! I went for lunch while at SJU nearby and even before I opened my to go container  everyone in my class was salivating just from the smell!  I can't say that I have eaten anything else but their roasted chicken  mostly because it is so good  I can't say no to it when I get there. I get half with white rice  black beans and maduros (sweet plantains) for a startling CHEAP $9. I really can't believe how much food you get for such a small price. I guess it surprises me even more  because unlike the hole in the wall places I'm used to going to - this one is very clean and feels very American inside. I say American  as in it almost feels like a fast food place inside. Although they do have tables and tvs  it doesn't feel warm and cozy like other Spanish restaurants.   As many others have mentioned  their dipping sauces really are the icing on the cake with flavor. I recommend the yellow and green sauces  and mixing them together!   I am happy to see that they employ many Latinos behind the counter and that I get to practice my Spanish while I'm there. I highly recommend Sardi's and I'm hoping they open one closer to Buck's county so I can stop buying those sad & bland shoprite roasted chickens.\n",
      "This location does not live up to its standards set by Maryland locations servings are nowhere near ass big and the food is not as fresh. It also cost a tad bit more if you are from D.C.  Maryland Va area and know about Sardis don't expect it to be exactly the same. I wouldn't eat here if I hadn't been to the other locations which are all great. Sorry Philadelphia you don't get the real Sardis experience!\n",
      "Having a great experience for dinner involves many things: Food  Service  Company  Ambiance etc...  Looking at the Branzino Yelp's ratings it is all over the place from five to one stars. After my dinner last week  I understand why. The main gripe that people have is about SERVICE. However service comes from the top (management) and I believe this is where the problem comes from for Branzino. Every time I went I was never greeted in or out by a member of the management.  Last week  our food was good to very good: The Branzino and the pork were 5 stars  the appetizers 3 and the dessert 4. The service was not bad at all and I will give it 4 stars -  Where the restaurant failed was at the end. We were 3 couples and gave 3 credit cards to be divided equally (if not it is very difficult to do if based on what was consumed by each guest). The server told us that he could take only 2 credit cards - not 3 (management problem). What kind of reasoning is that??? They happily take 1 CC for 2 people  2 CC for 4 BUT for more people they accept only 2 CC (some other reviews have complained about that). There is nothing like bad service or nonsense rules like this to spoil an evening that otherwise would have been a pleasant one.\n",

      "My father gave it the highest praise he can give an eatery: I'll come here again. That's saying something if you know my dad.   That said  I don't think any of you do. So...The food first. The salads were classic and good  not great. The soup was a seriously good butternut squash rendition. And then the pastas  well  they were light and sauced perfectly. Not too much meat  but enough to make the papparadelle dish hearty. And the venison was cooked to perfection  the meat itself was perfection -- almost chocolaty in its richness. A wonderful cut of meat. Dessert-wise  the tirimisu was a miss  and the chocolate mousse was rich and hit the spot for the boys at the table  but the fig gelato is the way to go. I ate half of my mom's entire plate...  The service was great  and the staff were truly accommodating. My dad asked for a combination of two dishes with a classic sauce that wasn't on the regular menu that night  and it wasn't even the mildest problem. Not bad for a first visit!\n",
      "This restaurant is reason enough to return to Philadelphia.  Food was great.  Everything  appetizers  pasta dishes  dessert  all excellent.  Great atmosphere.  The dining scene in New York City is more formal so I had to pleasantly adjust to the slightly less formal atmosphere that is Philadelphia.  From the moment I arrived in Philadelphia I noticed that the City is younger and just a little less formal (in a good way)  I came to find it endearing.  I was a little surprised when the waiter addressed us as \\Guys\\\" rather than \\\"Gentlemen \\\" that would never happen in New York but I liked it.  The food was amazing  I loved the place.  BYOB  awesome.  This meal easily would have cost twice the amount in New York City  especially with such a nice wine.  I'm looking forward to returning...\"\n",

      "This is the 3rd time at this restaurant. The food is good  not great and had much better else where for the price but dining in the garden is why we go. We will not be going back though. Last time we were there we had an obnoxious waiter. We asked if we could have time before we ordered  he said yes then came back under 5 minutes. Our guest asked what was good on the appetizer side and he stated his two favorites but our guest did not hear him so she asked again. he snapped back I already told you. He pushed us to dine fast even though there were out door tables available all night and it was our friends birthday. When the check came we asked for change. He then came back and said that we only left $110 and the bill was $80.00. We were so irritated and felt so uncomfortable that we left the monies and said we would never go back. We live in Florida but have an apt in the city. This is on the no go list.\n",
      "Their front of the house processes need some significant improvement.  Six weeks prior to Mothers Day  my partner and I made reservations for brunch through OpenTable so we could treat his mother. Four days before Mothers Day  they canceled the reservation with no explanation.  When my partner called back  they re-booked us for our table only to call me a couple of hours later to say they'd be closed.The  back and forth was frustrating and time consuming and we had difficulty finding any reservations worth taking for Mothers Day brunch.  If they knew they would be closed  they never should have given us reservations twice.\n",
      "Went here with my boyfriend on a date night. We had a reservation and were seated immediately although we had a little trouble locating the hostess.  The restaurant was absolutely packed and little loud but we still were able talk without screaming. The crowd was a little older and did not approve of my tank top (woops).  We ordered the mozzarella and heirloom tomato appetizer and it was great as was my gnocchi and my boyfriends veal. The waitress was friendly and attentive and the check was reasonable. Will definitely return!\n",
      "There are a lot of nice aspects to Branzino  and some tasty bites.  My entree was not very good and that really overshadows the many enjoyable parts of  my dinning experience.  Sat outside early on a beautiful Saturday night.  The seating is very comfortable with cushioned wicker chairs.  The server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  The other server was very attentive in filing our water glass. Shared the grilled octopus and a small bowl of paperdelle. I really enjoyed both dishes  the pasta was especially good home made and cooked perfectly.  My issue was with my entree. The veal porterhouse which was the most expensive dish on the menu was lackluster at best.  Most of the chop was inedible gristle  and the center meat was fairly bland for veal. It was a workout to cut through to the tender parts  and was not wow'd when I got there. Seemed a waste to leave so much of a $38 chop on the plate  but I just couldn't chew or cut through it.  Branzino is a cool little spot  and they do a lot of things right. I would go back for some pasta  but I don't think I would be ordering a meat course any time soon.\n",
      "Not only was the food delicious  but the restaurant made special accommodations for our group of 12. Not only did we show up late  sadly our group of 12 dwindled to just seven. However  the wait staff didn't blink an eye. They treated us with the same care and courtesy that you'd expect from a five-star restaurant  despite the fact that our bill was essentially cut in half.  On top of that  the Caprese salad was one of the best I've ever had. Our server told us that the chef has a tomato connection  and he wasn't kidding! And the mozzarella practically melted in your mouth. The Branzino skin was perfectly crispy and seasoned - and the tiny pasta (reminiscent of Israeli couscous) mixed with the tomato/olive compote was a great balance of flavors.  The dessert potions were very generous and tasty  as was the cappuccino.\n",
      "Update: came back because I had forgotten my previous experience. Once again service was slow and bad. The table next to me ha to wait so long to order they ended up ordering to go and still had to wait to over an hour for food. As for me  I ordered the blackened tilapia Benedict. When it arrived  I pointed out to the server that it was pink and didn't look like tilapia. He assured me it was. After tasting it and confirming my suspicions that it was salmon  I told the server and was informed that they must have run out of tilapia. No other options (reordering) or discounts were offered.  I really wanted to like this place  hoped it could be my new neighborhood bar. But the service was horrible  I would have ordered much more if any of the servers that walked by had actually stopped to ask. I also made the mistake of ordering the Caesar salad. I don't normally have high expectations for a Caesar salad to begin with  but this managed to still fall short with plain  wilted iceberg lettuce and that's about it. The music in Tuesday night was great  which is why it got two stars...\n",

      "Amazing food! I was born in Louisiana and lived there for ten years and always loved Cajun food. I thought Becks in reading terminal was the closest to Cajun I was gonna get IN Philly but Catahoula proved me wrong! The food is so Authentic and yummy. I tried the hush puppies  duck jambalaya  chicken étouffée and all were so tasty too. I also tried a taste of the seafood jambalaya and shrimp étouffée and they were tasty as well. The duck has a perfectly crispy skin and very tender juicy meat that just falls off the bone. Only gripe is how small this place is  not much seating and it's more like a sports bar.\n",
      "My friend was in from NY and we couldn't decide where to go for brunch and didn't want to walk too far. After an hour long discussion deciding between green eggs  Sabrina's  and cafe lift  we decided to try something closer probably with a much shorter wait.   The restaurant was somewhat small with only one waiter. He informed us he was making Siracusa Bloody Mary's. The special was 11 dollars and included a beer. We all ended up getting a burger that had goat cheese  bacon  fried green tomatoes  BBQ aioli and came with creole spiced fries. It was absolutely delicious! I will definitely be back to try a po-boy!\n",
      "Quality food and drink in a great part of town.  Catahoula has a creole/cajun theme thing going on: po' boys  gumbo & such. The food is good. Real good. You won't go wrong with their \\My Burger\\\". It can go up against most  if not any  burger in the city.   Don't expect some obscene eighteen page beer menu here  they have a handful of taps and maybe a dozen different bottles. They are all quality picks and range in a variety of styles. The bottle selections are heavy on the Abita in keeping with their theme  which is fine by me.   Aside from the food and drink  what makes the Catahoula experience so enjoyable for me is the bar itself and its location. It has the coziness of a small corner bar  but is ample enough to handle a decent enough crowd. If it had a fireplace  it's the kind of place you would never want to leave come winter. Yes  it's that charming. It's a good place to watch a game and they're always playing great music too.   The place is a gem which has rekindled my love of Queen Village.  I like it so much that come to think of it  forget you read this review!  Nothing to see there.....just move along.  )\"\n",
      "The food was good and so was the service  but what we found to be extremely obnoxious was the fact that the owners were sitting behind us. It was super awkward. The ninety year old lady in their party kept turning around and giving my husband and I dirty looks. We are patrons  out to have a decent meal and a nice time. Not sure what her problem was  they were speaking Hebrew and we could not understand what they were saying about us  but we felt as though we were being racially profiled by the owners for being Latino. We enjoyed the food and drinks  but on principle  we won't frequent there.\n",
      "I am from Louisiana so I know what I am talking about when it comes to the cuisine. Catahoula is WONDERFUL! From the ambiance  the beer and spirits to the food  this place is great. I wish I lived in the neighborhood because they would see me every night! WHO DAT!\n",
      "1 star for food.  I cannot rate the entire place because I have not eaten inside since it became Catahoula.  I was not even planning to write this  but the private message I sent to the place has gone unanswered for almost a full month. My husband bought us gumbo and bisque to go.  Of all dishes  you would think that a nice New Orleans style restaurant should be able to deliver on these. Both dishes were inedible. The gumbo was basically sausage and rice. The roux for the bisque was not reduced so it tasted only of flour. We put both into the garbage disposal:(.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazing!  We would definitely come back again!  I found out about Catahoula from Groupon.  We got a great spend $20 and get $40 worth of food deal.  We went on a Sunday morning for their brunch menu.  The employees (chef  Kitchen staff  and bartender) were all very nice.  My husband and I ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes and the Eggs Benedict platter  that had the fried oysters in it.  That food was crazy good!!  Hot  fresh and great flavor!  The only negative thing...we ordered a cup of the gumbo to go.  When we got home and reheated it  we realized it was seriously burnt.  It probably was the bottom of the pot soup left over from the night before.  Although  that was gross  that wouldn't stop me from going back to try it again in a fresh batch.  We loved this place.\n",
      "Love this place! Great food from the apps to the dogs from all around the world  to the great sides. Plus  they've got an amazing happy hour. Highly recommend.\n",
      "Really cool unique spot. Amazing gourmet dogs  nice bar  solid draft list  a pool table and baggo corn hole for entertainment. Hope this place does well.\n",
      "Destination Dogs is actually a destination. Having only read (stalked) the menu previously  I was a little taken back to see what a formal establishment it was. There was a host  a formally dressed server to go with the table service and candlelight. And here I thought I was just going to a hotdog shop with a bar.   Having a gator obsession  I had to go with the Andouille Armstrong  which was a combined gator-shrimp hotdog with cabbage  tomatoes  jalapeno remoulade  scallions and a lemon wedge on top. My husband went with the Hebrew Hammer  which included a beef hotdog topped with potato latkes  onion and mustard.   After placing our order  it took a really long time for our food to come out. During that time  we second guessed the portion size and if we needed a side or appetizer. We also contemplated a beer  although we really weren't there to drink that night. These are gourmet dogs  but is the wait warranted? Apparently  not. Without a single complaint and complete patience on our part  our server took 50% off our check at the end of the meal and told us this wasn't the normal timetable. Phew  that's a relief.   So our food came and our side second guessing was laid to rest. This was not your tiny wiener from a hotdog stand. We had before us sausage sandwiches. I'm in the camp that the insides make the meal  but that luscious  toasty roll made a great thing even better.  Bonus points for each dog coming with a small side of chips.   The gator was no NOLA gator  but still really tasty nonetheless.  Between a hearty dog  a stellar roll and fun toppings  the Andouille Armstrong was a wiener...I mean winner.   I'm so intrigued by so many of the fun hotdog combinations and meats (kangaroo  I'm looking at you  mate!) Their beer list had a few brews that caught my eye to warrant an elongated visit.   As their name eludes  this chain knows what it takes to be a destination hotdog spot that can be fun  intriguing and a place you'd want to hang around for longer than it would normally take it eat a hotdog.\n",
      "Dogs are a novelty in many places  but at Destination Dog they get quite serious. I've never seen or eaten such a well orchestrated hot dog that is so uniquely and elegantly thought out. I ate the Charles Dog Gaulle from the international side of the menu and it was great. While I would still recommend they somehow have a basic cheeseburger available in case you are with a friend that doesn't dine in dogs  I think this bar is fun and good eating. My next attempt is a python dog (yes that is correct).\n",
      "Good stuff.  Disclaimer:  I don't really eat meat  so some of the more interesting creations are lost on me.  I've had the veg-dog and the python thing without the python -- both delicious.  Not sure if i'm just special  but it was impossible to eat the veg-dog without looking like a child and getting sauce and samosa-potatoes all over my hands and stuff.  I think the bun was too big and the whole dawg was a little unwieldy.  I ate it all  though  and was very full.  The boys both got two dogs  which seemed a little crazy to me.  The Paul Bunyan smelled like delicious breakfast.  Decent draft selection (though we had to ask  and the waiter had to show us on his serving tablet  which was a little awkward) and friendly service.  Probably 4.5 stars but not perfect because of too many meaty selections.\n",
      "Stumbled upon this gem of a place while visiting Philly for the day. What a interesting concept! The menu consists of many interesting \\hot dog\\\" choices each associated with an airport 3 letter code and inspired by the destination from domestic to international  prices ranging from around $8-$14. But don't let the pricetag scare you because they are more than substantial dogs.    I tried the following: Howlamo: Wild boar sausage w/ pork belly  chicharrones  baconaisse  scallions. Highly recommend. my only concern was that after a few bites it was quite heavy and salty  could be improved with some kind of acidic/sweet sauce.  Super filling.  Kansas city beefs: Pork sausage w/ pulled BBQ beef short ribs  coleslaw. Great choice of sweet BBQ with the savory sausage.   All sausages made in house and bread baked on premises. The bread was a real highlight  double toasted and did a great job containing the ingredients inside.\"\n",
      "Interesting concept \\hotdogs\\\" w differences toppings. It was not bad. I got the Israel - The beef hotdog was nothing special but the latkes were good. I forgot what my friend ordered. Also a beef hotdog 2 grilled onions topping which was okay. I just thought if the concept of the restaurant is around hotdog - the main star should shine more instead of the toppings. The loc is superb  we picked there bc we were catching a show over the Forrest theatre\"\n",
      "Walked here after visiting the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall. It was on our way to where we parked. When we entered we saw the bar but also a dine in area. We were seated and only waited briefly for our server.   My son and I chose one of the items off the menu. My daughters created their own dog. My son had the Scarlet  Bite and enjoyed it. I had the Rocky Balboara  it was delicious. He was able to finish his  I however was unable to finish mine. I did take it home to finish later.  While I did not see a specific children's menu  due to the food choices  my children liked the food. Other children would like it as well. One of the tvs in the bar was on a kid friendly  cartoon channel and while they may not be able to hear it they would be able to enjoy it. My son and one of my daughters would periodically glance at the screen.  The atmosphere was inviting. The food delicious. The service was phenomenal. I see us visiting again.\n",
      "Been to both locations  and they both rock!!!  Food is dynamite  drinks are awesome and the service is world class!!!\n",
      "I was fortunate enough to attend the Yelp Elite Event as my husbands +1! I started off  the evening with the peach pit cocktail made with a quite  delicious homemade peach tea vodka. We were then served an array of appetizers...Bavarian pretzels  wings  scotch eggs and the must have patatas ridiculas which lives up to its name! After this a platter of their famous dogs arrived to share. The conquistadog (chorizo)   bun mi (Cantonese sausage)  the rocky-bal-Boara (wild boar) and the one-bite-in Bangkok (Python) were fully enjoyed by our adventurous yelpers. Being somewhat unadventurous I tried the Hebrew hammer  the scarlet bite and the cyclone. They were all made with all beef hot dogs and each one was delicious. Then came dessert. The Mississippi mud pie and bread pudding were the perfect ending to our meal. Thanks Robin for inviting us to this wonderful event\n",
      "Never again.  Delivery: They will lie and tell you 45 minutes to an hour. It will  every single time  take AT LEAST 1 and half hours  and 3 phone calls asking where your food is before you get it. And I live 4 blocks away. This last time my order did not only take almost 2 hours to get to me  but it was missing items. When I called to ask where they were  they kept me on hold for 10 minutes and then hung up on me. If I hadn't paid cash  I would have disputed the charges.  I've been dining in and ordering from here for years. I will never do that again. The food is so inconsistent. Some days it's great  other days it's so full of cardamom pods it's inedible.   Skip it.\n",
      "My boyfriend and I love to come here for dinner. It's our favorite Indian restaurant in the area! Their Chicken Tikka Makhani is incredible. Great food  great service and friendly staff. BYO which is a plus!\n",
      "I REALLY wish I read some Yelp reviews before placing my delivery order from here this past Tuesday. I should have known with the generic name \\indian restaurant\\\"...   So things started off on the wrong foot when the delivery guy lied and told me he was \\\"downstairs\\\". I work near City Hall so he couldn't find parking right in front of the building and I ended up waiting a good 10 minutes for him to find parking and walk over to me to bring me my food. Didn't help that I was actually having an extremely busy day  so I could have used those 10 minutes. I wish he would have just told me when he was ACTUALLY downstairs.  The food was ridiculously bland for indian cuisine - no heat and no flavor. I ordered veggie samosas and saag paneer (what they're supposed to be known for) and both were extremely dissapointing. The only good piece of food I got was the naan. I will say they have large portions  I got about 3 meals out of the serving size -- but the second 2 times I ate the dish I had to add my own spices and sauces to make it better.\"\n",
      "Reasonable Indian fare at average prices. Ever go to places that are not bad but are not so stand out? This is one of them. In fact this may well define that category - they have a generic name and that should be some kind of a karmic choice!  We had the peshawari naan and paneer makhani. We also had a soup (Mulligatawny) and some samosas. None of them were outstanding but at the same time they were not bad. If someone ate Indian food for the first time and they chose this place  they may be surprised at the vague reference to spices (especially the hot ones) in the context of Indian food. Somehow I was not able to identify any of the normal spices I am used to (cinnamon  garlic  pepper  cardomom) in the dishes.  Just a normal Indian restaurant - what any roadside diner would be to burgers and fries.\n",
      "Very rude waiter.  The vegetable entres were rather disappointing  although the onion kulcha was not bad.  (Also their mint chutney is made with gherkins - it took me a few minutes to tell why the flavor was familiar). Definitely not worth returning.  Sitar India is a far better bet.\n",
      "They deliver thru Grub Hub too. I love this restaurant. Try the tikka masala and the vindaloo is outstanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been back twice since I wrote my original review and I still stand by it. My favorite dish thus far is definitely the Chicken Korma. Just...it's so delicious  I can't even talk about it because it's dinner time and I don't live in the city.  Service is still top notch  water always filled  etc.  It is one of the places I would take a visitor to the city if they were looking for good food. I even took my mother there after the Flower Show and she liked it!  If you're kids are well-behaved  I see no reason why they can't join the meal.\n",
      "BYOB! Bring a bottle of red  eat the delicious lamb saag and savor your meal.  Weird name though... I definitely judged a book by it's cover with the restaurant being named \\Indian Restaurant.\\\"\"\n",
      "Don't let the matter-of-fact name or the creepy mannequin doll at the front throw you off. This place is really yummy! Best Indian place that I've had in the city so far. The Lamb Vindaloo is actually spicy  and the onion kolcha is hot and delicious.   Service is also pretty good  no waiting time or pulling teeth to have your water filled.  Dependable staple every time  and is now my point of comparison whenever I'm having Indian food.\n",
      "this is an alright bar  not the kind of place you just want stop in for a drink  the atmosphere can be kind of a downer  but if you've got a big group of people and can take up the corner tables it's a great place for 5 dollar pitchers and bad jukebox songs nobody wants to admit they know all the lyrics to. few people I know have braved the food here (nothing vegan that I know of) but if you want to test the resilience of your stomach this is probably as good a place as any.\n",
      "Not sure how I came to find Oscars  I was strolling around waiting for dinner and this little cobbled street appeared out of no where right in between Street and Market Street. The bright colored lights  quaint feeling and back alley kind of feeling drew me to start walking. Unfamiliar with my surroundings  I checked the streets to make sure I knew how to retrace my steps. The sun had just dropped behind the row of building on my right and shadows crept slowly up the walls to my left. A row of tiny little shops  bars  falafel  boutiques  street level  half level up and basement level. In the midst was Oscars Tavern.   I walk in and am obviously from away because I order a Yuengling. You don't order yuengling in Pennsylvania  you order a lager. She asked big or small  I said big. The lady next to me pulled the empty stool between her and me closer to me. Her absent friend whose cigarette pack and light were on the counter never returned - when I left  they were still sitting right where they were when I got there.   The owner was tending bar as well. Very talkative and friendly. As soon as the empty hit the bar  I was asked if I'd like another.   Down the right end of the bar  a grill used to whip up cheese steaks  burgers and other fried amusingness. If I wasn't waiting to go to dinner  I could not have resisted  everything looked amazing. This place is completely local  I am sure I was the only foreigner in the joint. The line cook  the bartender and the owner knew the name of every other person that came into the bar. Bar booths  red colors  blinking lights  tall bar stools  low ceilings  small front window. My kind of place.\n",
      "I really love this bar. The perfect pre-gamer. You don't go to this bar for a great beer selection  although they've been getting a few craft beers in more. You go here to have a huge glass of cheap crappy beer  some onion rings  and watch all the interesting characters around you. Always a welcoming place.\n",
      "I ALWAYS have the best times here.  A little dive bar on Sansom has cheap beer and a no frills environment.  I went there a couple of years ago and met this guy who kept telling my friend and I to come with him to Bristol (not in a creepy way  but in a fun way).  We politely declined  and he said that cousin Earl would be upset and that he is going to tell mama over Sunday dinner.  He told us not to be late.  I won't.\n",
      "I have never been to an establishment where the bartenders and entire staff have had such an attitude and made their patrons feel like second class citizens. Specifically  the bartender Bill was so rude and obnoxious when ordering drinks it made me want to throw my drink in his face. The guy is an absolute Bum who has no business working in a Burger King. The show Bar Rescue is the only thing that comes to mind here.\n",
      "Wow  this place is a VERY locals-only kind of place. You walk in and are greeted with a the smell of fried foods and the sight of a thousand Phillies shirts. None of this is a bad thing  but a bit jarring when your previous stop that night was Franklin.  I had the massive long island (obviously) which was drinkable and --did I mention?-- massive. No regrets there. I could see myself coming back here when I'm in the mood for a no-frills night of cheap booze and sports on the TVs.  The bathrooms did  however  make me want to vomit.\n",
      "I love Oscar's Tavern. As a patron who usually doesn't frequent dives  I have to admit upon first entering I was mortified. Yes  I know it sounds ridiculous.  When I went for the first time last year it was dark  looked dirty  smelled like old beer and there was a drunk guy stumbling around and in the back that my friend and I were guessing if he was a regular or an employee. The glasses didn't look too clean and the grill was exposed and part of the bar.  Once you get past all that  you have ridiculously cheap beer in large quantities. They used to have Lionshead on tap. My love for shitty beer appreciated this. They now have PBR on tap. This warmed my heart.  I still haven't ordered any food here and don't think that I ever will because the guy cooking it skeeves me out  but my friends have drunkenly munched on fries and chicken tenders and they didn't seem too lethal.   Beware  this place is cash only and the closest ATM is in Bar 1518 a few doors only. Also  if you want the most bang for your buck  get the tall boys and Lager is always on special.\n",
      "If my life were 'Shaune of the Dead'  this bar would unfortunately be my Winchester.   The food sucks but let's be honest  you're not there to eat. One goes to Oscar's to get wasted  on the cheap. Their long islands are a bit pricey ($12) but you're getting 23 ounces of booze.   Yes  it's dingy but nobody will bother you. Unless of course  it's a waitress who cannot pronounce  \\Kenzinger\\\" but HEY! Whatever  nobody is perfect and my glass was never empty.\"\n",
      "True dIve bar where the waitress may not always remember your name but knows your order.  You can supersize your beers.  It's not for the faint of heart.  There's a lurid haze of smoke that hangs over the place and clings to your every molecule.  For some reason  I love it.  You can get a decent sized group in here.  The crowd varies based on the night  but it definitely has its share of regulars (read daytime alcoholics).  I frequented this place every Wed night all summer long and have a great store of memories.\n",
      "$3.25 PBR's and cheese fries are one way to enjoy the end of a Friday workday. If you're not a beer drinker  take a look at the placemats because they're covered with cocktail options.  The waitresses at Oscar's are friendly and usually on top of their game. Seating is almost always a problem though  but once you've got a spot it's hard not to kick back and stay for a while. Women  be mindful of the toilet paper supply  it's rarely ever stocked.\n",
      "We ordered online and the service was really great. We ordered pad se ew platter  red curry  and vegetarian dumplings. All were amazing. Would like to try again very very soon\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Service: Great. It's pretty fast and the delivery never takes more than 45 minutes.  Food: Not too impressive. I'm not a fan of their pad thai at all. However  their tofu options and their calamari are really good!\n",
      "I was wandering around University City before catching a show at World Live Cafe.  I saw this place and decided to stop in as I had not had any pad thai in a good while.  I ordered the vegetable spring rolls and the vegetable pad thai.  The spring rolls were way too greasy.  But the presentation on the plate with a few bites of salad was nice.  Then the pad thai came out.  It was absolutely disgusting.  Again way to much oil.  The vegetables were obviously from a frozen mix (yuk!) and the tofu was way undercooked.  I had two bites and then for the first time in my life I sent a dish back.  I've had much better pad thai in small town Indiana of all places.   When the waitress asked if I wanted to substitute something else I politely declined.    I would give it one star  but I did not have to ask to for the pad thai to be taken off the bill.  Their other dishes might be good  but I wouldn't return here even for a free meal.  Update:  51/6/08 I've now changed the rating from two stars to one star.  I would change to zero if I could.  The reason for the change is received a message from the restaurant through Yelp that was impolite to say the least.  While the staff in the restaurant were very courteous  the person in charge of their Yelp account really needs to learn the meaning of tact.\n",
      "Pattaya is more than worth the minor hike from Penn for the lunch special! It's one of the best places in the area to take guests who come to speak at our department -- Pattaya can easily accommodate a large group for a late lunch  and they're affordable enough for our student wallets. $9 for three dishes -- it's hard to do better than that.   Granted  the food is not spectacular  but it is pretty darn good Thai food close to campus with all the regular things I need as a voracious vegetarian green curry consumer -- spiciness (when I remember to ask for it)  coconutiness  etc.  and their veggie spring rolls  though a bit on the greasy side  are delicious.   They don't even try to remember who ordered what  and tend to call out our orders on arrival at the table like auctioneers. We do usually have 8-10 people though  and they are always very patient with us  even when we squeak in half an hour before the kitchen closes.\n",
      "I would give this place 5 stars  but the portions are too small for me. I've got a big appetite and a small bank account  so when I throw down for some Thai  I want to indulge. Unfortunately  I always have to order two entrees at this place. And I eat half my wife's portion. So  do the math.  The good thing  though  is the food is amazing. We usually get Pad Thai  Green Curry  and Spicy Basil Duck or something. It's an amazing treat. My only complaint is the price ought to get us some more food.   3.5/5--I'll round up to 4 stars since I crave the food so much.\n",
      "Ordered food while working on a 24-hour call shift at the hospital- and it was a great bite to keep our team's morale high. The food was delivered quickly. Granted  the pad see yew was a bit dry and blandly spiced  but they placed plenty of vegetables and tofu in the mix.  They have a big menu available plus all of the standard options (curries!).\n",
      "I love this place!!!  Great thai food  nice service  nice ambiance. Whenever I want Thai food in Philadelphia  this is where I go.  The Pad Thai is delicous!\n",
      "I agree with other reviews which point out the Pattaya Grill does not pretend to be fine dining. Nonetheless  I've eaten there about 4 times and the food has never disappointed. The portions are sizeable without being overwhelming. I always enjoy the soups whether I order Tom Yum or a coconut soup. Also  their mixed drinks are delicious and strong. My favorite is definitely the Pink Ginger Lemonade which is made with ginger vodka made on premises. Really yummy.   After eating there last night  the only thing I have to say about the service is that we ordered drinks  appetizers and a main course and the drinks didn't come until after the main course came. Very annoying. Aside from this  the service was so non-existent that I have nothing more to say.  We tip at 20% almost everytime we eat out  but since there was hardly any service last night  there was hardly any tip.\n",
      "Very good vegetarian food  but their menu doesn't exactly match the one shown on google and yelp\n",
      "Why are you reading this? Run to Harmony now! I grew up eating here and LOVE it. I heard they changed managers or ownership or something and I haven't been since. But if the menu is anything like it was about 4 years ago...its delicious. The sesame chicken or general tso are my favorite! Seriously  I'll probably dream about this food tonight.  If you are vegetarian  bring your meat eating friends here and they won't believe their taste buds.\n",
      "I love this restaurant so much  though I like cooking whenever i am not having my own food the next best deal for me is NEW HARMONY. this stands out to me to be the best in philly. i tell everyone i know about this restaurant even non vegans love it.\n",
      "Absolutely wonderful  this is my go-to comfort food place. Sesame beef and walnut jumbo shrimp are my favorite  but I love so much of their menu (wonton soup - also incredible!)   I also just love the feel of the restaurant  it feels cozy  it's never too loud  and the owners are nice. It's almost never crowded  but I wish it was  because I love it and I want them to always have tons of business.\n",
      "So my first impression was  \\Oh  I should leave...\\\" But I mustered my courage and went in. It doesn't look very...uh....clean... from the outside or the inside... But  I was starving and really hoping for the best... So they sat me kinda off to the  side. Not really a problem....I suppose. So I ordered: Turnip Cakes. They were pretty good. I kinda craved them since I haven't been to my beloved dim sum since I became veggie. They were crispy. Not much else happening tho. They gave me the sauce that usually comes with Peking duck (the name escapes me). That was different and they kinda needed it.  Spinach dumplings and dragon dumplings. were a disappointment because they are essentially the same thing  just different colors. Like your typically veg. gyoza filling. Not bad not good.  Taro Cakes. They were strange...just strange. Crispy crust but nothing else going on. I could taste taro....maybe?  Imitation shrimp with walnuts. Actually pretty tasty. I could be fooled. BUT  they served the shrimp with the vegan set sauce on top of broccoli with soy sauce on it. Just odd. Served with brown rice.   Vegan Char Siu Bao. Nope. Doughy AF. No  flavor. Maybe microwaved with a damp paper towel?   So I guess the message here is  this is one of those places where the fake meats are the way to go.    Not terrible but just not super special other than being a vegan Chinese restaurant.\"\n",
      "I once found a place like this in Atlanta and I never thought I would find one again. What a gem!  I placed an order of sweet and sour chicken and pork buns for pickup.   What was awesome: 1. They packaged my fried chik'n bits separate from the sauce (good thing too because it took me a good forty minutes to get home).   2. They gave me brown rice.  3. They included delicious egg drop soup for free.   4. EVERYTHING WAS VEGAN AND DELICIOUS!! I have to admit though  the pork rolls were a bit doughy  but yummy at the same time.   This meal cost me $10 and I couldn't even finish half. I probably would have gotten three meals out of this (I had to leave for my flight though so my friends will enjoy the rest instead).   I'm giving a four because I've only been there once and I can't speak for all the dishes as I had a very typical and probably easy to make meal. Still  delicious! Vegans  vegetarians  and meat-eaters will love the food!\n",
      "This place is amazeballs.  I really  really wish we had a comparable place in Raleigh / Durham / Chapel Hill  NC.  The service is just fantastic as well: courteous  gracious  and welcoming.  No weirdness even though I  on a business trip  was dining alone  you know how sometimes you can tell your server is irritated to be waiting on a one top  which is why I usually eat at the bar when I'm traveling for work  but I didn't have to worry about that at all here.  The menu is so massive  I found it challenging to choose!  The won ton soup was off-the-charts good!  For my entree  I went with the General Tso's \\chicken \\\" which probably wasn't what I should have ordered  I found it too salty for my taste  and I prefer dishes with tons of veggies (so my ill choice was my own fault). This dish was not bad  certainly  but not something I'd slap my mother about.  The imitation chicken is substantial and filling  if not a bit on the squeaky side  as far as consistency goes  and perhaps a tad dry.  The dish was served  however  with tons of brilliant green steamed broccoli  which was just heavenly.  Next time I'm in Philly  I will visit New Harmony again  for sure!  I definitely want to try the lunch buffet (which had just closed down when I stopped by at an odd time) and this amazing karaoke everyone keeps talking about.\"\n",
      "I first tried New Harmony last November on a weekend trip to Philly. I ordered a couple dim sum apptizers  the wonton soup and also a mock chicken dish.  All were tasty and I was particularly impressed with the variety on the menu.  As a vegan  it seems that its not that hard to find vegan options at many Chinese restaurants-- there are usually at least a few vegetable dishes and mock meat dishes to chose from at the restaurants i have been to.  But never have I seen an entire vegan menu-- complete with appetizers  entrees  dim sum  and even dessert!  I wanted to try so much but of course neither my wallet nor my belly would let me  so I knew I would have to come back in the future.   So  this past Sunday when I found myself in Philadelphia once again  I stopped by New Harmony and ordered several dishes as carry out to take home with me.    I ordered wonton soup  spare ribs  chicken satay  fried shrimp balls  steamed dumplings  pork buns  basically all sorts of appetizers I normally don't find vegan versions of!  And once again I was not let down.  Even my carnivious boyfriend was impressed with the vegan chicken! I also ordered the Singapore Noodles  and was delighted with them! The prices are good  the service is great and I can definitely see why this place is so popular.   I can't wait to go back to Philly again soon  I know for sure New Harmony will be on our list of go-to spots for Vegan food when in the city of Brotherly Love!\n",
      "I'm just in town for work  but someone recommended this on Facebook. I'm so glad they did! I am gluten free and vegan and was craving good Chinese food. I had the sesame chicken which was tofu done with rice flour  and also had the potato pancakes. Absolutely delicious! The owners son waited on me  and he was awesome! So helpful  and so friendly. I can't wait to come back!\n",
      "Still coming back a decade later  so something must be good! A favorite dish is the one that resembles beef with broccoli--lots of broccoli with a wheat gluten-looking \\meat\\\" that was really good.   If you don't eat shrimp but wish you could  their imitation shrimp is eerily like the real thing in look and texture.   I loved the green beans  too.   I'd recommend this to folks skeptical about vegetarian cuisine. It should win them over.\"\n",
      "Laurel was soooooooo good...like  really good. But was it $600 for two  good? Probably not. Wait  maybe? The amount of truffles they shaved over the gnocchi was redunkulous. I think we ate a whole nugget alone (Not really  but close). So  yes  it was worth it. But  I will say  after traveling around the world and paying for many high-dollar meals (Which $600 may not qualify for?)  Laurel just doesn't really stand out to me [other than the truffles]. If you have cash to burn - GO! If not  save your money and splurge elsewhere (I really can't recommend anywhere in Philly in the 'BLOW YOUR MIND  BEST MEAL I'VE EVER HAD' category  though tons of perfectly cooked meals for significantly less).  Enjoy!\n",
      "The best meal I've had in Philadelphia! The food was SO delicious and the service was top notch. We had the 7 course tasting menu and every single dish was 5 5 stars!  I didn't think that was possible until I dined here. I especially loved the albacore tuna   the torn scallop  the ricotta gnocchi  and the pudding with puffed grains.  We love it here so much  we plan on coming every season to try new dishes!\n",
      "Ambiance is quant.  Service is top notch.  Food is creative and well presented.  Prices are appropriate for quality of food.  Most importantly  the food is delicious.  I recommend the gnocchi  which I ordered without panceta.  The Walu was also amazing.  The chocolate pudding was surprisingly light.  Big tip - BYOB!  This is a huge plus of you want to avoid corkage (I dont think they charge).  Also I called and got in the next week.  I know they book out  so check their Twitter or call.  Well worth it.  Very romantic.  Perfect for a date night or any other sort of gathering.\n",
      "Laurel is no longer a newcomer  but still going strong.  Chef Elmi continues to turn out French inspired dishes that are uber-creative without being over the top.  Yes  the food is post-modern  but not to the extreme  fussed  but not overly so  and the portion sizes are what you'd expect from a 7 course tasting...somewhere between small and medium-small.  Ingredients are fresh beyond compare  presentation is outstanding  service is attentive without being overbearing  and the flavor combinations are unique and work exceedingly well.  The wine list is very small  only a handful of options.  The overall experience at this very small East Passyunk restaurant is outstanding  and worth the trouble in getting a reservation  and paying the $85 pre fixe.  Reservations do appear to be a bit easier than they have been in the past  but don't let that fool you into thinking the food is any less fantastic than it has been.\n",
      "Okay people  this place is worth the hype and the $$$$. After watching Chef Elmi compete on Top Chef like a champ  I knew I had to quickly make a reservation to support my Philadelphia rising star chef's new restaurant. It's a good thing I did  because Laurel is now booked up for basically the next 3-4 months.  My favorite dishes of the night were the scallop crudo (which came with an incredible apple and cucumber consumme)  the roasted shrimp and mushroom soup  the pork with a chestnut puree  and the complex sweet and sour dessert of white chocolate pudding with cocoa nibs and quince. Every single dish we had was thought-provoking and so exciting. I think that was my favorite part. Although we knew what the ingredients of each course were  we still had no idea what to expect when it came to the flavor. Chef Elmi kept us on our toes the entire time.  The restaurant is also BYOB and the pricing is comparable to many restaurants in the city. The portions are also fair and we left feeling satisfied and happy.  I'm sorry to talk it up because you won't be able to get into Laurel anytime soon. This Top Chef winner knows what he is doing!\n",
      "I'm looking at the reviews here  and I can't make sense out of what I'm seeing. Either (i) I don't realize what an unsophisticated rube I am  (ii) people are afraid to give a fancy  high-profile place a low-star review  or (iii) Yelp is a scam and Laurel pays them a bunch of money to keep low-star reviews out. Laurel is  at best  unremarkable  except for the prices  for which Laurel has managed to set a new standard in Philadelphia. Dollar-for-ounce  it's by far the most expensive place in the city.   'Fois gras' always sounds good when it rolls off waitresses' lips  and it tastes even more decadent than it sounds. But when you say it  there should actually be some fois gras in the dish -- at least enough to taste it. All I tasted was the most expensive granola I've ever had  I prefer some of the granola in those containers at Whole Foods.  The one dish I did think was excellent was the gnocchi  which I gather is their famous dish. It was good  but I feel like I'm paying for its fame at an additional $55. I notice other reviews discussing it only months ago for $20  $40  $45. No matter how good it is  I don't think it'll be worth it in a year from now when it's $125.  Many reviewers note the tiny portions. They are  to be sure  miniscule  but I actually don't mind that  so long as the taste is a knockout. Here  we received eight dishes -- one (the gnocchi) was excellent  one (the Burgundy snail dish) was very good  and six literally made us laugh at ourselves for voluntarily being robbed of $300. That's $300 -- at a BYO. Remarkable.\n",
      "Food for the most part was very very good. Small portions of course but many plates. It's about taste so law of diminishing returns applies   no more than 3 bites of each plate.  Service was great. Only thing about the service I found odd. The owner served and explained some of the dishes. He seemed pissed off to be there . Unhappy. You couldn't hear a damn thing out of his mouth that he was explaining. I asked twice still couldn't hear. Neither could my wife and she has bionic hearing.  Good to go for special occasions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I know what all of the hype is about!  I luckily secured a spot for two last Wednesday night after seeing them tweet about cancellations on their twitter page. I booked a reservation at 6:30 on Open Table and then called to confirm the reservation. I wanted to do something special for my boyfriend as his graduation was that Thursday  so it worked out perfectly.   We arrived with champagne and beer  and the hostess immediately took it in the back to chill. We were then seated and our waitress came over  poured us a glass of champagne and described how the menu worked. Not long after  we were served our first course.  Course 1: Uni This dish was a perfect starter course. It was a small bite of food but still was very  very good.  Course 2: Mackerel What made this dish for me was the horseradish ice. It was a perfect balance between the texture of the raw mackerel and the spicy/sweet taste of the green apple. Yum.  Course 3: Escargot As it was escargot week  they of course needed to serve a dish with a focus on snails (which worried me a bit as I am not a huge fan). I was pleasantly surprised! The textures/taste was right on point.   Course 4: Gnocchi The gnocchi was a ricotta base and served with a stinging-nettle sauce. It was perfection.  Course 5: Walu  This fish was impeccably cooked- crisp on the outside and flaky and buttery throughout. It was served with a rhubarb puree that tied the whole thing together.  Course 6: Veal This course was my least favorite. Overall  the veal was very tender and the vegetables were cooked well  but it lacked the special ingredient that I felt was present in the other courses.   Course 7: Caramelized White Chocolate Pudding This was an AMAZING dessert. The pudding had a fantastic texture  and the granola-like topping was the perfect contrast.  The food was amazing  but what really made this place a winner in my book (and worthy of the best restaurant in Philly award) was the service. From start to finish we felt that we were being taken care of and treated as if we were the only customers in the restaurant. I will never forget this experience and I cannot wait to come back!!\n",
      "hands down  the best restaurant in Philly. I've been twice now and both times it was impeccable. Beautiful textures  colors  flavors. Portions are the perfect size and you always leave feeling satisfied but not TOO full. Service is very good and the vibe is not stuffy  which is always appreciated. Affordable too considering how wonderful it is. Menu additions can get pricey  but have been worth it in my opinion.  My only complaint was that we ordered the gnocchi and found a hair in it. This would normally gross me out but I know that this was probably a really rare fluke considering how great this place is.  Everyone in Philly who considers themselves a foodie needs to go to Laurel ASAP\n",
      "Legal Sea Foods has truly gone gonzo for global. I found them in the Philadelphia International Airport while waiting for a flight home. Had about an hour and one half so I sat down for some delicious Yuengling   23oz  icy cold and food. Ordered some Kumamoto oysters  I know they're small  have had them several times before  but these should not have been served. They were actually almost non-existent  period. Very disappointing.   On the bright side  the Fruite De Mare Cesar Salad was phenomenal. Cajun grilled shrimp  mussels both steamed and marinated  clams  grilled calamari  marinated clams  shredded Boston lettuce with a nice balsamic vinaigrette - it was really not a Cesar dressing but this was delicious anyway. The shrimp were large and flavorful  nicely grilled  the seafood was all fresh  even the marinated mussels and clams were excellent. The calamari was tender and charred just right. Lettuce was crisp. Croutons to boot. A complete success and quite a deal at about $15.95. Lesson learned  don't order Kumamoto's out of season in an airport. Otherwise  nice.\n",

      "I won't eat here on my own coin because it ain't cheap  but when on business?!  You better believe it!  It's fantastic!  I'm from Maryland originally and I'm a critic of crab cakes. Most crab cakes don't come close. The crab cake here?  Outstanding!!!  Actually one of the best I've ever had. The scallops and shrimp were grilled to perfection. I chose the lite NE clam Chowder and didn't regret one bite!!  Three Mojitos and finished with a bowl of ice cream and I had a memorable meal. My waitress Jennifer was on her game and super friendly.   Officially Phillies best restaurant and didn't let down the Legal Sea Foods brand by being in an airport terminal. Fantastic. I'm in love.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a nightmare of a miserable day stuck in rainy Philly instead of being in a tropical paradise  dealing with the awful american airlines we really needed some positive. The staff here was really amazing  comped us some soups and helped us find cool things to do and a place to stay overnight. Really above and beyond   they gave me hope we can salavage this trip.  Thanks guys!\n",
      "Quick bite to eat before flight.   Sat at bar  great service.  Had the lunch special of shrimp and avocado!  Lite but good!\n",
      "We had Greek salad  salmon  lobster role  and chicken tenders it was all great. This is a great place to go to if you have dinner in the Philadelphia airport!\n",
      "Actually  I wanted to give Legal Sea Foods at the Philadelphia airport 3+ stars.  The entire airport on a Sunday afternoon was a madhouse.  Legal Sea Foods was noisy  crowded and customers were waiting for a table.  Unfortunately to avoid a wait I chose to sit at a small communal table with backless wooden stools.  Extremely uncomfortable.  I realize airport restaurants are expensive to operate  but everything felt crowded and pushed together.  My back was to the bar and I was frequently bumped by people passing by. It's like the restaurant is committed to making every inch count.  Not a relaxing atmosphere to enjoy a rather pricey dinner.  I lived in Boston for l4 years and was pleased to see scrod on the menu.  It was okay  but not the best by far that I've ever had.  The pale crumbs on the top needed to be browned.  I had to ask for rolls  which were excellent.  The string onion rings were very good as was the polenta.  The meal came out from the kitchen hot and the plate was also hot. The wait for the food to arrive was less than I anticipated after seeing how busy they were.  The server was attentive.  She checked back several times and gave me a to go cup of iced tea to send me on my way.  Looking around  I saw other servers hustling and being attentive to the customers. Considering how busy Legal Sea Foods was  that's pretty impressive.\n",
      "Had a 4 hour layover in Philly due to flight delays. Had a lot of time to kill and Legal had the best Yelp reviews  so I gave it a shot. The service was attentive and very friendly. The seafood was VERY fresh and delicious. I got the NE Clam Chowder  shellfish sampler (2 little necks  3 cherrystones  and 3 oysters all raw). Perfection. I also had the Maryland Crab Cake and a House Salad along with w glasses of Sauvignon Blanc.  Airport restaurant or not  this place has their act together. Stop in if you find yourself on a layover  or delay in Philly  you'll be glad you did.\n",
      "Would you like a dance party with the perfect blend of dance music  hype atmosphere  and strong drinks? Would you like to actually dance with strangers and not be groped?   I loved this place  it really took me by surprise. Some miscellaneous things: individual bathrooms are fairly clean  there is a downstairs area to chill without cover  the cover for the upstairs dance party is $10  bartenders are shirtless (yum)  and its mainly gay men but they are all so sweet. I can't wait to go back.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I appreciate Woody's for being one of the more inclusive spaces for LGBTQ folks in the city (though there are still issues)  I can't get past the horrible DJs. Some of their theme nights have quality music  such as Latin night  but even then  it's likely that the DJ will somehow manage to make it sound like an annoying  tasteless top 40 song.  Come on the weekend and expect to feel like you're in a middle school auditorium. It's borderline offensive that they expect grown adults to enjoy the top 40 garbage remixes they play. The place has no class and no originality.\n",
      "I had a good time here. When I got there around 10:30 on a Saturday night  there wasn't a line but it was a nice crowd inside. The front bar was really crowded so I asked the bouncer if there was a bar in the back. He said yes  you are looking for Rosewood. I was just looking for another bar! However  it was less crowded back there and the DJ was playing some old school hip hop and R&B. It was a good time though. There isn't much of a dance floor but what little space was there people were making the most of. Drinks were $10. A little steep but they were strong.  I would definitely go back when in Philly!\n",
      "As you can probably tell my the number of girls who have written reviews  ladies seem to like Woody's. This leads to LOTS of groups of girls (with maybe one guy with them)  especially upstairs dancing. We paid a 10 dollar cover for upstairs on a Friday only to find a dance floor not very crowded  with mostly women. It got fuller as the night went on  but still probably was more than 50% women on the dance floor. Counting the creepers off to the side who stand and ogle  perhaps it was majority men  but I have a hard time considering the top floor a gay bar.  That said  the top 40/normal gay music was good (if a little too loud)  the staff nice  and drinks average priced.  I did like the lights and fog  too.  We were downstairs earlier in the night and it definitely had the more normal (and pleasant) local but popular gay bar vibe. Not being from Philly  I was shocked by how big all the guys are--why must your arms be the size of babies?! Because of the crowd  it was harder to get drinks and admittedly the bartender was less nice (because he was rushed). The crowd was a little older than what I expected.  Ultimately  I'd give upstairs a 3  downstairs a 4. I'd feel obligated to go back  but with some reservation.\n",
      "Woody's is probably the largest gay bar in Philly: it's got three or four different rooms and gets pretty packed at night (you won't miss it with all the people hanging out on the sidewalk). My boyfriend and I went there both nights that we were in town  and had a pretty good time. Lots of friendly people (though a slightly older crowd than at other places) and relatively cheap drinks: always a good combination. They have computers upstairs with free internet access (which I always find a bit weird in a bar... why would one want to come here to spend time online)  and I was given a friendly reminder by some random dude at the bar not to give in to the temptation to check my email... \\social suicide!\\\"  said he. There's also a dance floor upstairs  though you have to pay to get there on the weekend (wtf?!). Good place to mingle with the locals while getting your drink on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was a little bit inebriated but from what I can remember this was great place to go out! The music was awesome  drinks were strong and cheap  and the crowd was fun. My friends and I went on a Friday night around 11ish and there was no line or cover. The area is nice too with tons of eateries and other bars nearby.\n",

      "This place was soooo unexpectedly delicious!! We had Charred Carrot Hummus  Shabazi Fries  Bean Fattoush  Roasted Cauliflower and the Bean Tagine. Every dish was flavorful  inventive  fresh and amazing!! Kudos to the chef and owner!! Definitely coming back.\n",
      "Diverse and creative drink menu  and excellently spiced dishes (to live up to the name!) What I like best is how versatile this restaurant can be for the guest. You can come in with a group and have a full and delicious meal  or you pop in for a quick drink and snack at the bar. Either way  you can't go wrong with any menu decision (though I was a huge fan of the yogurt appetizer!) Spice Finch is a welcomed addition to the Philly restaurant scene.\n",
      "Had an amazing dinner thanks to our waiter Josh!   Loved the baked cheese  broccoli toubouleh and octopus   The desserts he recommended were amazing : sundae and burnt cream !!  Josh also recommended great wine to pair with our meal!\n",
      "Ate at Spice Finch Friday night. Arrived for a 7PM reservation and was seated immediately in a packed dining room. The space is spectacular and we were offered Dinner and Cocktail menus and promptly ordered The Rulebook  Organized Chaos  and a Rest in Pete's. Awesome. Get us a few more rounds please. It's small plates so we ordered a ton: Shabazi Fries  Croquettes  Roasted Cauliflower  Broccoli Tabouleh  Warm Grain Salad  Little Neck Clams  Samosa  Chili Chicken Kebab  Shakshuka  Salt Baked Eggplant and four sauces - Muhumara  Lemon Yogurt  Garlic Yogurt and Tahina. There was nothing that wasn't fantastic. All was amazing. And the servers were extremely helpful suggesting food pairings and the order for serving.  This is a must go in Philly.\n",
      "We have eaten twice at Spice Finch now  and we love it! The food is delicious  creative  and filling. We had bean tangine (loved it)  roasted cauliflower (best ever)  and petite filet (tender and YUM) for our main course. Our server  Karen  was lovely and attentive. The presentation is exquisite. Nothing is lacking  and the prices are so reasonable. Ambiance is charming  cocktails are great  and the staff is extremely accommodating. This is a new gem on the Philly restaurant scene  and a very welcome one at that.\n",
      "Great food  drinks  and an amazing ambiance!!! Really good service. Definitely recommend for large parties!\n",
      "WOW!!! Incredibly delicious!! We explored many items on the menu and adored everything!! The lamb melted in your mouth as the flavors exploded!  The drinks were interesting and service was timed perfectly.  The restaurant has a wonderful energy.   Our server  Heather was outstanding  friendly and fun. The manager stopped by our table for a delightful conversation. Each employee who poured water or cleaned the table was pleasant and smiling .  Overall a perfect meal!! We can't wait to go back!!\n",

      "Without being accused of \\You just like Jenn and Billy/Billy and Jenn so of course you are giving them 5 stars\\\" - they are getting solid 4 stars. The kind of 4 stars that in a couple of months as they iron out the kinks should move straight to 5. Also  we outsourced the selection of the plates to wonderful servers/kitchen staff.  0. Maybe my standards for size are dropping thanks to the incredible rents NYC restaurants pay but this place is huge. Absolutely positively huge. And it seems it is able to deliver consistent food.  1. Spiced yogurt. This thing is absolutely positively delicious. Take it from someone who spent a lot of time in the Middle East. It is the bomb. Creamy  garlicy and delicious. And fried pita. Oh. My. God. The fried pita. Or maybe it was not even a pita. Get it.   15 out of possible 10 points.  2. Stuffed Grape Leaves - definitely not what I expected. I dont quite know how I feel about it being called \\\"stuffed grape leaves\\\" since one expects a rather specific middle eastern interpretation of what it should be. It was not. It was something else even though true to the form it was stuffed grape laves.  9 out of 10 points. Probably because I cannot get over how it was something else than what I expected based on a name. Still excellent.  3. Dates - yummy. They could even be a desert less sweet dessert if someone did not want to have a traditional middle eastern desert.  9 out of 10.  4. Peri Peri shrimp - I have no words. Just get it.  10 out of 10  5. Broccoli Tabouleh - I may have to reconsider my general antipathy towards broccoli. It was that good.  9 out of 10.  6. Merguez Kebab - absolutely positively delicious. Get it. Get it. And get it.  10 out of 10.   I think we got two more things but I was so full by the time I dont even quite remember what they were -- food coma. They were  however  very well done.\"\n",
      "delicious small plates - and vegetarian friendly.  Went twice in one weekend.  Pita bread is insanely delicious  as are shishito peppers and stuffed grape leaves.\n",
      "Full disclosure  never been here before 2am (and sober).   REGARDLESS  this place is damn good. Four stars because it's cash only  which of course can be inconvenient at times. But with the existence of apps like venmo and square (and they even have an ATM for a fee) problems like that are a quick fix. Bathroom is kinda small as well  but it gets the job done.   The wait is never long to be seated  even if there outwardly appears to be a line outside. Once seated  the staff treats you well and doesn't hesitate to take care of whatever is needed at your table. Yet  they're also not overbearing to the point that you feel rushed (which is crucial obv when you're trying to rehash those late night stories with friends). I always find myself making friends with the waitress  but that could just be my nature who knows.   The food: definitely good portions for a pretty standard breakfast affair. The number of options on the menu is what really stands out. And it sure doesn't take long to get to you. They're really good about fixing something that comes out wrong  and I remember specifically basically getting two whole breakfasts one night because I got the wrong cheese on an omelette. I almost cried I was so happy.   Space is limited at booths so be ready to cram it in if you've got more than 4 ppl together.   It's always a good time when I've gone and I'm looking forward to the next time I go back. Whenever I end up at Lil Pete's...I know it's been a great night.\n",
      "I hope they open their new location somewhere close to Rittenhouse square. So close to me  I know nothing about Philly  Little Pete did show me some comfort time. The owner guy was always at the counter and he was nice. The waitress ladies seemed tough but they were actually very friendly and attentive.   I had couple dishes there since I got my breakfast there couple times.  Loved their greek salad  this was so big that I always had left over and ate later.  Their omelet was pretty good. Fluffy and yum.  The egg sandwich  I liked it very much! They gave you so much egg and it was delicious. My go to breakfast awhile.  Their French fries!!!! Crispy and just perfect with mayo. The waitress ladies remembered me and packed mayo with my fries even I did not ask for.   I like to have this comfy diner right next me. Sad to see them leaving.  We don't have many diners in center city though.\n",
      "I yelped \\brunch\\\" before coming to \\\"Philly\\\" and it guided me to here.  This cute little corner diner restaurant was literally across the street from the hotel that I was staying in.  Came in for breakfast around 10am and was seated immediately. The menu is very straight forward with the basic home-cooked meals. They have specials and deals based on what day you come in. There is a mixture of locals and tourists. We ended up getting the Belgium waffle and the Tuesday special omelet. The special omelet comes with coffee and toast. I think the coffee comes with free refills-I'm not a coffee drinker so didn't pay attention.  Great place and would definitely come again if in Philly!\"\n",
      "Staff was extremely welcoming. Gave off the perfect diner vibes. It was a very cute little place! Food wasn't the best diner food I've had but it was only my first time there and I got chicken fingers. Will definitely be back in the future to try their breakfast! Not a lot of seating inside  but the group I was with had a great time.\n",
      "I hear this place is closing permanently soon. What a shame! The food is awesome  the staff is dedicated and the pricing is fabulously fair. I enjoyed breakfast after clubbing closeby. There were plenty of colorful patrons from different walks of life. I met a federal agent  a limo driver and a medical grad student from Penn...diversity at it's best!\n",

      "I'm not dumb  I know what goes on in any establishment that cooks and serves food  from the shittiest diner to the classiest restaurant. And it doesn't bother me  hey...if it doesn't kill ya  it only makes you stronger. That being said  don't use the bathroom here. It's a glimpse into a world that you just don't want to see.  The food was pretty damn good and the service was reasonable. They didn't even bitch when we had to put a chair at the end of our booth for a 5th person on a really busy lunch hour. Kinda pricey for a \\diner\\\" tho  i guess that has more to do with location than anything.\"\n",
      "Little Pete's is a great spot for late night food after a night out. I think it's kind of cute inside too! It feels like you've gone back in time a bit. It also looked really clean to me  which was surprising. I had a scrapple egg and cheese sandwich and it was absolutely perfect. The waitress was really friendly too.   I arrived there around 1:30 in the morning and we were able to get seats at the counter immediately. By the time we were ready to leave though  there was a line out the door. Definitely keep that in mind if you're hungry :D\n",

My favorite part about Little Pete's - aside from the great  cheap diner food- is going to the restroom. You actually get to walk through the kitchen! Wow!\n",
      "Great option for a healthier take out meal.  I had spinach ravioli with meatballs.  The sauce was awesome.  The service was great.  The atmosphere was just right.  The price  however  was a bit high.   All said  i'd go back.  The Flat bread pizza looked yummy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sauces will keep you coming back for more. The flatbreads are creative and filling. The menu is classic with a flair  and the build-your-own offers up something for everyone. The atmosphere is fun  it's open late  charming customer service  and clean. Delivery? What? Even better. This is a neighborhood spot you need to try.\n",
      "Great food! Very friendly staff.   I am so glad Quick Fixx opened  because I work around the corner and this place is perfect for lunch or grabbing dinner to go on the way home (the area needed something like this). They have pastas  flatbreads  and salads. Everything is fresh and you can even create your own item with any ingredients. I got the gnocchi with spicy tomato sauce and sauteed mushrooms. It was delicious. The side salad I got was arugula with shaved parm cheese. It was great and I really liked the lemon olive oil dressing that is their house dressing (they also have several other good choices). Word of advice: some items may have parsley in the sauce  so if you don't like it have them keep it out. For a pasta dish and side salad I spent $10. Not terribly expensive for lunch  but you can also get a flatbread for $6  so it isn't bad. Very good deal for dinner.   The interior is a cute design too  with little herb pots all around.   I will be back soon - next time I will have to try one of their combinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been twice this week.... they have a $10 lunch menu (includes drink and tax - it's Cash Only on this deal though  FYI) which is a great deal.  Had the grilled chicken ceasar salad the first time and a flatbread with old bay fries (YUM!) today.  Everything is made to order  and I love that they encourage you to build your own  they don't stifle my creativity (read: pickiness).   The service is GREAT  the people are super friendly.  And free wifi to boot.  I'll be back!    PS.  They deliver.  They said their area is 11th to the Schuykill  Walnut to Washington  - but to call because they will try to accommodate more locations if they can.\n",
      "Quick Fixx has been a consistently awesome go-to place for eats in my neighborhood for me even before I moved into the neighborhood. The day I rented my first place in Philly  I stopped in Quick Fixx because I needed just that: quick food  and healthy-ish  if at all possible. With their expansive salad menu prominently displayed on the wall  I quickly made the decision to slowly inhale something before the apartment open house.   I ordered the goat cheese salad  which was delicious and delivered to me in around 10 minutes. Win! [And then I successfully rented my current apartment. Win again!] I remember especially loving the strawberries within the salad  currently replaced by (probably) more season-friendly apple slices  which are also quite nice. This salad has a nice balance of fruit  veggies and a little carbs with tortellini thrown in for good measure. This is the kinda combo that I know makes me feel full for a long time without the sluggishness of consuming a heavy meal  so it's kinda become my perfect option for lunch.   Having just lovingly described my usual order  yesterday  I stopped into Quick Fixx and tried something outside of my usual  which was the arugula salad and the pierogis: yum! This is a more simple salad consisting of arugula  parm cheese  and dressing  but the dressing used for the arugula is kinda special: it's savory and lemon-y and just lovely. As an unofficial pierogi expert (qualifications: Central PA native  kinda Polish)  these were great! They were fried in a way that felt lighter than I've tried elsewhere and had a nice amount of filling. The filling itself was pretty standard  but good. I'd be interested in trying the jalapeño pierogis someday.   I am thankful to have this wonderful little spot on the edge of Rittenhouse that offers year-round freshness!\n",
      "Free wifi and a pretty good lunch for under $15 in Rittenhouse. i really cant complain about anything other that the fact that they dont give you bread with your salad   Really ?!? other than that service was fine and my salad was pretty darn tasty.\n",
      "My husband and I have already eaten here twice...both times were such a treat! We sampled a few of their flatbreads: the Fixx  the Prosciutto and the Lancaster  PA. We highly recommend the Mushroom & Speck bruschetta and the all-star dish of the night  the Gnocchi Lasagna. My husband loved the Fixx so much on our first visit  he ordered it again.   The ingredients are definitely fresh and the presentation is amazing for the affordable price point. I am glad to see so many positive reviews for The QUICK FIXX  because we hope this place sticks around. Looking forward to going back again!\n",
      "I have nothing positive things to say.  First and foremost  they use Bounty Paper Towels Select a Size as their napkins. Huge fan of that Huge fan. #pgemp  Alert -- Your food is not going to immediately come out of the kitchen. But that's why this is the quick fixx... not fazoils or mcdonalds. They clearly are making your items to order and not just making a ton of it and reheating it. It's still pretty quick considering.  I have had a few things on their menu and they are all excellent. It is a perfect place when you have a few minutes before your next activity and need a quick dinner. And furthermore... it's quick skip and jump away from my place.  The service and the people working there are very nice. And they keep the place immaculately clean. Can't say the same thing about the other places in the South Street area.  Overall... When I am in need of a QUICK meal... I'll be back... They do deliver  but I feel that is SO lazy when I am so close to walk.  This review was brought to you by the word  \\QUICK\\\"\"\n",
      "My family and I visited the day after Thanksgiving. We easily got reservations and honestly could have just walked in with no reservations. There were only about 4 other tables filled. The first thing I noticed was the wine bar. This place is a must for any and all wine lovers. Our group ranged in age from 14 to 68.  Two ordered the filet mignon. They were both cooked to perfection.  The other three of our group selected the special for that night that included gnocchi  ravioli and one other type of pasta. This dish was offered as a whole or half. Everyone ordered half and it was just enough if you were planning on dessert  which you should. We each ordered a different dessert. The tiramisu was wonderful as were the pear and the apple desserts. Service was great and I would go again the next time I'm in town.\n",
      "Ristorante Panorama is a little bit of a throwback - the ambiance is wonderful and you do not feel rushed to start  or complete your meal. The waitstaff is well trained and are quite familiar with the menu.   We started our meal with a wonderful antipasto platter which easily served the four of us - very nice presentation. The ladies brought their wine flights from the bar (they have a system that provides 150 different wines by the glass) while Charlie and I sampled their selection of Craft beers on tap.  Entrees consisted of:  Gnocchi con Provola Affumicata homemade pillows of potato and ricotta gnocchi with fresh basil and fresh & smoked mozzarella  in a light San Marzano tomato sauce  Vitello Mandolese thinly pounded veal medallions stuffed with prosciutto and fresh mozzarella in a sauce of porcini mushrooms  Orecchiette housemade pasta (two).  We finished off this perfect meal by sharing two orders of excellent cheesecake.\n",
      "This place is incredible. Impressive wine selection  great ambiance  and impeccable service. The meatball is a must. Will make it a point to go back every time I'm in Philly.\n",
      "If I had intended on doing more of a wine tasting visit to Ristorante Panorama  this may be a 4. There's a very extensive list of wines and I enjoyed my Sangiovese. My sister in law and I ate here (had baby and stroller in tow) for dinner on a week night. Be warned there is no ramp if you need one! The restaurant itself is in a really cool hotel historic building. It's very cozy and romantic. Food is okay. If the price point was a little lower  I might be more impressed  but for the price- Shrug. They also have a gluten free pasta  but only one option  with a few possible sauce substitutions  and my sister in law felt it was just okay. Staff was nice and helpful with getting the stroller in and out. I'd say  maybe not the best bang for your buck in terms of Italian  but would be a great spot for friends and wine.\n",
      "Ok  so those of you who know me know that I am an absolute wine geek...so coming to Panorama  with their 120-glass list  was a dream come true.  Well  it should have been.    The wines by the flight are really nice.  I did the big and bold flight that had 5 glasses (1.5 oz pours) of mostly expensive italian wines (barolo  brunello  amarone  a priorat and a cabernet).  I think it was $55.  Not bad and the wines were each really nice.    That's pretty much where the greatness stopped.  We also had a bottle of 1996 Pio Cesare barolo (~$70 retail if you can find it...$175 on the list).  That was a decent bottle at an outrageous mark up.    The food...left much to be desired.  The meats were all overcooked.  The sides were uninspired and the pastas we tried were average (to slightly above average compared to other Italian places in the city).    I'd go back for wine but not food.\n",
      "Very delicious  well executed food. Pleasant but old school dining room. Had the homemade burrata  roast pork ravioli  egg yolk and truffle raviolo  chicken  profiteroles. Wine flights were hit (Killer B's) or miss (Piemontese Power). Service was great. Music was terrible (like hotel lobby elevator bathroom music)\n",
      "Reservations for a birthday dinner with friends.  The restaurant is very nice  cozy  and festive.  The wine selection is amazing  the have a world record for wine on tap.  Service was also very good.  I had the rigatoni and my husband had a lamb pasta dish.  The rigatoni had some weird scoop of something that looked like creamy liver on it.  The sauce tasted slightly burnt  and my pasta was undercooked.  My husband's lamb dish was underwhelming.  The other couple with us enjoyed their dishes.  The cheese plate appetizer was delicious.  Disappointing overall.\n",
      "I went here with a friend and we had a great time. We went on a Friday during happy hour and stayed for quite a while. The restaurant has a very warm and inviting feeling  everything I'd previously heard about it...we weren't disappointed.  The wine selection is off the charts! Everything we had from the wine  to cocktails  to food was delicious. We will be back soon...\n",
      "\n",
      "Love them for restaurant week. It leaves more room in my budget for the wine. I am a big fan of the big and bold flight  which comes in around $55.  You can't go wrong with any of the fresh pastas. My favorite is the triangolini (I know that's not spelled right  but is the small triangle ones.) Its one of the few times that the pasta out shined the other ingredients in the dish.\n",
      "Not that good but the beer is ok. We tried the grilled corned beef Rueben which was unremarkable and served on soggy bread. My upgrade of sweet potato fries was a bad idea. The fries were cooked in the same fryer as the fish they serve and remnants of beer batter were throughout the dish-uggghhh. We also shared a Thai chicken lettuce wrap dish. It was full of sugar and served on wilted lettuce. I asked the waitress if indeed the fries were cooked in the same fryer as the fish. She asked the kitchen and confirmed that it was so. It was not a place I would return to even though this was our second visit. The first visit was ok  not great  but ok.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not one to give out a perfect score because I can always find something to complain about  however  this place is damn near perfect.   Where to start?  Service: party of two arrived Saturday night around 8:20 pm without a reservation. We were told it was going to be a wait of 40 minutes. We were going to go to the bar area but it was crowded so we just sat by the waiting area. After about twenty minutes  a woman named Megan came over and asked our name again and said we will be seated shortly. She then asked if we wanted to try the pumpkin ale. We declined then she offered chips and guacamole on the house. We were surprised because it wasn't 40 minutes yet but we kindly accepted regardless of the reason. Our waitress Melissa (I'm almost sure this was her name. If not I apologize profusely) was attentive and friendly. She came back often to make sure we were okay.  I had told Megan that she made my friend's day by offering the chips and guacamole because it was her birthday. When we were seated  Melissa wished my friend happy birthday and offered ice cream for dessert. Clearly  communication among the staff is great.  The food: Chips and guacamole 4/5: good texture. Fresh. Chips were okay. Guacamole needed a little salt.   Seafood bisque soup: I didn't try this but my friend enjoyed it.  House salad 4/5: very good. Could have been a little more crisper. Probably would get the dressing on the side next time. Delicious none the less  Korean BBQ wings 4/5: I ordered the small portion and these big wings came out. I was impressed by the size of the wings. The wings were a bit more spicier than I thought they would be but still a good taste.   Crab cakes: I didn't taste this but my friend said they were delicious. I did taste the old Bay fries that came with them 4/5. They were thick and nicely seasoned. Could have been a bit crispier for me  I ordered the local hand crafted vodka and it was very good.   I would definitely return. We were full after the chips  salad and soup. We took majority of our food home but we can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow!!  Service is everything to me and this establishment should teach a lesson to other places.  When I'm back in Philly  I'll definitely be returning!\n",
      "\n",
      "The service here was terrible  the food was ok but not good enough to make up for the extremely long wait and inattentive staff. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone and I won't be returning.\n",
      "Thankfully Yelp has the hours wrong on this new place to the neighbourhood. It's actually open from 11:30 to Midnight  not Noon. We have walked past it the last three days while wandering around Philadelphia during our visit. We decided to give it a go on our last evening here looking for some small plates as opposed to a big meal.   It's a beautiful in house craft brewery which is very popular in our neck of the woods so we are quite familiar with the concept. Beer is not our thing so we will leave those that know way more about that to comment on the offering of suds that their offering.   We can tell you that the pretzel sticks are great and the cheese dip was also excellent although could use a little infusion of sharp cheese to make it outstanding. The grainy mustard dip to us was a touch to heavy on the acid and could have used a bit of sweetness to cut the acidity.   The Caesar salad was good with a generous amount of food even with the starter salad which we split. The croutons were tasty and the Parmesan cheese plentiful. I like a bit more anchovy than was evident  but others I know do not  so I am likely in the minority there.   Where the fifth star was earned were the buffalo wings which were HUGE! The appetizer wings are $13.00 and include 10 wings or so our server told us. We got 11 and it might be because they were on the light side as far as weight goes (kidding  check out the photo). They were very tasty and there was no way the lovely K and I could finish them. Suffice it to say we have lunch already for tomorrow as we brought 6 back to our hotel room.   The place was rocking busy  but even at that the food came out quickly and the service was very good. They haven't been open for long which typically results in glitches to either the food  or the service and we experienced neither.   Definitely a place to check out!\n",
      "I have been here five times since they opened and never been disappointed.  The beer is amazing and constantly being updated.  I recommend joint their King of the Hill club as you get larger beers for the same price as a pint.  The highlight for me are the Philly Cheese egg rolls and the nachos.  Both are amazing.  Also the BRueben is excellent.  All the IPA's are great.  Also  lots of TV's for sports and you can make a reservation on Open Table.\n",
      "I love this place!  The service is always great  and the food is decent as well.  This was a great addition to the convention center area!  I've been to Iron Hill a number of times since they opened and the service is always great.  I recently had an issue with a charge  and the manager  Laura  handled it excellently.  I've always had good service  but one server who has stood out has been Jacob Maher.  He was very pleasant and helpful to my non-beer-drinking girlfriends.\n",
      "Wow!   Can I go 6 stars?   Great atmosphere  great location (ok I was staying at the Marriott!).  I sat at the bar and had the most delightful bartender - Ashley.      She recommended the Ore House IPA and it did not disappoint.  I lived in San Diego for 10 years and had access to all kinds of great IPA's.   This is not going to knock you over on the hops  but the flavor and the hops find a great balance.  Ashley's next brilliant suggestions were to go with the Nashville Hot Chicken Sliders and the Brussels sprouts to compliment my beer.   Amazing!   Both were excellent but the sliders are a MUST (imho).  A great balance of heat and savory between the fried chicken  pickles  mayo  and a great bun.     Go!  Eat  drink  be merry !\n",
      "Iron Hill Brewery is a brewery before it's a restaurant. So while the beer and drink menus are extensive and interesting  the food menu  not so much. (Agreeing with my fellow Yelper Kat C.  the food is definitely on the mediocre side.) Maybe some good rich or fried bar snacks to go with the beer  which  again  pretty standard for a brewery.  If  on the other hand  you are sensitive to fried foods  or you are a vegetarian  you probably won't find much here that you'll be able to enjoy. So why would I  falling into both categories  ever do dinner here? Because I had a work dinner to celebrate one of my colleagues. And not just is she one of my colleagues  but she's a colleague that I happen to like very much. What we do for work and for love.  The ambiance was typical for a brewery on  Thursday night  bustling and moderately loud. Not so loud I couldn't hear the people at my table  and I even caught some of the music on the restaurant loudspeakers (random but great selection). All we ordered were drinks and appetizers (SO MANY DRINKS)  so I'll do a quick run-down on the few things I was actually able to eat:  Hand-Cut Sweet Potato Fries: I should not even have had the single fry I ate. But it's hard for me to say no to sweet potato fries  especially when they're impossible to do wrong  so you can always count on them to be good.  Margherita Flatbread: Nope. Thick mozarella slices (was that REALLY fresh mozarella?) over too-sweet tomato sauce  barely any basil  and slightly soggy pita-esque bread. It's obvious I was disappointed  right?  Nachos: Another one that's hard to mess up  and IHB did not. The beans  vegetables and sour cream were all good  and plenty of yummy guacamole too.  Fried Brussels Sprouts: Another item that I should not have eaten  but probably my favorite of everything I ate. Crisp and well-seasoned  just really tasty overall. Almost worth the stomach ache I've still got after eating three pieces.  Housemade Soft Pretzel Sticks: I don't know what the fuss over these is about. With all the great reviews  this was the item I was most looking forward to. But while the cheese and mustard sauces were good  the pretzels I just wasn't into. They were kind of buttery  Amish style  which I know is popular  but I just can't get into it. And \\everything spice\\\" is for bagels  not pretzels! I feel like it's not just me either  because my table of 7 barely managed to finish the 5 sticks that came in the order.  We ordered a lot of carnivore-friendly and other fried appetizers too  but since I didn't try those  I won't mention them here. Given the space and the location  the prices are what you'd expect. But for the quality? Maybe next time I'd do happy hour here and get dinner somewhere else (at least  if I have a say in the matter).\"\n",
      "After being recommended here from a friend and remembering that Chef Jason was a Top Chef veteran  I had really high hopes for the place but unfortunately  I was really let down.  I managed to score a date with my girlfriend on a Saturday for our 1 year anniversary and hoped that the supposed excellent food would elevate the evening but while the concepts of the dishes are imaginative with a touch of whimsy  the execution falls really flat.  My 4 Course Tasting (Plus Extras)  Starter Cheese Plate (Share with GF): Nice starter with 3 different types of cheese and accompaniments.  Whipped Foie Gras: This is where the problems start. Though the texture of the foie was honestly divine  pairing this with peanuts made the dish way too salty to thoroughly enjoy. The balance between sweet and salty was not even close which is a criticism that followed through the whole evening.  Scallop Noodles: The dish I was most looking forward to all night from Top Chef fame. Though the dish sounds gimmicky  the texture of the noodles and the flavor they impart really adds to the dish but like the Foie  the broth was beyond salty (almost too much to finish it) and the smoked hoison turned out to be way more sour then anything else.  Cobia: Overall this dish was the best of the night simply because it wasn't super super salty (though by no means a perfect dish). Overall though  the fish was a bit on the dry side and the black truffle fummete sauce was a bit too lemony and had to be left alone in order to enjoy the rest of the meal.  Cookie Dough: Honestly the biggest letdown of the night. I understand the whole sweet/salty vibe that they were trying to get to and I loved the gooeyness of the dish but the chef honestly forgot to put any sugar into my cookie and all I tasted was a big bite of salt. I tried mixing it with the ice cream and the meringue hoping it would cut the salt action but to no effect.   On the plus side  the Saviougn Blanc was really delicious and a steal at under $25 due to Philly wine week. In addition  the sizes of the tasting menu were quite generous (probably 30% bigger then most restaurants) and under no circumstances did I leave the meal hungry.  When you pay close to $100 per person on a special meal for a special occasion  having this many fundamental errors of having a way too heavy hand with the salt is really inexcusable and a big letdown.\n",
      "I wish I hadn't waited so long after my visit here to write my review because I actually can't recall exactly what I had! I just know it was damn good. High quality  skilled cooking. Service was great  decor was relaxing and peaceful. Drink menu varied  albeit a wee bit pricey. But this place is definitely worth going out of your way to visit.\n",
      "Been there several times and only been disappointed once -- by fois gras. That  most likely  was an unrealistic expectation from reading too much. Especially appreciate the menu structure pricing  as well as the bread and water bottle.\n",
      "Went for a friend's birthday dinner  and start off with a drink at the bar while I was waiting for them. The drink I had (forgot the name) - consisted of smoked strawberries - sounded cool  but actually just made my cocktail taste like bacon. Things that taste like bacon are usually a great thing  but drinking it isn't always the most appetizing option.   Starting with the bread that they served  I could tell that the meal was going to be spectacular. it was delicious  and set some high expectations for the rest of the meal.  Dinner was great. Lots of wine  lots of food. We ordered a few different appetizers for the table  some of the star players being the fried Vietnamese buns. I think they were filled with magic  they were so yummy. For my entree  I ordered the skate - perfectly seasoned  delicious  and made me feel like I wasn't wasting my time or money.   Dessert was also delicious  and they brought out a special treat for my friend's birthday. Waiter was super attentive and catered to our needs. Will definitely be returning for more dinners - apparently their brunch is also on point!\n",
      "this was our first time here and was outstanding ! first the staff was very friendly  our waitress was very nice as well and very helpful and answered all the questions about the menu. For me the perfect start  is the bread it sets the tone for the rest of the meal and the bread was great and the oil they served with it was smoked and was out of this world had 3 serving of it. We had the 'tasting of 4' both of us first 'roasted beet tartare' was good  'whipped foir-gras' good also  'baby spanish octopus' very tender liked it a lot  one of the reasons I came here  'diver scallops' they were good but not as good as the waitress raved about them. 'rowhan duck' was good but a little on the small side for a portion and luke warm. ''pulled short rib' was good also about the same portion as the duck  each dish needed more time in the oven for heat enstead of looking pretty! save that for the pictures in the magazines. For dessert 'chocolate ganache' liked it   'Banana Brulee' this was the biggest disapointment of the dinner  was not good and not at all what we expected ! it just didnt do it for us at all  over all I would go again and would highly recommend getting the 'tasting for 4 or 5' if your looking for place that has over sized portions dont go here  but if you want good food and food that tasted good than try it out  its a cool restaurant and are doing a great job\n",
      "Loved this dinner. My boyfriend and I had the four course tasting menu for $59 each I believe - essentially picking one thing from each \\bites\\\" column and a dessert - plus unlike most tasting menus (and unlike their 6 course one) we didn't have to have the same dishes - a plus so we could try more things!  I had the potato leek soup  scallops  duck confit  and the cookie dough. My boyfriend had the beets  duck hearts  monkfish  and passion fruit tart. All were absolutely wonderful  complex combinations but well balanced  etc. My sole critique was that my cookie dough dessert (a nice combo of hot cookie and cold ice cream) was so hot that my ice cream was almost soup by the time I could eat it as opposed to just nice and melty. They should let it cool a bit before adding the ice cream.  Cocktails were innovative and really tasty  Service was fantastic  noise level and ambiance was lovely (happy and lively but bit too loud  intimate lighting and candles but not too dark). Very warm and inviting and we loved our evening. Will be back with friends in tow!\"\n",
      "Let me start by saying if you like well-cooked  flavorful and sometimes daring food  and or kick-ass cocktails you have to go to Ela. That said  if you're a huge eater  the portions are small and the prices a bit high considering  so you'll spend a decent amount to be satiated. Those things in perspective  I still urge daters  friends  family and anyone looking for a cute  neighborhood spot to go to Ela now. A group of four  we got one app (the celery soup  which was amazing)  every \\second\\\" dish (the octopus seemed to be the table's hands down fave  but the gnocci and fois gras were close)  and two entrees--the duck  which is a chef's feed pick  but we weren't bowled over by  and the short ribs  which was an interesting presentation of a \\\"log\\\" of short rib  for lack of a better description  which was tough on the outside  but still tender and flavorful on the inside. We all loved our cocktails. The names are great and combos are interesting but work deliciously. The one with whiskey and passion fruit was especially interesting. Service was good  the place was hot as hell  and the desserts also tasty. Saw the brunch menu which looks amazing and for which we'll be back.\"\n",
      "A group of 7 of us were able to get a reservation here on a Saturday night at 8:30  however we weren't seated until closer to 9:30.   We decided to do a a mix of the 4 course and 5 course samplers between the 7 of us. I was able to try: japanese bass crudo (delicious  ask for a spoon to finish the ponzu)  baby spanish octopus (octopus was grilled perfectly  wasn't a huge fan of the tomato concentrate or sweet and sour eggplant) and the trout (decent but not overwhelmingly memorable). Other items I sampled at the table: general tso's duck hearts (would order these again)  whipped foie gras (well done  the gingerbread is an excellent complement)  green asparagus (crispy and savory)  diver scallop \\noodles\\\" (a \\\"fun\\\" take on scallops  but i do love a good seared scalloped instead)  pulled beef short rib (tasty  but not the most succulent I've had. Wasn't a fan of the steel cut oats pairing) and lamb neck roast.  For desserts we got a mix of items: soft chocolate (i'd say best pick on the menu  delicious soft chocolate balls with blood orange whip)  cheese cake (tasted like tofu  hardly finished these at our table. The crispy puffs also didn't fit well on the plate) and the cookie dough (tasted like a chocolate souffle) and the espresso martini (do not drink if you actually enjoy coffee/espresso).  We had a fun dining experience and I'd say I would definitely like to sample a few other items on the menu or come back for brunch. The space is modern and contemporary and the cocktail list also looks innovative. It's worth a venture down to check out.\"\n",
      "Yummy food  fast and courteous service! Parking is a nightmare  I suggest parking a couple of blocks away in the fabric district\n",
      "One thing: After spending over $300 the staff had the audacity to ask us to leave our table and drink the remainder of our beverages at the bar. We were at our table for 1.5 hours  be respectful Ela.  Was very excited to try Ela during one of my alumni group's monthly brunch club outings  - extremely disappointed with the food. The restaurant itself is a nice space and the service was decent but the food was bland and my entree  along with a few others in my party  came out stark cold. I ordered the short rib eggs benedict and had to send it back because of the temperature. In the meantime  I tried a friend's burger which was very flavorful and cooked to the correct temperature ordered  though the fries were stone cold. When the waitress returned with my \\newly\\\" prepared benedict  much to my disbelief  it was stone cold. At this point I recognized that the temperature error of my dish was not going to be rectified and I dealt with eating a cold short rib egg benedict (which is highly not recommended).  The plus? My Vietnamese Coffee with bourbon was excellent and exactly what I needed  caffeine and bourbon  to get through the brunch unscathed by my entree experience.\"\n",
      "out of ten -- ten being best  food: 7.8  lighting: 10  noise: 10  environment: 8.5  staff: 9\n",

      "Love the ambiance and the food was delicious! I have never had Korean food before and this was a terrific introduction! The Koreancini (fried rice and corn balls) were crisp and sweet and salted to perfection. The Kale Salad was big but not overwhelming and the dressing is perfection. We also got the stone pot bibimbap with tofu. The tofu was expertly cooked and the entire dolsat was flavorful but not too spicy. The relish on the BBQ tofu tacos was pickled heaven.   The white and red sangria were both excellent as well. My friend doesn't even like white sangria and she loved mine. There were also beers  wine  and cocktails that we still have yet to try!  Cannot wait to return!\n",

      "I had been wanting to try this place for a while  ever since I passed by it one day. Fast forward to Sunday  we were looking for a quick place to grab brunch and I suggested we try Southgate. We were able to find street parking nearby for free . When we got inside we were immediately seated and were able to identify several menu items that looked really yummy  the prices were all pretty decent (a meal and a mimosa will run you about $20). When the food came out everything tasted great (the fries are AMAZING). And last but certainly not least  our server Dan was super attentive and helpful. Overall it's a nice option for a casual weekend brunch if you're not trying to do a boozy brunch but still want a little booze.\n",
      "I came here with a friend after it was named the Best Burger from Best of Philly. We both had the Bulgogi burger with fries  and while it was pretty great  I wouldn't say it was the best I've had in Philly (that would be a tie between Kensington Quarters  P'unk Burger  and Good Dog Bar). The service and ambiance were lovely  and I would definitely return.\n",
      "I really enjoyed the bibimbap (got the one with tofu)  it came in a hot bowl. There is outside seating which is nice but I would probably sit inside the next time.\n",
      "This place.   The service was good - BUT the food- Ordered all kinds of menu items.  Kimchee   small plate  salmon crudo  buns   chicken karage   fried rice   As I was digging thru my plate for nourishment   looking for anything flavourful -i felt eyes burning on the back of my neck.  It was the cook looking like a dog groomer peaking thru the kitchen \\window\\\"-----noticing our lackluster expressions.   Over view  - Kim cheeee was old AF - Buns oversteamed - Chicken karage over cooked \\\"chicken fried chicken jerky\\\" - No water options : just sink water  - Basic.   We paid before we got the rice- yelling as we ran out-  Keep the rice.\"\n",
      "The drinks were good  not amazing but good. The Korean fried chicken was flavorful and extra crunchy which I enjoyed. BUT the pork belly udon noodles were seriously awful. I am not at all a picky eater and will pretty much eat anything  but I could barely get any of it down. I felt queasy the rest of the night just thinking about them. Probably won't be back.\n",
      "An awesome addition to the neighborhood. Love the seating outside .. but more importantly  love the bibimbap (especially in the stone bowl). I've been a few times now  and I just can't bring myself to order anything else!\n",
      "Traveling in Philly on my own and wandering around the city center  looking for dinner.  Tons of trendy places but I noticed this sleepy Lebanese restaurant and decided to give it a try.  Very good decision.  I ordered the Baba Ghanoush  Shisk Kebab and Baklava.  Everything was superb.  I can be a tough reviewer but they really hit the mark across the board.  The shish kebab  in particular  was really tender and nicely flavored. The rice was nicely flavored and the vegetable on the plate freshly cooked for the order.  They also served a traditional whipped garlic on the plate which added a bit of zest.  They brought some additional hot sauce at my request but it wasn't really needed.  In any event  if you're local and have never made it inside or a tourist like myself  it's a solid meal at a very reasonable price.  Just to show this is balanced  the atmosphere is ok but deserves a little updating.  But if you're judging on food alone  I'd give this place 5 stars.\n",
      "I went here with a large group and had a great time. The food was fantastic and reasonably priced. I had the falafel and hummus platter  which was delicious. It came with a very fresh salad and side of pita bread for dipping. The rest of the group ordered a variety of dishes that were equally as satisfying.  The service was decent and could have been a little better. We had to flag down the servers to get a refill on drinks  and it took a while to get our check. Otherwise  great place! I'll definitely be back.\n",
      "Came here for an impromptu dinner on a Saturday night with 4 other people. We were luckily seated within less than 5 min but were told that you need to make a reservation for 5+ people. Service was a little slow because it was busy  we had to ask to be served water and to be given utensils. However  our waiter was extremely kind and welcoming.   I've come here a couple of times before and enjoyed my food every time. The platters are very filling and cheap ($12-$14 on average). This time I ordered the falafel Baba sandwich (falafel  eggplant  tomatoes  lettuce & tzaziki sauce). I made it Lebanese style (pickles & French fries) for $0.50 extra  but without the pickles. This was filling and delicious! The french fried in the sandwich were actually sliced potatoes and not french fries  but it still tasted good.   I like that this restaurant has vegetarian options on the menu. There's three variations of the falafel sandwiches on the menu  a falafel platter  and a mixed veggies platter. Definitely coming back soon!\n",
      "This is a great restaurant with delicious and fairly priced food. The portions are filling  and they have a good number of vegetarian and vegan options. I had the falafel sandwich and it was  a m a z i n g. This sandwich is vegan - the only sauce they use on it is tahini sauce (which is really flavorful). The sauce looks creamy  kind of like yogurt based sauce  but there is no dairy in it. I'll definitely be visiting when I'm back in the area!\n",
      "I'm not really sure where to even start because there were so many good points about Sahara Grill but let's begin by stating that their food is really delicious. Their hummus with ground lamb and pine nuts is AMAZING! The bowl was wiped clean with pita bread  it was that good.   For an entree I ordered the mixed grill because I really wanted to try everything and everything was fantastic. One thing I need to point out especially is that I appreciate that they didn't hold back on seasoning/spices. At least here in Orlando  the majority of the Lebanese places offer bland food that cater to the American palette  why? Why hold back on making something truly stand out? The people here at Sahara understand this  and the food shines because of it.  They are BYOB  enough said.  The waiter/waitress were so attentive and kind  they really made us feel welcome.  The prices are awesome  especially when you consider how much food you're getting  and when you compare to what other restaurants on Walnut street charge per plate.   I would absolutely make it a point to eat here if I'm ever in Philly again  it was truly a great dining experience.\n",
      "We were in the Arts district and looking for dinner. Yelp to the rescue. Because of the area - there are many a steakhouse and other pricey options in this neighborhood. We wanted something a little more casual and not so expensive.  Sahara totally did the trick. It's a pretty small place  but I knew from the moment we walked it we were in a good location as there was a large group of middle eastern teenagers just hanging out. Another group came in while we were eating.  It says \\home cooking\\\" on their sign and I believe it - the food was absolutely delicious  and probably the most authentic I have had. The hummus was so good  very smokey. I got chicken and couscous and it was so yummy!   Decor wise it was average - totally acceptable but nothing to write home about. Only four stars because the service was a little slow  and inattentive. They never asked us how the food was - not once  not even a the end of the meal. So four starts. We would definitely go back!\"\n",
      "In some sense  you'd love your experience at a restaurant to be memorable. Great  hospital service  excellent food  interesting ambiance  and so on. On the other hand  you don't want it to be memorable. Intrusive service  lingering tastes  overpriced food  and unclean environment.  Well  I don't remember much at Sahara Grill. Even though I went there yesterday for lunch. Maybe it's because I grew up around cuisine like Sahara Grill's. Mediterranean  Middle Eastern  and specifically Egyptian. My shawarma was normal. I gobbled it up pretty fast and enjoyed it. But it wasn't mind-blowing--nor was it so horrible I could never forget it. Too much pita  not enough beef  but enough fresh veggies  cumin  and tahini sauce to make it worth my while.  I do remember the fact that it cost $7--when it should be 4. C'est la vie in Center City.\n",
      "I went to Sahara Grill last week and was less than impressed.  They were out of the Shawarma we ordered but the mixed grilled plate we ended up with was pretty good.  The pitas were definitely the low point--not heated up or prepared in any way.  I can get dry  cold pitas to go with my hummus at Superfresh  thanks.\n",
      "So let me start by saying how much I love their food. The owners and employees have always been friendly. They always remember me by name  and know who I am by my telephone order.  Recently they added Chicken Shawarma to their menu  which I absolutely love. I always check to see if its available  and when it is  I order it. I also love their Lamb Couscous.  I always order takeout  and they've never once made me wait longer than they said on the phone. That is a rare and very respectable norm.\n",
      "This is an economical but very tasty middle eastern restaurant. The food is authentic and the waitstaff is extremely friendly.  We ordered the Combo appetizer (baba ganoush  olives  hummus  feta  marinated eggplant  carrots  etc.) for the table. Everything was great  but the baba ganoush was exceptional  by baba ganoush standards.   The Kafta Kabob  Falafal Hummus and Shawarma (lamb) were superb.   The only reason this didn't get a 5 star is that the waitstaff and kitchen were so enthusiastic that they delivered everything all at once. They didn't give us time to get through the Combo platter before the table was overflowing with plates and it felt too rushed.   The owner (or at least he acted that way) was attentive the whole time and came over to talk to us at the end about how the couscous from Algeria is different than the couscous from Morocco.  This isn't high end dining  but it's very good value and you'll leave feeling quite satisfied\n",
      "They only had one cook and one cashier manning the entire place when I was there so it took awhile for orders to be processed and made even with only a couple other people there waiting.  Otherwise  taste and quality is about equal to to other Federal Donuts...  Come here for their cake donuts (versus the traditional yeast donuts that you eat at Dunkin Donuts  Krispy Kreme  ect.)  which are more substantive and full in texture versus your typical fluffy yeast donut.  Unfortunately  Federal Donuts does overprice their donuts in general  i.e. I could get 6 yeast donuts versus 2 Federal Donuts.    Recommend their Cinnamon and Sugar donut if its your first time trying one.  In regards to their chicken  sometimes it is too dry  sometimes the sauce is too much - it all depends on the cook/chef making them.  Otherwise  just another Federal Donuts if you are into the franchise!\n",
      "Who doesn't like freshly made donuts?  If your only experience with donuts is at your typical donut shop like Dunkin'  then you have to give this place a try. Their flavored  \\just made\\\" donuts are awesome. I had the Strawberry Lavender and thought it was delicious!  The staff was also super nice and polite. I will definitely be back here next time I visit Philadelphia.\"\n",
      "Their chicken is the best. I love their fried chicken wings (either plain or with the soy glaze) and am looking forward to trying their sandwich.   I think I prefer the chicken to their donuts  which are good but sometimes pretty oily. I'm a fan of the regular sugar donuts   particularly the cinnamon and vanilla (the fancy ones aren't bad or anything  but I don't particularly love them).  I'm still on the hunt for a normal (cheaper) neighborhood donut shop  but until I find one I'll keep coming here.\n",
      "Goodbye dieting Hello happiness  Get the sea salt chocolate donut.  I think most everything has been said about this establishment. It is great. I have to resist and make this a Friday morning thing now.   Their chicken can be skipped. It is good but the donuts are what make this place great  not the chicken \n",
      "I attend Penn Law and Federal Donuts has been my saving grace. I honestly go every day to get a donut  coffee  or a combination of the two. The specialty and hot and fresh donuts never disappoint. My favorite has been the Great Pumpkin  but that is unfortunately just seasonal. But I am very much looking forward to fall to have it again! The staff is also extremely friendly and honestly just helps brighten my day. This is one of the first places I take any visitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I walked in here I was expecting a coffee shop with muffins  maybe crescents  in addition to donuts. I was slightly disappointed walking in when I only saw donuts. I'm not a big donut fan. I usually can never eat a whole one b c I usually find it to be too \\heavy\\\". I ended up choosing dark chocolate  which is simply a chocolate covered donut. I have to say  it was surprisingly the best donut I ever had! It wasn't heavy at all and the actual donut  not just the chocolate  was very tasty! I was pleasantly surprised. They also serve fried chicken  which I will definitely have to check out while I'm in town.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After hearing a lot about this place I finally decided on checking out Federal Donuts. The donuts were freshly made on spot so they were really soft and warm they tasted great however they were a little too sweet for me. I tried the brown sugar  strawberry  Oreo favor donuts'. Def worth a try if you have sweet tooth!\n",
      "Fried Chicken Swag.  The Good: Light  fluffy  melt-in-your mouth doughnuts! Their fried chicken is tender and juicy. The golden skin is lightly breaded  not doing the sidestroke in grease like most fried chicken. The staff here is friendly and helpful  too.  The Bad: The honey doughnuts aren't always hot  and they have a hint of tartness I find strangely off-putting. The chicken rubs are tasty  but they seem like somewhat of an afterthought -- I suggest sticking to plain. Minor nitpicks with an otherwise wonderful establishment!\n",
      "I have been here prob 5 times in past 6 months. I don't know what people are talking about when they say its a cheap eat. As a fan of indian/paki food i can say that the quality here is OK  and while the place looks and feels like a dive  the prices are not THAT cheap. A platter and drink will cost you $12-14. That's how much you pay for entrees at most indian/paki/turkish/ME places in Philly. The stick kebabs are VERY GOOD but aside from that  rest of food is bland. I tried standard barbecue boneless chicken and beef platters and they were bland. The Biryani is good. But other curry dishes including spinach and chick peas were either way too OILY or spicy. Also  another annoying thing is that when the owner is not there  the guys-esp the short one-are very inefficient-food comes out way too slow. Even when not busy  i have always waited atleast 20 mins. Its not the grill time  its how they process the order. Watch them next time at counter. YES  i have had a hair in my salad too. They apologized and were sorry about it.  About the whole dive thing...Comon  how much does it cost to replace 12 tables with chairs and put down a new Vinyl floor? The owners can and should do better. The place has a grimey 'be careful what you touch' feel to it. As one of the reviewers said...i am not looking for white table cloth service  but atleast it should be clean. There is no romanticism in dirty. Honestly  i think the real reason this place is busy is because of its parking lot. If you havent tried Wah-ji-Wah up the block Do SO. Their food is usually good.   Bottom line: Go for the stick kebab or Biryani. And bring some hand sanitizer.\n",

      "This place is pretty cute I guess.  It looks like a retro diner and is pretty small.  My boyfriend and I went here for dinner on a Monday night and it was packed and extremely busy.    We ordered off the daily menu (the chicken curry) and also the tandoori chicken off the kabobs.  Both came with a small salad  a side of a vegetable dish (not much choice here  there was only lentils or eggplant&potatoes but it probably varies depending on what they felt like making that day)  a large portion of naan  and rice.  They took about 15-20 minutes for them to prepare it  which sucked but at the same time it's understandable because there were only two people working there.  They pack everything into one of those styrofoam to-go containers if you order it to go so you don't really get that much of the vegetables or the salad..so mostly it's just rice and the protein that you chose.    I do have to give them props for having vegetarian dishes that are cheaper than the meat dishes ($7 compared to around $10) and having a variety of meat dishes (lamb  beef  chicken  etc).    They use charcoal to grill the kabobs! Yummy.  Also the naan portion is really generous and isn't soggy  etc.  Will definitely be back in the future!  Definitely worth a try.\n",
      "I went yesterday with my friends  the food is very tasty. We eat outside  nice environment. The chicken karahi is superb and delicious. ...simply it's awesome.......\n",
      "Pakistani joints like this seem to be relatively few to come by  but Kabobeesh does things properly. Chicken tikkas along with naans (Tip: get the mint chutney as well) are fantastic and well worth your time! I can't wait to try the other gravies they serve up  if only I can get out of the habit of ordering the Tikkas each time!\n",
      "Love Kabobeesh! Not fancy inside by any means  it's an old repurposed diner  but the food is great  and you get a whole lot if you order a meal. Everything's no-frills but the taste. Highly recommend the Resham beef and the chicken kabobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazing gastronomic experience  We ordered beef kabab  chicken charkha  Tandoori chicken  chicken Tikka kabab  great chicken karahi & To die for Lamb karahi This place is truly a GEM in Philly  Staff was super friendly & so was the owner  Overall great family experience\n",
      "The atmosphere of this place is fantastic. Very fancy inside  but it feels so weird to be eating casual food in such a nice restaurant. I got deluxe pho and my friend got a beef rice dish. Their food is very nicely prepared  but the taste is alright. the beef for the rice was very nicely marinated though. But my beef in my soup was alright. Definitely had better.  Other vietnamese restaurants have more bang for your buck. Maybe it's me getting used to eating casual food at casual restaurants. I probably won't be back because I know better pho places.\n",
      "I am very surprised I haven't reviewed this yet as I have been here at least half a dozen times. My five star review is based not only on my last visit but on all of my other visits as well! The atmosphere is great  service wonderful  portions generous  and food delicious - what more could you want?\n",
      "Very disappointing. The food was not flavorful at all. The only saving grace was that the decor was very modern and sleek. It is a nice change from the typical hole in the wall style of other Vietnamese restaurants in the area.  If you are trying to introduce someone who is new to Vietnamese cuisine and that person is not your most adventurous eater  Le Viet is a good choice. Otherwise  go to any other place on Washington and you'll have better food and more money in your wallet.\n",
      "Great authentic Vietnamese food  great ambiance and service  inexpensive.  I had clay pot ribs and the sauce was phenomenal.\n",
      "They have a 4.95 lunch special on weekdays if you eat in between 11am-3pm. The interior is swanky and it's far away enough from the typical office buildings that there isn't a crowd to battle during lunch.  I ordered the Bún Bò Nng Ch Giò and thankfully didn't have to try pronouncing it to the waiter  just pointed it out. It came out within a reasonable amount of time  they have an open kitchen so you can see the chefs working away.   The food was well presented and used fresh  crisp ingredients. I burned my tongue on the hot and crispy egg roll and the noodles were a perfect texture. The waiters do a good job of being attentive but not hovering and letting you take your time.  I will say that Vietnamese restaurants usually load you up on portions but this one was surprisingly moderate. I didn't have that \\stuffed to the gills\\\" sensation that inevitably follows a bowl of pho at Nam Phuong. It's good for a light lunch but if you need something substantial  it's easy enough to order an additional appetizer considering the price of the entrees.\"\n",
      "That's how much we have left over  that should says all about the food. Very disappointed. The interior decoration is pretty and the staffs are friendly.\n",
      "Summary: * It is difficult for me to rate this place \\ok\\\" since I love Vietnamese food.  Oh where  oh where can I find wholesome Vietnamese food that is delicately prepared with fresh ingredients to quench my longing for the taste of home cooking?  * I like the service and the ambiance  both are inviting and energetic. * Go here for the happy hour  to get the best value for the good small dishes and ok drinks.    Food: The different soups or noodles  and tofu plates are meh...just plain tasting and a disappointing imitation of what Vietnamese soup should taste like.  The happy hour food is actually not bad.  Cocktails are too sweet. Almost every drink is sweet -- so sweet that the desserts seem like palate cleansers.   Location: Good luck finding decent parking around dinner time.    Service: Great service\"\n",
      "This place was a 5 star rating when it was BYOB  for me...let's just say after that went away I had to downgrade to 4 star rating. It's still a great place to go but that BYOB just really placed it on the top of my list.   The atmosphere is modern  clean lines and cozy. The staff are very friendly and you do not feel rushed while dining  compared to other Viet restaurants in the area. When I come here  I do not order the Pho mainly because I feel that the Pho are just better at other Viet restaurants in the area but this restaurant serves up some really amazing sizzling  sauteed  stir fry  clay pot dishes that I have tasted.   The quality of these other dishes are awesome  full of crab meat  giant shrimp and very filling dishes. Yes  the Pho may not do it for me but it's a great restaurant for other dishes that I crave and return to over and over and over again.\n",
      "\n",
      "My new favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Philly. The food is just so good and fresh. Appetizer pho? Yes  please!!! Definitely a step up in quality from nam phoeng without a noticeable diff in price. I'll be back for sure .\n",
      "A place just for Mac and Cheese? Yes pl(ch)eeeeseee!  hearing about this place and I automatically knew I had to come and try it out. I really like the food! You get to build your own or select from the premade menu items! Cheesy? meaty options?satisfying?  the environment is great. The tables face towards the windows so u can look outside. The shop itself is pretty small so there aren't many tables  but that's alright.   Food comes quick and price for Mac and cheese is alright I guess. I think it's a bit much for how much you get (pretty small) and it's not like it's the BEST Mac I've ever tasted though. I was expecting a bit more since this place specializes in Mac and cheese afterall. Still give this place a try though! It's still very delicious\n",
      "These girls have mac on lock. it was fast  clean and i was stuck in traffic eating allll my food. (and you know i was hot when i saw on Facebook the next day they had a sale) but that is what i love about them... they give and give!  if you can try the mac with the cheese steak on top.....seriously a top notch!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "If you like Mac n Cheese you will love this place. It's located on a very busy street filled with shops and other surrounding restaurants. Mac Mart is very small so not ideal for crowds. Not a lot of seating but based on there niche it's probably expected.  They have a variety of options on how you want your dish. I went with the Jalapeño Poppers. Service was quick and my food was ready in no time. They do serve you your dish in a Rubbermaid type of container which doesn't look like much but it was very filling. The dish it's self was great  I loved it!! I would highly recommend this place for all  Mac n Cheese lovers. I also like how they encourage you to keep the container b/c it's reusable and encourages recycling. Overall service was good\n",
      "Let's start off by saying that I love  LOVE  Mac and cheese. Saying that  I have to say that the Mac and cheese here is so externally good  I got \\The buff\\\" and it was so creamy and cheesy that I was literally just hit with all the flavors on this. The price/quantity is very good. I think the most expensive one is about $12 and the amount is more than enough to share with someone else ( But  what crazy person would ever share Mac and cheese? )   The store is very cute and although small with the outdoor seating is just so cute. The staff is super friendly and they're Sheryl temple is the best. And just the fact that they are environmentally conscious just gives them the extra point they didn't need at this point  you are actually able to take the container that they give you to re-use\"\n",
      "Mac Mart is awesome. They have great menu items and try new limited time things that turn out to be really tasty. They had a cheesesteak topped with mac and cheese a few months ago and it was so good. When you feel like having a cheat day  this is a great spot.\n",
      "Mac and cheese is really tasteless. Not worth the price at all. Got the BBQ Bowl. Dry chicken   chewy macaronis  and soggy cornbread \\crunch\\\"\"\n",

      "\n",
      "I've had Mac Mart now 3 times. Once last year  and twice this year (so far) at the different Night Markets throughout the city. I love this Mac so freakin much  I have to write a review now!!   When I see that hot pink truck  I start jumping like a little kid and I get so excited!! I will wait in the longest line for this Mac  I don't care! It's that good.   The BBQ chicken Mac is my favorite so far  but they always change the flavors so you can always try something new! I love that! I recently had the spinach & artichoke Mac  that was killer also. All the special combo macs are better than their 7 cheese original  IMO.  so try something fancy!  The Mac is so creamy and rich  that's what I love. You hardly taste the noodles cause the cheese and other toppings are so rich.. That's how you make Mac!! It should be so creamy that it sticks to the roof of your mouth.. Yes! Mac mart does it right!!   I got 2 of my friends hooked on it already  who's never had it before. They love it too! And the staff working the truck are so friendly they rock.   Can't wait for the next night market so I can eat this creamy cheesy amazing goodness all over again! MAC MART!!! Don't change a thing  you guys are amazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is amazing!  They make the donuts fresh with each order.  In fact  I had to wait 10 minutes for them to cool down before I could eat them.  This location is clean and never super busy.  Its a really great addition to the neighborhood and people with cars are sure to appreciate the parking lot.  Best donuts in Philly and the Delaware Valley.\n",
      "All those cereal commercials are lying to you. A balanced breakfast doesn't consist of milk  OJ  cereal  and a banana. If you want a balanced breakfast  you should hop in line for fried chicken  a glazed donut  and coffee from FedNuts.    I'm not much of a sweet breakfast person  but the donuts are great here. The chicken is wonderful  no matter how you have it dressed - wet or dry  they're all good. And when you're eating chicken and donuts for breakfast you're probably going to need something to get you moving afterwards  the coffee.  Oh  and don't try to convince someone to come with you that needs an explanation on why those two foods are served together. Those people don't deserve it.\n",
      "The donuts are nice but nothing out of extraordinary . I just ordered two simple donuts   one chicken sandwich ( they are really tiny ) and black ice coffee ( plain) and paid 15$ . Cold brew costs $3 25!!!  ... that is more expensive then Starbucks charges for plain black coffee ... again coffee is ok . They charging $1.75 for ONE plain donut and $2.75 for \\fancy\\\" donuts .... way too overpriced for a donut joint ! And the atmosphere and cleaning of the shop is not aligned with the prices they charge !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh! First off  it smells delicious!  Secondly  it tastes delicious!!  We didn't know that our order of chicken came with a donut so we had ordered donuts  too  which we ended up not being disappointed about.   They probably didn't tell us that they came with donuts because they just thought we wanted more...? Who knows.   I ordered sweet garlic wings  the hubs ordered the combo of buttermilk ranch  and we shared in order to try different flavors. They were both scrumptious but I preferred my sweet garlic. And the donut that came with it was so juicy which sounds weird but then later someone outside of the restaurant had told us it was a honey donut which made sense.   We also ordered the guava donut forgot what it was called though  and that too despite sounding weird was really yummy.   Anyway  gave it 4 stars for now cos it was my first time and it was good. It'll have to wait for my return in an estimated year or so to get bumped up to a 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just went for the first time and this place is AMAZING!!! I tried the chicken sandwich and it was incredible. Hot  crispy  juicy  tender and flavorful all at once. I can't wait to try one of the donuts. I might go back tomorrow...\n",

      "My husband and I had been looking forward to trying this place out by was quite underwhelmed with our experience.   We got one of each of the fancy donut flavors which are currently chocolate old fashioned  s'mores  peanut butter malt  key lime pie  pineapple brown sugar  and blueberry lemonade. The first three (on top) were OK  the last three (on the bottom) were not good at all. The icing flavors just didn't mix well together with the actual donut. For $2 per donut for donuts I was not impressed with at all  I would not get donuts from here again. Save yourself some money and go to Beilers for better donuts that are only $1 per. The fact that the store is called \\Federal DONUTS\\\" and only had six \\\"fancy donut\\\" flavors and three \\\"sprinkled sugar\\\" flavors was also far from impressive.   I hear the fried chicken here is good so maybe one day we'll come back to check that out. But definitely not the donuts.\"\n",

      "I landed here for a Paint Nite with my coworkers. We decided to head over a little early for dinner before our artistic adventure. We were all thrilled right off the bat because they had Not Your Father's Root Beer. To top it off  it was (according to some random Instagram account) National Root Beer Float Day. Who am I to refuse to celebrate that? Our waitress happily added some vanilla ice cream for a round of adult root beer floats- YUM! I ended up having the California grilled chicken sandwich. Add avocado and mango salsa to anything and I'm in! Between the tots I chose as my side and the root beer float  my inner child was a very happy camper. The restaurant is pretty large and open with lots of table and bar seating. It seems to be in line with what I picture \\saloon\\\" to mean in my head. My only complaint is that our waitress was a little MIA for how dead it was in there. I know this isn't a Paint Nite review- but we had wonderful time at that as well!! Overall  a great night!\"\n",
      "Terrible  terrible place!!! The staff was very rude  it amazes me people in customer service could actually be so hostile to their own customers. I went during an open bar and the bartender was actually requesting tips after every drink and even asked for a drink back when she wasn't happy with the tip amount. Then at the end of the night I watched them laugh at some girl who appeared to have lost her coat check ticket (and was crying!)  telling her she was basically out of luck and wouldn't be able to get her jacket back. Outrageous behavior.\n",

Everything tasted fried  heavy and average. The wings just had tons of sauce  chicken fingers were average  tater tots were standard  nachos were pretty bad with just peppers and a little cheese on top  hummus was pretty ok. Also  they have tiny mini water glasses which is not fun when thirsty. And it is also extremely dark in there. So I think it's just not my type of place but I'm sure others would like it alot.\n",
      "Mikaela and I came here on our grand food tour of Philly. It may have been stop 20 of the day. Yes  we were full  and slightly drunk.. but we couldn't resist!   The atmosphere is casual  very dark  and very \\saloon\\\" like. There are quaint candles that provide the only light. It has a rustic feel  and you feel like cowboys are going to swing through the front doors any moment  with beers in hand  and boots covered in Philly dirt. I loved it. It was a throwback in time  but also still felt like a place you wanted to be. A great bar!   We ordered from their large selection of beers with dinner and for... our 8th meal of the day... I got the mac n cheese.. and the tater tots. I can never say no to tater tots  and automatically love anywhere that offers it. The mac n cheese was filling  creamy  and hit the spot... I Loved it! Yes  it is a bar  and bar food... but compared to other  bar food it exceeded my expectations.   We then meandered to the bar for some good cheap budlights  and it was a fun young crowd... i loved the atmosphere  the vibes  and the food!\"\n",
      "Really hoping I don't get their bartender in trouble  but when you order a beer here (their selection is small but covers all tastes and is high quality!) you will get a BEER...as in  your glass will be filled to the brim! My new Sunday routine has become to come here for a burger in the afternoon. Their burgers are cooked just the way YOU ask  and you can custom order. I'm happy that I found this place in my neighborhood!!\n",
      "Great local bar with most of the sports games on tons of TV's  great food and well priced drinks. The wings are great  as are the loaded tots!\n",
      "Pho noodle soup taste good..... but after I ate it..... i had a SERIOUSLY SEVERE DIARRHEA!!!! almost fainted.  B c I allergic to MSG and I think they put A LOT of MSG !!! in the soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had better Pho  but the customer service and friendly wait staff make me want to come here every time I want Pho. I also really love the shrimp & pork rolls. Definitely stop by. It's a very welcoming place on a cold day. It's especially nice to go there straight from the greyhound station.\n",
      "3.5 stars. I ordered the pho and spring rolls. The spring roles were pretty good and the pho wasn't bad  but definitely not the best I've had. Their customer service is a little lacking but I think that's mostly due to the language barrier.\n",
      "I love this place for a quick  inexpensive Pho fix. I usually get the vermicelli instead of the traditional Pho  with the grilled beef and spring roll (#53) and it's always the best. Hands down  the best grilled beef at any Pho place I've been to so far (it's not chewy and doesn't taste like it's been boiled first). The spring rolls  too  are perfect and crispy. If only the places on Washington Ave. could get it right like this place!   The service is fast and friendly for the most part  although I would avoid it at it's peak (Noon) to avoid any service pitfalls that could easily occur at any packed place. Nevertheless  the #53 keeps me coming back time and time again.  I recently went for lunch and got the Pho with crispy flank steak and I had to update my review because it was so delicious. The broth wasn't too fatty  nor was the steak. Once again  Pho Cali has exceeded my expectations and I'll be coming back for more :)   Special Note: They have beer  which comes in handy because in order to pay with a card  you have to spend more than $10.\n",
      "I got the \\rare steak and flank steak\\\" pho for lunch.  While the meat was nicely prepared and the portion was large  I found the broth to be a little too oily and the noodles to be  a little too soft.  Overall  I would pick Pho 75 around the corner over this place for the food quality (although this place has better ambiance).\"\n",
      "I came here for lunch and I'm glad I did. I decided to carry out some pho and it was just as good as eating in. My coworkers were jealous and I was extremely full and happy.   I was a bit worried because it took me about 20 minutes to get down there from work and with a hour lunch  I didn't know if I would have time  but after ordering my food it only took them 5 minutes to have it ready. And it was delicious. I received a huge portion of pho and could barely finish it all  but forced myself to do it. Waste not want not. This is definitely a place I will go to for when craving pho for lunch (or dinner). It's quick and cheap  and a delicious filling meal.\n",
      "I had shrimp pho here on a Saturday with some friends. Our food came out quickly  and the shrimp did not have tails (thank you). This was only my third or fourth time eating pho  but it seemed heavy on the noodles.   Shrimp were cooked nicely  the service was friendly  but I'm still not sure I was feelin' the broth. Nonetheless  I ate almost all of it before tapping out  so it certainly wasn't bad!\n",
      "I am still a fan of this place. It's really cheap and the food here is delicious. That being said  I hate it when the restaurant makes it known that they're waiting for you to get out. The place closed at 10:30 and they had the door locked by 10:20. We were the last group there  and it's not like we were sitting around and talking  because we had just finished our food and were taking care of the bill. They had their music on  had already started cleaning  and the kitchen staff was staring extra hard like we were planning on ordering something else. That's all well and good  but don't make me feel like I'm wasting your time when the restaurant isn't even officially closed. We walked out the door at 10:28 and they locked it behind us.  However  I just have to give it 4 stars because of the cheapness and the deliciousness of all the food! The service leaves something to be desired  but I'll be here again and again if the menu remains the same.\n",
      "We were looking for some banh mi to go and this was one of the places in Chinatown that took credit card. We tried to order two beef banh mi sandwiches  which came out to ~$9  but they have a &15 credit card minimum  so we ordered some Thai tea to go as well. While we were waiting for the sandwiches to be prepped  we sipped on the small Thai tea. It was pretty good  but they filled it with a lot of ice  so there wasn't much tea. By the time I finished the tea  the sandwiches were ready. The good thing about this place is that the food came out fast  but let me tell you about the banh mi sandwich. It was very dryyyyyy... I should've kept the Thai tea so that it would help to swallow the dry bread and dry meat. The pickled carrots and onions helped to give the sandwich a little flavor  but it was not very enjoyable. It seems this place is good for their pho  but not for their banh mi sandwiches.\n",
      "They do cheesesteaks - inexpensive and classic.  Nevermind the down-and-out surroundings  you're in the right place.  Just a friendly pointer from a former Cheez Whiz critic - don't hate! Provolone may be a prettier word  but its just watered-down Swiss. After finally trying my first Whiz-steak  I see why PA stands behind it.\n",
      "Three generations  soon to be four  have had the pleasure eating Jim's Steaks and Hoagies over the years.  I've had cheesesteaks from all over the world from Singapore to LA and no one can compare to these guys. Just last week I made a 6 hour round trip just to get my cheesesteak fix.  From the roll  to the fried onions that caramelize on the grill all day to the Whiz.....Jim's is hands down the best!\n",
      "This place is pretty dope but here are a few tips 1. Order pick up -  The wait here seems crazy !! Only day you'll find a spot is a cold Sunday. 2. CASH ONLY ! 3. If your inside they have a few more seats upstairs. 4. Order extra Wiz on EVERYTHING\n",
      "It was solid  but the toppings are cold... canned or boiled mushroom thrown on top and not heated  etc.   I found Ishkabibble's down the way muchhh better!\n",
      "The question usually comes down to: Geno's or Pat's?  Well  I am pleased to tell you that you can stop rattling your brain over such a moronic question.There's no need to buy into this feud between dueling \\quality\\\" cheese steak establishments. Screw which one's better. Does it really matter when neither of them make the best cheese steak in the city to begin with?  You all know where Jim's Steaks is and if you don't  just walk along South Street and look for a long-@ss line. People often ask me  \\\"Is it worth the wait?\\\" Well  let's see. Do you want your taste buds to scream in sweet  sweet (or savory  savory) ecstasy? I'm assuming you're on Yelp because you do. I suggest bringing along a Jim's vet to help you with the order. You need to be loud  confident  and on point. The cooks are actually really nice guys  show them respect and they will provide you with a delicious meal.  Geno's or Pat's? Geno's or Pat's? Avoid the petty competition and just go to Jim's.  Peace.\"\n",

      "I was visiting from Miami Florida and wanted to eat a good Philly cheese steak. I asked everyone I saw walking by where the best Philly cheese steak was. Most people said \\Jims Steak's\\\".So When I went there was a line to the exit. But most people said the line goes fast.   It was true we were at the front door in less than ten minutes. when I got the cheese steak I went up stairs and ate the whole thing in 7 minutes! It was that good. After when I left I was thinking that that was so Delicious. So I went back and got another one.\"\n",
      "The Cheesesteaks were awesome  the size were huge. Only thing is that the places is in a weird neighborhood and there's no real place to seat an eat. Next time I go to Philly I will definitely try this place again.\n",
      "Was a visitor and this place was referenced many times.  I tried the cheese steak and  I honestly wasn't impressed. It seemed like the meat was watered down or something... Was lacking flavor big time.. I never put salt or pepper on my food.  Other then that it was ok... I just felt I could get it anywhere else you know?  Lots of history there and maybe at one point it use to be really good.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went here for a birthday dinner and oh boy was it delicious. We ordered the whole grilled fish  which was a branzino that night. The fish was perfectly cooked!! It was soft and flakey and super tasty. We stripped it right from the bone piece by piece. We also ordered the grilled cauliflower  which was complete with a caviar paste. The cauliflower was perfectly cooked and super yummy and flavorful. We also ordered a bottle of wine to complete our meal. I definitely recommend eating here!! The atmosphere is boho chic  the staff are super attentive and the owner is very nice.\n",
      "The drinks deserve an enthusiastic 5/5 for flavor.  They have a great list of unique beers and fancy cocktails.  The raspberry flute was extremely tasty.  Not too sweet  no alcohol taste  just smooth.    Decor is fantastic.  Looks like they ordered from Etsy :P lots of reclaimed wood  poofy ottomans  and interesting chandeliers and other lighting.  My kind of place.  Prices are a bit steep  but I heard they have great happy hour specials.  I'll keep that in mind for next time.  I docked a star because  while I understand this is a seafood restaurant  they make exceptions for things like a burger or brisket sandwich  but seem to have no vegetarian options aside from salad.  It could alienate certain people if you have a large party coming in.\n",
      "I really wanted to love this place because it caught my eyes immediately with its artistic outdoor space and punny window painting of \\Friends with Benedicts\\\" next to a crab. Then I found out it had happy hour 4:30 - 6:30 pm EVERY day  which meant $1 oysters  clams  shrimps on a Saturday! Yessss.  The inside is very Bohemian feel  and felt like it could totally be a hipster's arts & crafts workshop if you took away all the tableware. Spent 10 mins just absorbing in all the art and documenting it. That aside  we practically ordered everything on the happy hour menu.  HOWEVER.  $1 oysters were on the extra small size (~3 inches)  with a briny note and a mineral finish. I prefer larger and sweeter ones  so these were ok in my book. This was the first raw oyster experience for some ppl in our party  so I was let down that this was their first (and possibly) last impression for them. If you're really craving raw oysters on the weekend  this place seals the deal  but I'd wait for the weekday $1 deal at Oyster House instead.  $1 clams were not super fresh. Flesh was not sweet  and the taste was very fishy. Would've probably passed if I got to sample.  $1 shrimp was large  but not juicy nor sweet. It reminded me of the AYCE shrimp from buffets. Mediocre as well.  Fried cauliflower was WAY sour for some reason  like someone tripped and spilled lemon juice all over it. I would've liked it if it weren't for the sourness.   Other items we ordered that were decent  but not memorable to order again - vodka martini (pretty strong)  fried calamari (could be crispier)  8oz Wagyu burger ($14  but was it really Wagyu?)  Yummy items worth re-ordering: duck fat fries (hard to get these wrong) and scallop ceviche.   Overall  could've  would've  should've been the new seafood go-to place but I wasn't impressed by the standards they held their seafood to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Atmosphere and Service get 5 stars.  The food on the other hand was just ok.   Ordered the Salmon Tartare which wasn't tartare at all.  It was actually cooked and was loaded with chopped onions.  It was more like a salmonfish salad.  Ended up sending it back.  Looking at the menu again after the fact  it does say 'poached'  but that doesn't make sense because tartare mean 'served raw' so the fact that it was cook threw us all off.   I ordered the lobster special with the grilled corn.  Having checked the website prior to going. I saw a picture of a lobster cut in half and grilled.  On the web it looked amazing.  What I got was the whole lobster cooked and just plopped on my plate.  It was very basic presentation  very messy and not at all what I was expecting.  The quality of the lobster was good  fresh and well cooked  but it was just a lobster with butter.    Also ordered the bloody mary shrimp cocktail.  The shrimp were good and a large size  but there was no ummph to it.  Compared to the picture on line with the chili rimmed glass and spices  it was very basic. Fried Cauliflower was amazing.   Friends had the steak which was good but nothing to write home about.  I think this place has a lot of potential.  Maybe we just came on the wrong night.\n",
      "Wow.  So much about the place is so right.  (Our server was amazingly clueless  but I don't really care.  Everything else was so good I forgot all about her thankfully.)  It's hard to single any one item out bc we ate damn near everything on the menu  but I'd recommend doing what we did and go with a group (we had 6) and simply go nuts.  Gun to the head top 3?  Scallops  cauliflower and salmon.  The sauces are divine.  Portions are small  but so flavorful.  Didn't partake in the cocktails  but that'll be chapter 2 after the next visit.  They sound great.  This place is gonna be around for awhile.  No doubt.\n",
      "This place is so cute! Stopped in for happy hour yesterday  food and drinks were great and staff was very friendly and attentive. Will definitely return!\n",
      "This review is for their happy hour dinner experience. After discovering their $1 oysters and clams HH deal  I had to come here  yes  2 nights in a row. Maybe I was craving oysters?? The service was fantastic. On the second night we were served by a fairly new person - I believe his name was Benjamin. He was very friendly and attentive. The oysters were my personal favorite and my friend likes the clams. We also shared the fried Brussel sprouts with are well seasoned and addicting. I had a sip of my friend's mojito and although I'm no expert  I do think the drink could have been mixed better. I'm definitely going to come here again for their happy hour if I have an oyster craving!\n",
      "\n",
      "Stopped in to Pine Fish on Saturday of the July 4th weekend. We were happy to find they offer a happy hour 7 days of the week. We had the oysters  which were fresh and shucked perfectly in that neither one of us chewed on any shell pieces. We also had the octopus  which we really liked  but the star of our meal was the crab cake. The service was great and we also really liked the decor. We'll definitely be back soon.\n",
      "I'm going to start with saying that Kensington Quarters served the best wild boar pasta I've ever had. The place has a 1940s butcher shop restaurant feel to it. The service is quick and perceptive  although I came with a larger party no one sat with an empty glass or plate. The food is what new American food should be  clean  delicious  and innovative. Definitely recommend this place.\n",
      "My first time at Kensington Quarters on Friday May 27th. What surprised me   no let me be more specific what confused me was seeing all the beautiful meat in the front case  the only beef option was a burger O.o O.o  When the kind waiter tried to explain the concept  well I'm still not clear why there is no other choice but burgers.  My first reaction was insult  just for a half a second  until I got on board with their choices ordered the sword fish  a fish I hadn't eaten since the 80's. None of the other meats offered  on the menu interested me. My entree was delicious  the asparagus was cut very tenderly in small pieces yet still maintained the crispness while the sauce was velvety smooth  the swordfish was cut in pieces which made the dish visually appetizing.  It was disappointing eating fish while up front in the case  a perfectly trimmed and cut NY strip steak or Porterhouse was just waiting for me to devour it.   Now would someone please explain this restaurant to me  I was thinking if I bought a piece of meat could I request it cooked by the kitchen for a price of course?  One last thing  the cocktails and wine  my guest and I had a cocktail at another establishment before deciding on trying KQ  so I didn't want to drink but a glass of wine with my meal. The glass selection was fine  the glass I ordered was good  a red wine  which I prefer to white but I wanted a white glass of wine. The only other glass was a sherry?  I wasn't familiar with the kind of sherry it was  I think of sherry it reminds me of a tiny little glass to drink. I'm only familiar with the amazing sherry vinegar made in Spain.   Now here's the bad stuff  my guest ordered a Pimm's Cup  just by chance at the other establishment as we were about to order a second round  I was drinking Blue Sapphire and tonic my guest a scotch drinker   I asked the very knowledgeable mixologist if she could make a Pimm's Cup. When she responded favorably I was surprised she knew it.  So my new favorite knowledgeable mixologist   mixed us up two Pimm's Cups  the most delicious I've ever drank  my guest in full agreement. My guest liked it so much they ordered one at Kensington Quarters. To our disappointment  it was a disaster  the color  the lack of garnish but the taste  was not even close. I admit  it's not a drink ordered often this side of the pond   so we both agree to let it slide.  Now back to my original question  Can someone please explain to me the idea of this place ?  I did buy a bag of beef jerky for my dog who is pictured in my profile   she lovvvvved them.   Thank You for a fun evening  the staff were exceptionally pleasant  Even when I grilled that poor waiter about the place. He was so kind and patient with me.  The entire experience was fun  I want to go back but do I have too  buy the meat and cook it home? I guess that's an option   The display case is soooooo beautiful a carnivore's jewelry case.\n",
      "Loved my birthday dinner at Kensington Quarters! The outdoor patio is a beautiful spot to have some delicious food and wine and catch the sunset with a large group  and if you're lucky the entire patio will serenade you with the sweet musical stylings of the birthday song when the waiter brings out dessert with a candle!  Our waitress was super helpful and guided us in the right direction with which specials to order and which to skip (appreciate the honesty) and which rose would pair well with our first plates (and was affordable). The bartender mixed up some delicious drinks  compete with dramatically clapped thyme and even took requests for mocktails and no egg whites.  The food! Everything tasted so fresh and flavorful and  the portion sizes were just right! 6 ladies shared:  - 6 month aged ham special with snap peas- this ain't your Easter ham. Thinly sliced and nestled within crisp veggies in a light vinaigrette.  Perfect.  - The swordfish in delicious butter sauce you'll want to eat with a spoon. Crisp radishes and asparagus and greens bathed in butter. Favorite entree.  - Beet salad- bright  refreshing  with delicious cheese sauce which was put on the side for our pregnant friend). - Baked brie with pesto sauce and pine nuts- gooey deliciousness. - Pork shoulder with potato cakes - so tender and delicious.  -Lamb Bolognese fettucini- so good and a large portion. - Mushroom lasagna- great flavors   but not my favorite.  - Kouign Aman- flaky croissant like pastry with cardamom ice cream and pistachios. Perfect end to the meal and not too heavy.   With 1 bottle of wine total came to $40 per person with tax and tip which was a great value for all that we got!  Highly recommend  definitely worth the trip to Kensington.\n",
      "Truly a great dinner.  At this point in my life I don't eat a lot of meat (a bit of a \\save the planet\\\" combined with a bit of a \\\"don't hurt the animals\\\")  so when I go to a restaurant in order to eat something like a burger or a pork shoulder  it better be exceptional - and here they both were. My wife thought this burger was the best she'd ever had - it was truly great - no toppings other than some fried veggies required!  This restaurant is not pretentious  includes their own butcher shop (hence the amazing quality of their meat)  and the dishes overall are top notch. The accompanying vegetables and such were fresh (I believe farm-to-table) and perfectly cooked.  Will definitely take friends here when they visit.\"\n",
      "Worst poached eggs I've ever eaten (I've had hard boiled eggs that were runnier than this). When I asked the waiter about it  he laughed and walked alway rudely. Unfortunately the tip was included.\n",
      "\n",
      "[This review in its' entirety appears on my blog: www.fare-game.net]  The décor is clean  bright and industrial  with exposed pipes and metallics but also brings that butcher aesthetic with a thick wooden bar and tables. Bartenders and servers also wear full aprons  as if they're prepared to step behind the butcher counter and break down a lamb or pig at any moment. An open kitchen and windowed butcher fridge give the place an expansive and accessible feel.  There is also another bar and classroom upstairs that have not officially opened yet.  We sat at the downstairs bar across from the butcher counter and ogled the variety of meats offered while ordering drinks. KQ offers a select choice of drafts  cocktails and wines. While perusing the menu I saw a whole pig get brought in  wrapped in paper  put down on the butcher block and start getting broken down.  If you are not a meat-eater  I hazard to guess this sort of ambience is not your thing and would recommend sitting in the back seating area (but I personally thought it was neat!).  Non-meat offerings are available as the menu is divided into \\small plates \\\" \\\"starches  grains  greens \\\" and \\\"entrees.\\\"   But like the carnivores that we are  we were there to get some tasty animal flesh!  We stuck to the small plates menu so we could try a few different things.  Here's what we sampled:   - Maitake Mushroom - the mushrooms were served two ways: as part of a puff pastry that included carmelized onion  and lightly sautéed on a bed of mixed greens with a blue cheese garnish both crumbled and as a sauce on the side. The tart was light and airy and worked well with the subtle blue cheese (gorgonzola dolce I believe) sauce. The whole mushrooms were sautéed to perfection  with the ends having a nice crispy texture. The meatiness of the maitake paired with the crumbled blue cheese and mixed greens and was umami-heaven.  - Rare Beef - [Beef sourced from Wyebrook farm in Honey Brook  PA and Perry County Land & Cattle in New Port  PA]  Rare is not an understatement! With only a slight sear on the outer edges  this reminded me of a tartar but sliced into thin strips instead of finely chopped. Served on top of toasted sourdough and a bed or arugula and dressed very simply with a subtle hint of horseradish  parsley and lemon  the flavors were bright and really allowed the beef to stand out as extremely fresh and flavorful.  - Lamb Ravioli - [Grass fed Lamb sourced from Double Brook farm in Hopewell  NJ] This was a special not on the regular menu  and I'm so glad we chose it as it was by far our favorite dish of the night. Lamb meat and lamb liver were combined into a light and airy mousse within the pasta  tossed in a brown butter reduction and rosemary and topped with aged goat cheese. Seriously all I can say is WOW. This was like a flavor bomb exploded in my mouth! The layers of richness and texture  the strong slightly bitter taste of the aged goat cheese shavings  the soft texture of the pasta combined with the nutty brown butter  and the decadent velvety metallic tang of the liver and meat mousse was just pure perfection. I'm not sure how long this special will be available but I'm deploring you to get it while you can  or better yet KQ  add this to your menu!  Our bartenders were attentive and extremely helpful and kind. We were full on the 3 small plates items but I would like to go back again and try an entrée next time.  KQ is a bit pricy  I wouldn't be able to afford going here all the time but I was extremely satisfied with the portions we received for the price.  I was hoping to get the skinny on when the upstairs classroom will open but they're still in the planning stages with that  the bartender noted.  Kensington Quarters is a great addition to Kensington and I highly recommend it to my carnivore friends!\"\n",

      "Edit: The manager got in touch to thank me for my straight forward review and offer me a gift to make up for the matter. You almost never see that kind of class and appreciation for customers  and it completely makes up for the small inconvenience at dinner. Coupled with the great tasting food  drinks  enjoyable ambiance  and now  top notch service  I feel good upgrading this to 5 stars  it is deserved.  -- We ordered the meat plate for four. Three of us ate it and were not full. We politely questioned the server about this undesirable circumstance and it was only then that she said people usually order a couple of starters with it. That would have been nice to know ... at the start of our meal.   BUT. The meats themselves were pretty good  especially the steak and sausages.\n",

      "In my never ending search for awesome happy hours in the city I'm glad to say that triumph is top 3 for sure. My criteria for happy hours consists of two major factors. The food selection and the atmosphere. Alcohol is not a factor mainly because the specials for alcohol are fairly consistent at most happy hours.  Food is critical for a good happy hour  let's face it after a long day of work a good drink and a small and tasty snack that holds you off till 730-8 is exactly what's needed. Triumph delivers on food in a big way  fries risotto balls  Cajun chicken poppers and sliders to name a few  but I remember the menu having a lot more options. The cost for the above ranges from 3-5 dollars and is totally worth it.  The atmosphere is totally chill  spacious and perfect for a good sized group. Only thing is that triumph is not so close to a lot of commerce so it's difficult to come out as often as I would like.\n",
      "Came here on a friend's recommendation and had a really great meal and experience.   As for the beers  I had the cocoa nibs beer -- really delicious and malty  but not too heavy. The Zitroen beer was really lovely too -- it had a strong chamomile flavor  which ironically  I don't like in teas  but was nicely floral tasting in the beer.  As for food  we started with the german pretzels  which were four yummy little nubs of bread with butter and salt drizzled over them. The mustard sauce was nothing special. I had the philly bacon cheeseburger -- a burger with the bacon replaced with pork belly  truffle aioli  a fried egg  and mornay sauce. This burger was genius -- and so delicious! The burger itself was huge. I was full after eating half of it. The truffle flavor was strong  but nicely complimented by the mornay sauce. If I lived in Philly  I'd be back for this sandwich  but I'd only order one and go halfsies. It's a massive sandwich.  My boyfriend had the fish and chips  which looked pretty typical and not very special. He was disappointed he got the thick \\chips\\\" and not the thin  crispy fries I got with mine. His dish came with a house made tarter  which wasn't very good - too salty and tasted of capers.  He wanted dessert  but there wasn't a big dessert selection  so ended up getting none.  The bathrooms in this place are unisex  which is kinda cool. And they played Nirvana the whole time we were there  which seemed strange  but also kinda cool  I guess. There was a good vibe here.\"\n",
      "Made the booking specifically to listen to live music and was told as soon as we arrived that they no longer have live music. Pretty disappointing. Food was average and cocktails are overpriced. Also  not a wide variety of beers at all... def not a good choice for a brewery. Overall pretty disappointing experience\n",
      "Very cool place. I had no idea  or I would have probably have gone much sooner. Nice vibe and great food! I had a kale salad with Parmesan and lemon dressing  and also fabulous calamari and mussels. Neat little seating area with lounge chairs  and rolling surfboard shaped table. New wave tunes and nice service. What more could you want in a microbrewery?\n",
      "I stopped in with my friends that live down the street from here.  I originally had intentions on eating there but my friends mentioned sushi so we just had beer instead.  I tried the the honey blonde beer  or at least thats what i think it was called.  It was good and we stayed for two each.  Had I not wanted sushi I probably would have worked on a good hangover in that place.  The inside of the restaurant bar is gorgeous  a classier place in my book to go to.\n",
      "I've been to Triumph several times and it's a really decent go to place when you find yourself in Olde City.  The thing I like about Triumph is that it's decently stylish and they are making their own beer right there.  You gotta love that.  It also smells very clean when you walk in.  They must keep those fermenters very sanitized.  When I lived in Jersey (which I feel like was eons ago) I used to go to the Triumph in Princeton alot.  Similar food but a very different layout/feel to it.  I like the one in Olde City because it just works well for the space.  I like their hummus platter and their tuna tartare.  Actually their tuna tartare was awesome.  I could have eaten way more of it.  The beers are very hit or miss in my opinion.  I did enjoy their pumpkin ale this weekend and their dry irish stout is one of the best in my opinion.  Very roasty and not heavy.  Mid range ABV  making it a nice session beer.  I don't like their lagers normally so I avoid them.  I've also found their IPAs to use hops that I am not fond of.  Still  this doesn't stop me from coming back.  I'm happy triumph is there as a destination in Olde City.  It has consistency and it's a great spot for weekend lunch.  I'm not sure I would pick it as a dinner destination  but I like how it's always in the back of my mind if I'm in the neighborhood.\n",
      "The regularly-rotating draft list makes me want to return to see what's new.  Coffee & Cream Stout?  Really?  Well it works - very smooth and creamy.  I was very surprised with the food here.  The first time I went they  had a sausage sandwich which was amazing  but unfortunately I haven't seen it since.  The few other items I've had have been good  but the Brewers Burger is one of the best burgers I've had in the city.  The bun is close to perfect - a soft  almost chewy texture and a some sweetness.  The beef is very tasty  and the sauteed onions round it all out.\n",
      "This place was great. Coming from California  I was looking for some good local brew. These guys definitely had it. The food was really good as well. The atmosphere inside is nice and casual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great Beers and Attentive Service!  We walked in without reservations on a Saturday night  4 adults plus toddler and we were seated within minutes! They helped us with our stroller and then placed us back where there was less traffic which we Greatly appreciated.  We had a mixed group so we sampled brews and cocktails and they were all great. I loved the Gin Flip! The food was also great. The fish and chips were delicious and the carne asada tacos!  We will definitely return!\n",
      "Good food and great prices!   Sakura has great lunch specials. They have lunch specials for their Chinese entrees and for their sushi. They have deals for sushi combos for dinner as well. The entrees and the sushi I've had from here have been good so far. Good portion sizes and quick service.   They are BYOB like many of the other places in Chinatown. They also deliver  and that is where my issues with this place lie. I use to order delivery from them often and 4/5 times my order was incorrect. I do enjoy their food  but I will not be placing any delivery orders from them.\n",
      "Duck Toungue and them pork soup dumplings. The two things that caught my attention. It definitely sparked my curiosity enough to compel me to walk through their doors.  When opportunity knocks   I'm that guy that doesn't think twice about it. Jump right in and tell my friends all about it afterwards. Doesn't make sense to keep eating chicken fingers and fried potato sticks for the rest of your one chance life. Besides it's my first time getting in bed with duck tongue and pork soup dumplings.  Anyways   the food.  Duck Tongue - WOW!!! This was a definitely a good experience. I love the flavor and the texture. Ginger sauce and the delicate flavor of the tongue meat is sublime. I could see myself ordering this dish again.  Beef Tripe: I love a good beef tripe. Their version is spicy and definitely yummy. I would order this again.  Shanghai Shumai: Its pretty good   wonton and sweet sticky rice have some good flavors. Great vegetarian option   but not my favorite.  Mini Wonton In Spicy Sauce: This is another one of their winner dishes as well. I love the flavors  it's definitely very vibrant. Only flaw   the wonton wrap is a little under done.   Pork Soup Dumplings: Yasssssss!! I would definitely order this over and over and over again. Use caution tho  the soup in the dumpling is super heated. It'll literally destroy your mouth if you don't eat it properly.   Service was pretty good. The staff was extra attentive. I would definitely come back and share some dimsum with a friend. Thank you for reading my review. I hope this helps. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!\n",
      "This was a nice restaurant on the corner of 10th and Race. The atmosphere is open with bright colors. For the appetizers  we got the scallion pancake which was very good and the pork fried dumplings which were not the best but edible. For the main dishes we split the stir fried beef udon and  the snow pea leaves with shrimp and scallop. Both were decent but again nothing special. Our wait staff were pretty quick and Prices are very similar to other places in Chinatown. Overall Sakura was decent but does not stand out at all in Chinatown. Would like to go back and check out some of their other dishes.\n",
      "Disappointed!!! A hot pot for almost $50  and there's not even enough to for two people. Doesn't worth. They even forgot my order made me wait so long\n",
      "\n",
      "one word: delish!  BYOB  great for groups and very satisfying food!  Big fan of the chilly fish and soup dumplings.\n",
      "Great service and even had multiple servers come to our table to ensure we were doing well. Food was great and reasonably priced. They were a little skeptical about the 10% yelp offer though  but it worked :)\n",
      "WHY ARE ALL DIM SUM PLACES THE SAME!?!? I don't mean in terms of food but the service! Honestly the food was alright thats why I am not giving this place a one star review  but my heavenly goodness to all that is holy on earth this place probably was one of the rudest and worst service. First problem was when we say down one of the waiter spoke to me in Chinese in which I understand that I am Asian American  but do not assume I am Chinese because I am actually Vietnamese. So the waiter started to speak to us in Chinese when we said  \\ Oh we're not  Chinese\\\" and which she started to speak english. I don't understand why almost all places in Chinatown dose this. There are places that are Vietnamese  Korean and even Malaysian owned and whenever I order or walk in they speak to me in english but I ONLY ALWAYS have this problem when i go to a Chinese place. But anyways  the second problem was when we walked in and sat down a different waiter gave us hot tea which was bomb by the way don't get me wrong  but forgot to bring us cold ice water. So I asked not making a big deal out of it. We waited for a solid 10 minutes before I could get the attention from another waiter and asked for cold water again. It wasn't even that busy  probably 7 other tables  so I don't understand why it took so long. But that wasn't the biggest deal so I let it go. The biggest problem of the night was when I was about to pay. I walked up and asked for a check and paid with my credit card you know just a usual transaction. When I was about to put tip  I gave a tip of $4.15 which was about 10% - 12% tip. The waiter POINTED to the tip and said  \\\"This is the tip.\\\" I was so heated  but kept my cool. The owner was standing right in front of us and said  \\\"This is the minimum tip\\\" which was like $6.48 I think. UHM HELLO!?!?!?  First off  you should be lucky I gave you tip in the first place with the subpar service and you have the nerve to tell me how to tip??? GET OUT OF MY FACE LADY. I said  \\\"Do I have to leave that tip?\\\" making a smart remark. She then asked me \\\" Do you eat out a lot?\\\" Uhh... yes i actually do for a matter a fact so you can go and kick rocks lady. I said \\\" Yes i do actually.\\\" She then pointed to the minimum tip and I said  \\\"Well it's not against the law for me to leave any tip.\\\" I signed my name and walked away. Overall  the food was subpar but the service was HORRIBLE! I suggest going to eat somewhere else like Spice C or maybe Bonchon or anywhere else in Chinatown because this place is a disgrace for a business. Save your money and spend it somewhere else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They have just about everything  hot noodle soups (my favorite) sushi  dim sum  and traditional Chinese dishes like general tao. Nice big menu and so far everything I have ordered is very tasty. I would try the dumplings  hot seafood noodle soup  and clam appetizer. The prices are good  you will leave full and happy. Service is fast and consistent  the servers always make sure you have plenty of water. The food comes out fast so I suggest you order your appetizer and wait before ordering your main course.\n",
      "Me  wifey and mom in law decided on Bellini Grill for restaurant week. The best part: the ambiance. The ceiling is a complete painting of lumpy angel babies which is somehow romantic and relaxing. It's extremely intimate with tables that boxed in some customers so you get a booty in your face as someone is getting up.  The not so best part: the food. Based off of the restaurant week menu everything was ok but something had to be off. Chicken parm was good....spaghetti wasn't chewable. Crab ravioli got the potential...gross green pea sauce alllll over my ravioli. The service wasn't horrible nor was the drinks. BUT I want to bust a grub at a restaurant so probably won't be going back.\n",
      "\n",
      "We came here on a Saturday after Christmas with a party of 12 at 8:00PM.  The place was jumpin'....25-35 year old crowd.  Reservations on a Saturday are definitely a must!  Small byob with murals on the walls and Sistinesque mural on the ceiling.  We arrived early and it was way too crowded to be seated so we had drinks at a bar a few blocks away.  The hostess was a sweetie.  She took 3 of our bottles and held them on the side so we didn't have to lug them around.  When we came back the bottles were on the table with the rest of our party.  You can usually tell how a restaurant is going to be by the complimentary bread and butter  which in this case was OK.  I had the antipasta as an appetizer and it was OK.  The marinated eggplant was interesting though.  Everyone enjoyed that.  The olives lacked taste... As an entrée I had the fettucini con gamberetti  ($15.95)  which was rock shrimp sautéed in a light cognac blush sauce.  Fettucini is a hard dish to cook and not many restaurants master it so I'm trepidatious in ordering it.  They did a pretty good job on it.  My only complaint is that it was a little too dry....definitely needed some moisture.  The shrimp got lost in the perfectly cooked pasta...meaning they were quite small.   I tried my mate's linguine con vongole which was pretty good.  Soooo all in all I would definitely say that this restaurant is OK.  I would definitely return to try other dishes.\n",
      "This place was fantastic for our large group (21 people). They helped us set up a customized prix fixe menu for our group which made ordering and check paying a breeze. The price point was lower than other BYOs I found in Philly. Our waiter  Brian  was awesome  attentive  patient  and funny. Even better  after we finished the meal  we were kind of mingling around our little corner of the restaurant  finishing our drinks  and the staff were kind enough to let us leave at our own pace. Thanks for a great birthday night!\n",
      "I came here a few weeks ago with some friends. Overall  I thought the food was ok  but I felt that it just wasn't worth the price. Don't get me wrong  I know that BYOBs tend to charge a little more because they have to make up for the fact that they're not making money off of alcohol sales  but paying $30 for my entree just felt like a rip off.   I ordered their seafood pasta special which included large scallops  shrimp  and clams over a bed of pasta. It tasted pretty good  but I've had better. Also  even though it feels awkward  it would have helped if I would have asked how much the specials were because they were around $10 more than several of the other regular menu items I was considering  and had I known this in advance  maybe I would have been more satisfied with my meal.   The friends I was with felt the same way about the place. Average tasting food and a bit pricey. One of my friends got the salmon special (around $30)  and my other friend ordered the crab ravioli. We enjoyed the dining experience -- the waiter was very friendly  and we got a nice table by the window--but I don't think we'll be coming back.\n",
      "Should be rated much higher than 3 stars! Hopefully my review helps...great food  wine and service. Our waiter manager was exceptional. I highly recommend Bellini.\n",
      "The one star I am giving is for our waiters wonderful service and their good bread. The lack of stars is mainly directed towards the way we were treated by the owner and the extremely overpriced corking fee of $240 (for having a few $9 bottles of wine!). My friends and I have been coming to Bellini for the past 4 years to celebrate various birthdays and special occasions because of their wonderful accommodation with larger parties  good food  and allowing us to bring our own bottles. This last visit was expected to be just like any other  until we were abruptly greeted by the owner at the door to tell us this is not a byob and hasn't been for the last 3 years (we've never heard this before). He continues to tell us we will be charged a $20 corking fee PER PERSON  which is insane. Not only that  but after waiting 40 minutes for our reserved table  as soon as we sat down  the owner came to our table to not greet us and apologize for the long wait  but instead to rudely tell us at this is a fine dining restaurant and to not get rowdy. I would certainly not classify this restaurant as fine dining. The food was not as good as it has been in previous years either. It was very disappointing to say the least to be treated this way. It's a shame  but we won't be returning.\n",
      "Dont come here for a group formal! The ambiance was nice and the staff was really great  but the food  at least from the set course  was absolutely terrible. The bread was less then mediocre  we all had caesar salads of varying amounts different vegetables put in them and the main courses were just flat out disappointing. The cod I got tasted like nothing and though the staff was quick and happy to re-season it  most people did not enjoy their meals at all. The only decent thing was the dessert but even that was just okay.\n",
      "Restaurant Week trial  it was ok. Nothing stood out  nothing was absolutely terrible. I would not return  there are just to many places to visit.  Service was back-asswards  appetizers came out first  then they brought out the salads. Entree was subpar  dessert was nice. One and Done.\n",
      "This is my go to place with girls for dinner at a BYOB before going out for the night. We can usually always get a reservation  even for a group. They are so nice and the service is always really great. The food can be hit or miss  sometimes I have had the best food ever and sometimes it has just been ok. However  I keep going back. Most of their desserts are really good also. Only problem is when I leave I am so full. I recommend it.\n",
      "I came after running the Philadelphia Marathon last weekend.  Ehhhhh  not sure of this place.  I sat at the bar  and even though it wasn't busy by any means  it still took at least 5 minutes to get a freakin menu (and there were 2 people in and out of the bar).  I finally got a menu and it took a good 10 minutes just to order.  The bar tender kept skipping over me it felt like  even when I tried to get his attention.  I'm ordering food and alcohol  so come on.    I got the burger and fries because it seemed like good post running food.  I asked for my meat well done because I like my meat killed  it came out still a little pink.  Food was ok but not anything that stuck out.  Definitely better places in Philadelphia to go to\n",
      "Last night I died and went to Gastro heaven.  Venturing in from the suburbs  we picked Ladder 15 for dinner.  I could not believe the menu.  Wonderful combinations  unusual ingredients and all served in an extremely cool venue.  The only reason I didn't give it the 5* was because the flyers game was on and  althought it wasn't packed  the noise was deafening.  'Nuff about my complaining.   When I saw the ingredients in the Steak tartare  I had to try it because I knew whoever devised the recipe knew what they were doing.  It was truly the best I've eaten in years and the Cognac and the raw quail's egg were like gifts to the palette.   Mind you  if I had known just how good it was going to be  I think I would have ordered another one for my entree.  Instead I ordered the Potato & Goat Cheese cigars and a Roasted beet salad.  Both outstanding and I was glad to be able to congratulate David when he stopped by the table to chat. My partner had the Rabbit Quesadilla  which was flavorful without being gamey.  He ordered the Burger 15 and I have to say this must have been one of the best burgers I've tasted  topped off with red wine marinated mushrooms  red onions and a tender short rib. I don't get why Ansill features marrow so prevalently on the menu.  I had never tried it and was curious.  I found it to be gelatinous and bland.  Maybe I'm missing something. Contrary to the experiences of others  the service was fine. It was a 30 something crowd and tons of people on here have complained about their attitude.  However  their attitude  actual or perceived  would not prevent me for going back to try more items from this outstanding menu at this fab Gastro-pub.\n",
      "So I went to Ladder 15 after reading an article on Serious Eats about their Burger 15. Ribs and marrow on a burger? Sign me up. And of course  I've not a clue coming to this place so as a habit  I come to my trusty Yelp site to find out the drill. Seems like everybody has a story about this place on a negative note. I guess it's a blessing for me to not have been here when the chef was different or when it was its former self  because genuinely I did like the place.  I liked the firehouse/banker/lodge theme  I liked the hard wood floor and the black leather booths  I liked clean and roomy bathrooms and most of all  I liked the food. Given  I've only been here once and I only brought one friend and we're both not really that hungry Plus  the items on the menu is in the \\trendy restaurant\\\" price range and it doesn't make me feel like ordering everything on the menu but what we had was solid.   The truffle fries were the best one I've had yet. Unlike the other ones  the flavor of the truffle really came through and it was awesome with the truffle mayo/tartar sauce  any acid/ketchup would have killed the flavor. Chicken Wings were also awe inspiring  you'd know it from the first bite. It's tender but lightly crispy with a sweetness from the caramelization  the juiciness from the meat  plus the creaminess of the avocado puree  the spiciness of hot sauce and the aroma from the green onion and crunchy sprouts on top. It's heaven in one bite.  Burger 15 was also great. I was calling it the ribs and marrow burger the whole time because I like the idea of having that. Build on a brioche bun  the burger patty is topped by a ragu of tender ribs meat and bone marrow with small cube of mushrooms to add a welcome toothy texture  and some onions for extra flavor. It's one of the juiciest burgers I've had yet and in a good way. Though I have to say the bottom brioche slice wasn't ready to handle all that bootiliciousness and became a bit soggy. Overall  It's interesting and well thought out food.  The staff was friendly enough and my waitress attentive enough  refilling my lemonade when I'm barely halfway done. Although I wished that she would have warned me about the fries that comes with the burger  since it's not printed on the menu. I wouldn't have ordered another bowl of fries and gone for the fried cauliflower. The prix is also not printed on the Prix Fixe menu  have I known about that I might have ordered that instead. So there a re a few front of the house thing that could be better. It could be crowded in here and the crowd could be a bit obnoxious. But since I like the place and the food  I'll bring a few friends back and do it all over again.\"\n",
      "I REALLY wanted to like this place  but it was not meant to be.  I ended up at Ladder 15 for a Friday night dinner and drinks as part of a group of four  and things got off to a great start.  We wandered in around 8:15 and were promptly seated.  The decor was extremely cool  and our booth seats and chairs were comfy enough to warrant comments.  The noise level and crowd were energetic  but not overwhelming.  The service through the evening can best be described as friendly but poor.  A first glance at the beer list looked promising with ~10 unique selections.  However  closer inquiry would reveal that they were out of two beers  two of the remaining 8 were fruit wheat beers  one of the remaining 6 was also a wheat beer  and so on...  Everyone in our group ended up settling for something less than thrilling.  The food menu led to similar high hopes with inspiration from so many different styles of cuisine - Korean tacos  enchiladas  burgers  yes please!  I even said \\Wow  this menu is so diverse that I will be really impressed if they execute it well.\\\"  I was not to be impressed on that night.  Nothing tasted bad  but nothing was great.  Our table had the aforementioned Korean tacos and enchiladas  as well as a sad little chicken sandwich  and a salad of \\\"field greens with pepitos  cider vinaigrette and roasted chicken\\\" that translated into a $13 plate of bitter greens with 8 pumpkin seeds  and approximately 3 oz. of cold shredded chicken doused in a very tart dressing.  Fortunately  we also shared a basket of truffle fries that stood out as the tastiest part of the evening.  They also prevented us all from leaving hungry  as the portions of the meals were quite small.  Again - I REALLY wanted to like Ladder 15.  In fact  the atmosphere was almost cool enough to bump them up to 3 stars.  However  towards the end of our meal  I discovered the \\\"atmosphere\\\" included a giant  sharp bolt sticking out of one of our table's legs at precisely knee height.  When I told our waitress what happened (and asked for extra napkins to use for the bleeding)  she was fully unconcerned.\"\n",
      "I was unaware of the no one under 23 rule until reading these reviews  and by the bros who were milling around the floor I don't think the age thing helps class the joint up! The drink I ordered was good  and I have previously eaten here - the plates are small but flavorful. I would like to give the place more stars  but the atmosphere is just - ugh!\n",
      "Ah-mazing food! Stopped by here for a quick dinner before a show at the Academy of Music and were quite pleasantly surprised by the amazing food! Started with the guacamole  which was freshly made and not from a jar. Then the tuna tartare - easily one of the best I've ever had. Large chunks of fresh red tuna in a delicious sauce  served with wontons. Would've been happy to stop there but then the Brussel sprouts came. Holy Molly! They are by far the best I have ever had and I make them myself - theirs put mine to shame! We didn't bother to have a drink  but the food will not disappoint. Also  our server was exceptional and another reason to go back.\n",
      "Pricey drinks  great music. Really really loud on Friday and Saturday nights. The bar is huge and great location in center city. It's mostly open space with very few high top tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disclaimer: Only came here to drink at night.  Though as soon as I got on this page  a big photo of splooge on the bathroom wall popped up and  well  a place that inspires people to splooge in the bathroom just can't be all bad.  This is definitely a \\new\\\" place in Philadelphia.  New meaning it didn't exist when I lived here back in 2009.  Around $10 a drink  loud  no dance floor.  Really just a room full of white people yelling at each other over the music.  Not an attractive crowd either.  So expect to splooge alone in the bathroom.\"\n",
      "Service was good. Food was good. Atmosphere was decent.  Our server was very attentive and had our drinks beers filled. They had fried cauliflower which was awesome. I also had a portobello and eggplant pressed sandwich was was delicious. It was just warm and loud in there. It is a trendy happy hour bar but I was sweating indoors : \n",
      "Not bad but not great. Presumably one of the better places you'll find in manayunk. Pretty average though. The servers are usually extremely slow. The food is average. Every time we go  it's always just been ok. Last experience I had was not so pleasant. Server brought over queso fundido and dropped a plate into it(bottom side facing cheese). Totally disgusting and unsanitary! Didn't even offer to bring us a new one which I thought to be extremely unprofessional. Steak tips were also cold when they came to us. Empanadas are dry and could have some potential if they added some cheese or mixed it up a bit and did cheese  and chicken.\n",
      "Revisited Adobe after not eating here for a few years. Used to be so good. But now ....In a word? Awful. We got there around 8 ish on a Saturday night and the place was pretty busy. We were taken to the last table in the farthest corner of the restaurant....deeeeep in the bowels. It was a long walk. Red flag. Our server showed up more than 5 minutes after we were seated to take drink order. 2nd flag. We were smart enough to order a few apps at this point - had a feeling. Drinks came out fairly quickly - app and soup sampler not long after that. The soups were cold (3rd flag).  Apologies and new soups arrived. They were really good - best part of entire meal. Loooong after we finish the starters  entrees appear. My favorite veggie enchiladas were ......ick. I managed to eat a bit. What used to be a delicious creamy fresh veggie dish was now a dry tasteless blob. And the dried out old tasting rice did not help. The crusted over black beans were dreadful. Loooong after we have enough of entrees  as we sit and stare at our plates and each other  and watch our server sweep the entire area nearby  completely ignoring us  we realize we are still hungry and want dessert. Big mistake. Server eventually finishes housekeeping and takes order. AND gets snippy when we express dismay about the wait. It took so long to get dessert  I wanted to just cancel and get the hell out of there already  but our server was nowhere to be seen and since we were seated in the outback  no one else was around either. Eventually arrives and it is  well  a melted mess. We ate it and it was actually pretty good. By the time we get the check it was fairly empty so don't really understand why it took so long to get service. I could have gone and looked for someone to complain to  but I kind of wanted to see how it all played out. Not good as it turns out.  Adobe Cafe  what happened to you?\n",
      "Adobe Cafe rocks! Not only is it within walking distace from my house (which is very handy after a pitcher of mango margaritas) but it also has great food to match! I've had a number of the entrees but the two that stand out in my head are the steak and shrimp fajitas (tasty seasoning on the meat) and the fish tacos. The best thing about the fish tacos is that the fish isn't fried. It's perfectly seasoned and delicious and even though I couldn't finish my last taco I made sure to eat the rest of the fish :)   The banana ice cream dessert concoction was BANANAS!  One and only complaint - the waitstaff tends not to be the friendliest  but the food and drinks make up for that.\n",
      "OK neighborhood bar with decent Southwestern style food.  A tiny bit dirty  but I've never gotten sick here  so I guess the kitchen is clean enough.  Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here  but it is OK.  Used to come here with my buddies for beers before after jam sessions at East Side Studios down on Umbria.\n",
      "My wife and I visit Adobe fairly frequently and we always enjoy it. It's located on a side street that runs parallel to Ridge in Roxborough and there is a municipal (read: free) parking lot right across the street  which makes visiting very convenient.   The restaurant is located in a large  meandering structure - it feels like an amalgamation of previously independent row houses - but it has a cozy sort of feel. We are always seated promptly and brought homemade chips and salsa immediately.   Even though we are not vegetarian  we always get the \\beef\\\" seitan tips as an appetizer. I highly recommend them. I usually get the fajitas and find them to be pretty good. Tonight  I requested the \\\"meat\\\" from the seitan tips in my fajitas (even though this is not on the menu) and they were nice enough to oblige. It was really good.  Overall  this is a nice  casual place to catch up for a low-key dinner.  Likes: parking  food  Fiesta Night (Monday &amp  Tuesday - 2 entrees and a pitcher of beer/bottle of wine for $30)  Dislikes: House Margarita (that I think is on tap [?])\"\n",
      "I give an A for effort. The vegetarian/vegan menu is extensive and creative-sounding. I was very excited to try this place for quite some time but the execution was totally off.  One  the entrance to the restaurant is unclear. There's a door to a private residence right in the middle of the building and it took me a while to realize you have to go through the side patio to enter. Very confusing.  Once we entered  we were greeted by that overwhelming dirty  wet rag smell that less than fastidiously clean restaurants have. Our menus reeked too. Not appetizing.  The free chips and salsa were tasty and the staff was accommodating of our baby with a high chair and plastic cup if water.   My husband and I ordered seitan wings to share and the seitan kebabs and veggie combo as entrees. The wings were just warm seitan in sauce--not fried or crisp in any way like wings should be. This is not a vegan problem (I've had deliciously crisp vegan wings)  this is a cooking one. The vegan ranch was inedible  completely foul. I actually gagged.   The kebabs were nicely seared and seasoned but everything else ranged from flavorless to gross. The rice had canned veggies in it  the cheese in my enchilada wasn't melted  the potato flauta was burnt. The house margarita was disgustingly like cough syrup.   All told  we spent $60 bucks on our meal plus tip and I felt like I've had more authentic and flavorful tex mex at chipotle or even Taco Bell. I was super hungry upon entering but basically ate chips and salsa because I found most of the food inedible.   I truly appreciate so many veg offerings but the kitchen needs to learn how to cook and this place needs a deep clean. The kebabs were nice but for the price and nasty smell and icky interior (10 TVs playing infomercials!)  I just can't recommend this place. Very disappointing.\n",
      "I've been to the Adobe Cafe a handful of times  and its always been good  so Saturday night we decided to got there for a late dinner (around 9:00).    Overall  service was terrible  though the food was good.  It took 5 minutes for someone to seat us.  There was no one in sight when we walked in.  Then  once we were finally seated  there was anohter 5-10 minutes before we were greeted by our waitress.  Water was another 10 minutes.  Our waitress took our drink order  and it wasn't until 10 minutes later that she asked us for our food order.  At one point  we asked for more water (which we later learned was at a station right behind our table)  and she said \\sure  I'll go get it\\\"  and never returned.  We finally had to ask the busboy for water.   Food was good  but was really overshadowed by the lack of service.  I will also say that the Jerk grilled calamari was really fabulous.  I was nervous to try it  but I wanted more when I was done - I don't think the portion was big enough.   I was going to give 3 stars because of the food and previous good experiences  but then I remembered how crazy-loud the room was.  It just added to the bad experience.  I couldn't hear across the table half of the time we were there.  Oh  and a comment on the \\\"ample free parking\\\" across the street.  It looks like with the new bar there (Mcgillicuddy's or something)  the parking lot was completely full.  We had to drive around the block a few times looking for parking.  We should have taken that as a sign to stay home...\"\n",
      "I love the previous review. . . straight and to the point.  They do have the most extensive vegan menu I've seen in a Mexican restaurant  I would give them half a star just for that if it were possible.  Redux:  Appearance/decor: * * * Pretty front and patio  cluttered heavy interior  bendy plstic chairs and tables outside.  Service: * * * * Good  quick  attentive  unintrusive. Point off for the host.  Menu: * * Too long.  Booklike. Weak appetizer section.  No sides.  Narrow price range for entrees--reasonable for some items  pricey for others.  Food: * * * Good for what it was trying to do. Points off for black beans  corn tortillas  salsa  portobellos.  Good steak  guacamole.  Drinks: * * Decent margaritas.  From a mix  weak. Bonus on price.  Experience: * * *  Overall pleasant  but I won't frequent the joint.  Definitely worth checking out as I have high standards for Mexican.  Good family place.  The outdoor patio is very pretty  if somewhat echoing.  The interior was full of kitsch and other Mexican-themed decor: neither impressive nor bland.  There was no music  but the waiters did start up an attractive wall fountain which created much-needed  white noise.    The service was good  and efficient.  A point off to the host for failing to bring menus when he seated us.  Even though there were only three tables seated besides our own  there was always someone nearby to respond to requests.  We went to sit outside on a hot day and have a bite to eat with our margaritas.  They advertised a margarita bar  so I assumed they would specialize in them.  The margarita mixer list was impressive  but the corresponding appetizer list was somewhat lacking.  We split a combination platter of fajitas with portobello and steak.  We asked for a corn tortilla sub  and received three tortillas: not quite sufficient for the generous portions.  However  they did give us a free refill on request.  The food was underwhelming.  The margaritas were also a little disappointing.  Tortillas were warm  but a little dry and cracking.  Black beans were totally unseasoned. Steak was very tasty and moist.  Green peppers and onions were tasty and sauteed well.  The portobellos were a total miss--they were marinated in worcester/soy and clashed with every other flavor.  The condiments were good  and decent portions  but they were all crammed on a tiny little plate--cheese  guacamole  sour cream  pico de gallo.  The margaritas were served in generous portions at a good price ($18/pitcher)  but that was the best part.  We went with the traditional because none of the other mixers looked like they might be sour.  They tasted like they were straight from a mix  and they were pretty weak.  After finishing a pitcher between two of us  I had a light buzz  and I'm not a drinker.    Overall  it was good  but I probably won't take the trip up to Roxborough again  so I gave it three stars.\n",
      "Love this place!  The food has always been delicious and ample.  They also have plenty of vegetarian options to choose from.  My favorite has to be the BBQ duck burrito  which is so delicious and so big  that I usually can't finish it.   I used to live in Roxborough and I have truly missed this place since I moved to South Philly  but recently while I was walking my dog  I came across a sign on a vacant storefront on Passyunk stating that an Adobe Cafe will be opening up soon!  I can't tell you how excited I was  since this is just a couple blocks away from my home!\n",
      "A hidden gem in this area. Great service  delicious food  and lots of vegan options.   I came with a group of friends. I don't eat cheese  my other two friends are vegan  and we wanted some margaritas. They accommodated everything and had quite a list of margarita flavor options.   The tacos were delicious. I got the al pastor  and the pineapple was sweet. The tacos also come with a little salsa  guacamole  and beans and rice.   The best part of the meal was likely the chips and salsa they give you for free. The salsa is so fresh and deliciously spiced.  The margaritas were good but a little too sweet and not strong enough for us (subjective). Overall an great restaurant and would definitely go back!\n",
      "Food was well prepared and fresh. I had the oso bucco ravioli. The ravioli were definitely homemade  they were a little light on the filling which made them less flavourful then they should have been. Service was great   the place was so loud the wait staff had a hard time hearing us unless we raised our voice. Good place. Extremely tiny and tables are jammed in. Not recommended for a date night. With so many great places to eat in this neighborhood the only thing that would bring me back is the fact it's bring your own bottle. Otherwise I know I could find something as good or better with less noise  a tad more elbow room  and more flavor\n",
      "crappy restarurant with awful service and rude waiter. if you are looking for a GOOD BYO italian restaurant  go to La Baia on 17th and Lombard!\n",
      "I frequent the Rittenhouse Square area often as an old friend runs a bar down the street  and have passed Porcini's many times. Having had a date last Saturday  I thought it would have been a good opportunity to try it out.  The layout of the restaurant left some to be desired  as the host stand is at the back  and the place is very small save for the upstairs  but they were able to sit us almost immediately in the upstairs dining room which was small  yet charming  and slightly more roomy. A gentleman who I am guessing was the co-owner was very friendly and ensured our 8:00 reservation was filled and the wine poured. The service wasn't slow  though awkward. It seemed that our server was there when we didn't need her  yet not there when we did  though she had a very friendly demeanor and was not rushing us in the least. The food was delicious  though a few things stood out to me as peculiar  hence the 4 stars instead of 5. This was a legit Italian restaurant  yet they had ravioli as an antipasto. Anybody who knows Italian knows this means \\before\\\" the pasta  not the pasta itself. Secondly  the bread  which was very good  came with butter  and not Olive Oil. Again  this was an Italian restaurant  not an Applebee's.  For our appetizer we ordered eggplant  which was okay. Was sliced a bit too thin  though this may have been personal preference  but in doing so was masked by the (delicious) red gravy and (addictive) mozzarella  which was very fresh  so while I may not have been tasting the eggplant  I was tasting some very delicious flavors.  Our main courses came in due time afterwards  enough to let our eggplant digest  but not enough time to make us forget. I ordered the special  linguine in a light vodka cream sauce with salmon and capers  my date ordered the canneloni. Both were inspired. Not the gigantic portions known to most frequent Italian restaurant goers in Philadelphia  but just enough. The flavors were subtle  yet plentiful.  We did skip dessert in favor of coffee. I ordered a double espresso  my date a cappucino (I know  but she was cute  so it's okay). The waittress came out with a regular and double cappucino. Wasn't the end of the world  so I just enjoyed it  and it was good  but just speak up if you want an espresso.  Overall I recommend this place  mainly for the main courses  but am willing to go back and give it another shot and give Porcini's their 5th star. I hope I can!\"\n",
      "Came here with my girlfriend on a Monday night and took advantage of the Yelp coupon (which you should too).  Ambiance: Home-y but very small and cramped. Luckily it wasn't too busy on a Monday night. Can't imagine the place packed given it was already hard to hold a conversation given we could hear the other two tables talking around us (BYOB makes everyone a bit louder).  Service: There was one waiter and one busboy working and they had everything covered. Made solid food recommendations and were attentive. Our waiter was also extremely friendly.  Food: Solid italian food. Nothing out of this world  but good. We got a special appetizer - Italian Empanada...Sounds weird  but it was very flaky  delicious party in a slightly spicy marinara. Very delicious. My main entre was the beef osso bucco. The meat was delicious  but don't expect any bone marrow with this dish. My girlfriend ordered a fettucine special which was ok. Noodles were homemade  but the sauce was a little off.  All in all  a reasonably priced Italian BYOB. Just don't come expecting the absolute best italian food.\n",
      "Food is average  but the place is too cramped. The owners are also just not friendly. I was made to wait outside in the cold because somebody in my party arrived late despite having a reservation and nobody else in line.\n",
      "A great family run little BYOB with absolutely fantastic food and even better service. There is no better Italian in Philly. My Sicilian grandmother loved it  what more proof do you need?  Stop reading this and go there. Do it now.\n",
      "I've eaten at porcini two or three times now and it is totally tiny and cramped but I've never been disappointed with my meal. I would agree that it can be uncomfortable if it's too crowded but if you've been there before or if you've read these reviews then just know that's the case and expect it!  the food is always fresh and filling and the owner treats everyone like a regular. I would agree that you can do a cheaper BYO for sure  but I would definitely recommend it anyway.  It's certainly deserving of at the very least three stars across the board and if you hit it on the right night and it's not totally slammed it's 5 stars for sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "We eat out alot and had heard extremely good things about Porcini.  A pet peeve of ours is making us wait for table when there are a bunch in the room.  It was odd to have that happen  not a show stopper though.  They take their time throughout the meal (not TOO long  but it's a nice pace to let you talk with friends for an evening out).  Nice atmosphere. The food was very good  you will leave not too stuffed  but just right.  Homemade Ravioli are extremely good.  Worth the trip to try a new restaurant - be sure to bring Yelp's $20 coupon.  ENJOY!\n",
      "This is a great little BYO on Sansom  right down the street from Melograno.  Not sure how I've never been there  but armed with a bottle of white  stopped in for a Thursday night dinner.  We shared the octopus and calamari and appetizer which wasn't the best I've ever had  but it was cooked properly.  Bread with olive oil and ricotta was nice  but would be better if they warmed the bread.  I had the eggplant appetizer with a side of fettuccine for my entree.  It was really good  although their tomato sauce is a little on the salty side for my taste.  The eggplant was cooked really nicely though  and I ate the whole thing.    Service was great.  Our waitress was very attentive and everyone there was very friendly.  They must have a large room upstairs because there was a birthday party for 30 people up there.  The main dining area is tiny.\n",
      "do not eat here. my husband  two friends and i went out for restaurant week to marmont steakhouse on saturday  january 26  2013  our experience was horrific.  the four of us ordered the crab bisque soup for our first course  it was cold and we sent it back to be reheated.  my second course was the calamari it was bland  fried too hard and rubbery.  finally two ppl from our party ordered the lobster ravioli for an entree.  it was not lobster ravioli but beef. i asked our waiter and one other waiter to please double check with the chef because this is not lobster  i expressed that i have not eaten beef or pork since 1994  and that it would make me ill. they both came back separately and argued that it was in fact lobster. another party of maybe 6 ppl ordered the lobster ravioli  they had the same problem and sent their dishes back to the kitchen too.  the server finally came over after i'd eaten two of the ravioli to apologize for the kitchens error and telling us that was in fact beef.  i have been in the bathroom all day with diarrhea from the beef ravioli! the staff was very nonchalant about it and offered an insincere apology.\n",
      "I was looking for a restaurant in the city that offered a good steak at a reasonable cost.  I've been to the Capital Grill and I enjoy their beef as well as their service and decor  I just didn't want to spend $250.00 + for the 3 of us (call me cheap).  Not really knowing what to expect at the Marmont  we took a risk.    The Good: I have to say that the NY strip steaks and rib eye were very very good and cooked perfectly (medium rare and medium).  They were about 1-1/2 thick (forgot to bring my calipers) and well trimmed  very little fat was left. I would say the meat was prime  not choice.  We all enjoyed them as well as the fries which were cooked crisply as we requested.  the sauces were meh  why cover up the wonderful taste of the beef?  Service was good  prompt  and polite.     The Not So Good: The decor is awful.  The floor looks like painted OSB with the paint half worn off  the tables are painted plywood  lighting from K-Mart  and walls have a few giant old signs hanging on them.  The place is a visual dive. I felt like I was in a Tom Waits song.  How hard would it be to make it a nice warm and inviting space? I don't get it.   Want to make more money? Spend the 5K  it will pay off. But please find someone who knows what they are doing.  You serve delicious steaks  I'll bet your decorator doesn't do the cooking  so why ask the cook to decorate?  If you want great steaks for a good price  go here.  But if you are looking for a classy or trendy setting too  you may need to pay the extra 30% at a high end steak house.\n",
      "I am always skeptical of Restaurant Week... You never know what service or the food will be like but you go in with that in mind... WELL fellow Yelpers.. I must say that I was surprisingly blown away by both!   We had a reservation for 6 but at the last minute we had another guest join us. When I called the restaurant to make sure it was ok  the gentlemen was more than happy to add one to our reservation.  Upon arrival we headed to the bar to wait for the rest of our group to arrive.  Bar menu was great  they have a lot of bottled beers to choose from...no drafts.. weird..  The food was really good!  For restaurant week I never have my hopes set too high...ist that bad??  I started with the Ceasar Salad  then the Ribeye and for dessert I ordered the Chocolate cake.. Salad was yummy  steak was done to perfection!!  I was not at all pleased with the chocolate cake (i love cake) BUT my friends bread pudding was pretty tasty!    We will definitely return.  Our server Melissa was really sweet too!\n",
      "If I could rate them less than one star I would. I had the worst experience here. I felt discriminated against  disrespected  and attacked. The place was over crowded because they over sold tickets. We were asked to move from where we were standing because it would block the dancers from walking by. However  they brought out chairs from the back for other people to sit in that same exact spot. The second time we were asked to move because a couple wanted to sit behind us and couldn't see. A woman then turned a chair around and told one of my friends that the seat wasn't for her in a very rude tone. Next  two girls came in and stood directly in front of me which was also directly in front of the doorway where the dancers were supposed to enter  a server came to us and asked us to move again but said nothing to the two girls. We stated that we could not move where he wanted because then we would be blocking the view of the customers already standing there so he then asked us to move to the back of the bar where we would not be able to see anything. After that the rude woman (who told my friend the seat wasn't for her) had her husband tap my friend and ask could she switch places with me because she was too tall and blocking everyone's view. There was no room for us to switch spots so I said no and continued to try to watch the \\show.\\\"  He then tapped her again and asked did she want to sit down  she said no she was fine. He proceeded by pushing the chair into the back of her legs and forcing her to sit down. There was no staff around to assist us with these issues and there was hardly any room to try to find someone so we left before things got anymore out of hand. As we stood outside getting ready to leave a couple that lived next door overheard us talking about how disrespected we felt they chimed in and said that many of the people there are impolite and rude. I will never again in my life recommend nor visit this establishment.\"\n",
      "OH MY GOD! I started off dinner with the Crab Bisque which was amazing! It actually had big pieces of crap in it  something that you usually don't get because many restaurants are cheap when it comes to seafood. I had the Gourmet Cheesesteak sandwich and I think after all the cheesesteak sandwiches I've had in Philly this is by far the best! The sandwich is a mixture of sliced rib eye (very good) and their filet mignon angus beef. They top it with vidalia onions and Cooper American cheese  i seriously dont think anything else will top this. My wife ended up having the Filet Mignon and that was great also. She mentioned  \\oh man i forgot to ask for steak sauce\\\" but as soon as she cut into it the steak was so juicy she said it didn't even need any sauce. Also I really recommend the BubbleGum drink  it was a great mixture of alcohols and it was surprisingly very good.\"\n",
      "I invited 20 of my friends to Restaurant Week and we decided to go to Marmont.  None of us had gone for dinner before so we had no idea what to expect.    The first course was lobster bisque which was very filling and had a lot of meat and good flavor.  Second course I chose the baked brie.  It was absolutely delicious and probably my favorite course of the night.  Third was the 12 oz NY Strip Steak.  I had mine medium rare and it was perfect.  Some folks were looking for the A-1 sauce  but for me  I had just what I needed.  Another reviewer commented on the terrible mashed potatoes--agreed.  Last was I chose the chocolate cake.  It was difficult to eat (in the fridge too long?)  so it sort of gave the meal a poor finish.  The service was good.  We had 2 servers accomodate us for the large party.  They were very appreciative and worked well with us  and I will definitely be back.  Oh  I had the mangotini as well (they have a very nice bar)  but I could've used a LOT more liquor for the $8.50 price.  We all had a great time and again  I'm a fan!  Man that baked brie was amazing...\n",
      "Had dinner here last night  filet skewers were excellent.  Our dinners were ribeye and filet both were perfect  tasty  cooked to perfection  had great accompanying sauces of bernaise and bbq. Our waitress  Lisa  was very helpful  she knew all of their menu and helped us select terrific choices. Steaks were one of the best we have had  cud dos to the chef.  Can't wait to return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had the daily special  blackened ribeye I think it was  delicious steak  cooked and seasoned perfectly. Mashed potatoes were absolutely delicious. When I want a good steak  this would definitely be my choice. I haven't been able to find a better steak.\n",
      "I recently just celebrated my 23rd birthday at Marmont! I let the manager/owner know ahead of time how many guests were attending and they gave me an incredible deal on a two hour open bar. When I arrived they had a table sectioned off for my friends and I  the manager was extremely accomodating and distributed wrist bands to my friends who were participating in the open bar special. The staff there definitely went above and beyond in rolling out the red carpet. Nobody had to wait for service AT ALL. The DJ played nothing but good dance music that everyone enjoyed  which you could tell from the dance floor and the ambience was beautiful! Around midnight  the staff brought out a cake with my name on it which was delicious and each of my friends got to enjoy as well. Overall I have to say that this birthday party was THE best I've ever had  and it was all thanks to Marmont. I wasn't the only one who thoroughly enjoyed myself either! When the night ended and I thanked my friends for coming to help me celebrate each of them had great things to say about this venue!   Thanks to Marmont and it's staff for helping me celebrate my 23rd birthday party with style!\n",
      "I have been going to Sweet Freedom now for about 4-5 months...I first heard of them when they were featured on a Groupon deal. Being vegan  I was overjoyed to find a vegan bakery in center city  and I have never been disappointed in my many visits there!  My personal favorite is the creme sandwich cookies  of which they usually have 2-3 different varieties of. They are probably the best vegan cookies that I have ever had  and I have tried many.   It is my pleasure to support a locally owned small business that is doing its best to compete in a world that is dominated by corporate foods...and one that uses NO animal products in their baked goods. If people want to boycott Sweet Freedom because they perceive it as not being \\vegan\\\"  well it's your loss!\"\n",
      "Thank you! Thank you! To the person whose brainchild this was. As a mom  it's a rare treat to walk in any other bakery with your child who is GF DF and tell her to pick any treat she wants!!\n",
      "As a non-celiac/non-vegan  these baked goods just tasted super dry. Though I will say  for vegans and celiacs  this is probably the best they can do with regards to baked goods.  For now  I'll stick to my milk  eggs and glutenous foods. Bottomline  if you're vegan/celiac go here  everyone else just find a good regular bakery.\n",
      "I really like this place--hands-down the healthiest dessert fare in Philly. I'm vegan and gluten-free  so naturally I love it. My only complaint is that there isn't great vibe inside the shop--wish there were Pandora going or something. I think that would make a huge difference. Otherwise  highly recommend going for takeout and bringing to parties  events  or just your own kitchen.\n",
      "damn you  sweet freedom! why do you have to tempt me with your delicious goodness? (of course  it doesn't make it any easier that i received a gift card on my birthday from a very thoughtful mother.)   i decided to stray from my standby cookie sandwich (since my last one here wasn't that great) and delve into the world of cupcakes. bad idea because now all i do is dream of cupcakes. i've had the samoa and the german chocolate kinds because i'm a sucker for coconut. both are phenomenal but if i had to pick a la sophie's choice  i'd go with the samoa. i've been exercising all kinds of restraint to keep myself from going to sweet freedom daily to sample more cupcakes.\n",
      "Ohhhhh Sweet Freedom indeed!  I actually found Sweet Freedom online during my big lactose free wedding cake fiasco. (for financial reasons I couldn't use sweet freedom and will have a home baked little cake for myself to cut).   I met with one of the owners  Megan  who was FANTASTIC. She was very laid back and friendly as well as knowledgeable and helpful. She offered a ton of different options to us as far as size flavor and decoration. She had some great insight to even offer me should I not choose her and go with a regular bakery  regarding cross contamination etc that you have to deal with for food allergies. I also found it inpressive that she actually said hello to each and every customer that walked in on that busy saturday afternoon. I love that. I even got a chance to talk with the cake decorator  who was seriouslyjust as sweet as the cupcakes she decorates!!  I only had a chance to buy the caramel toffee cupcake  a chocolate cupcake  a cookie  a vanilla cupcake and a slice of tomato pie.  All fantastic  although I'm partial to the chocolate.  I'll be back soon...after the wedding so i don't have to worry about not fitting into my dress!!!! :) Hands down a great place for people with food allergies!!!!\n",
      "Great vegan  allergen free bakery  with both traditional and edgy goods.  They have a wide variety of treats -- doughnuts  cupcakes  cookies  and bars.  I had the chocolate cayenne lime cookie -- the cookies are thin and slightly crisp  which I guess is to be expected from an allergen free cookie. It was tasty and had a nice spicey bite.  Not bad for $1.65.  Also tried a sample of the chocolate chip cookie  which is not noteworthy (skip it) and the magic bar which was just okay.  They list out all their ingredients for those avoiding certain foods. I will probably be back for a cupcake -- I feel like icing is the real test for an allergen-free spot.  Don't expect \\normal\\\" treats  because that's not what they're about.\"\n",
      "It's fine  but not great. I wouldn't come back. Their sweets looked and tasted mediocre.\n",
      "If you have crazy allergies this is the place to be. I admit  I have celiac and dairy intolerance so I was pumped for this place. It's quite pricey and they don't use any preservatives so make sure you eat whatever you get quickly-learn from my mistake. If you're just gluten free and want something close to a real brownie  this isn't the place for you. But if you want vegan  dairy free  etc. then go here. It's not bad if you have all these restrictions\n",

      "Race Street Cafe is a great little bar/restaurant to have a casual meal and a great beer. It's always got great specials on the chalkboard and new beers on tap and the service is usually spot on.   However  if you're coming with a large group  be prepared to wait. They do allow you to call ahead and order food and I highly recommend it if you're going for lunch and only have an hour to get back to work!  Special Note: They have a wood-burning stove inside which is so nice and cozy in the winter time and they are open-air in the summer time  along with outdoor seating!\n",
      "A 5 star rating would actually take something away from this place...I mean this is more like a cozy neighborhood pub than a cafe...and I like it that way.  That being said...expecting pub food and finding dishes that belong more in a fine back street bistro in Paris is indeed a welcome surprise. We started off with a couple of great tap beers that went very well with the calamari. The calamari was fried perfectly with cauliflower and jalapenos. It came with 2 sauces  one seemed like a chipotle mayo and the other was a little too sweet which is fine because the calamari didn't need any accompaniment. My wife had the poulet and I had the pork chop. Both were cooked perfectly and the poulet had a crisp skin and tender/juicy meat. The poulet came with roasted potatoes and the pork came with a mash of sweet potatoes  both came with haricot vert.  Great cozy and casual ambiance paired with friendly service make Race Street Cafe one of my new go to places in my hood.\n",
      "Great spot to get food and beers on a nice day  but outside seating is pretty limited.\n",

      "\n",
      "I was immediately a fan stepping into this cozy space. The food is generously portioned bar food   a few interesting specials  makes for a memorable night on a cold winter's night.\n",
      "This hidden gem has been one of my city-wide favorites for a few years now.  They always have an excellent rotating draught beer list. Franziskaner Hefe Weiss seems to be a permanent fixture  then they usually offer a few white options  a few dark options  and a few hoppier options (heart u hops). It pains me to see people in there drinking Lager bottles. What the hell's wrong with you morons?  They also have surprisingly amazing food. The calamari  the nachos  the burgers  and the hummus/baba ghanoush special are all excellent. I've probably been 20-30 times  usually mixing the aforementioned dishes with various specials and other menu items. Only once have I had anything sub par: the grilled veggie muffaletta sandwich. I had it once and it was fantastic. Next time  not so good.  Sauces are where they really shine though. The calamari and the fries both come with excellent dipping sauces  and the fries themselves are delicious too!  You really can't go wrong with any food choice there  and the atmosphere is a super cozy pub feel. I seriously wish I lived there. I've read a couple reviews saying the servers are rude  but I've never found that to be the case. They're very respectful  offer good beer recommendations (you can tell they've actually tried everything on tap and they appreciate good beer)  and maybe most importantly  even when it's packed they don't try to rush you out at all.\n",
      "I had heard many good things about this spot before  but finally checked it out recently. We sat outside on a cool summer day and really enjoyed the view of the Ben Franklin Bridge. If you're a beer snob like me  then this place is a must try. Large draft list with a ton of craft beers. For food I  had a side salad to start  which was fine. Nothing to write home analyst. However  as an entree i had the brisket sandwich  which was absolutely delicious. I will definitely check this place out again.\n",
      "This place easily has the potential of becoming 4 or 5 stars.  The location  the space  the outside seating area  the atmosphere....  Having just moved from Northern Liberties to Old City  I think of this place as almost being the North 3rd  or Abbaye  or Standard Tap of Old City  in other words  a casual gastro pub where you can go for delicious food at least once a week.  RSC still has a way to go in this category.  Interesting atmosphere - check  good music - check  relaxing vibe with local patrons - check. Friendly servers - check  delicious food? - they definitely have room to improve on this account.  To their defense  I am a vegetarian  so I am always judging a place by their vegetarian selections.  I tried their gnocchi and it was just ok.  It was lacking in flavor and just didn't wow me.    My friend had the veggie burger.  He asked that they not put tomatoes on it  but I guess that was interpreted as \\no toppings at all\\\"   He got what looked like a store bought garden burger with no toppings  in a pita  folded in half.  It was very strange and just not what I'd expect to have served at a place like this.  Note to the chef - take a trip over to Monks or the Belgian cafe and taste what an amazing veggie burger is like. Maybe I was expecting something delicious and homemade and more of a professional presentation?  The food isn't exactly cheap  so I guess I was just expecting more.  Unlike some of the other reviewers  I had no problems with the service.  I'll probably be back just because of the location and maybe just to drink  but if the food was better  I'd probably be there all the time.\"\n",

      "i was in DESPERATE need of gyros one day.  i decided to call in a take-out gyros salad because it would not have been appropriate (or kind to my coronary arteries) to ask for an entire box of gyros. the salad sizing was super confusing - mini  small  medium  large  etc. so i just asked the girl what would be an appropriate entree salad size. i think i ended up getting the small  which in all actuality was an appropriate amount of food.  the salad was fancypants. there was a boiled egg  some anchovies  feta cheese  tomatoes  cucumbers  pitted greek olives  and probably some other stuff that i can't exactly recall. it was topped by a generous portion of gyros that wasn't too oily per previous reviews. i ate most of the salad except the boiled egg and the anchovies (simple is better sometimes.) the only downside was the sodium content of that dish  i had a \\i'm coming  elizabeth!\\\" experience within an hour of eating the salad. my heart did recover  but i was super puffy the next day from all the salt.   nota bene: despite menupages saying effie's takes credit cards  YELP is right - effie's is CASH ONLY.  ******UPDATE - July 2013***** i received the following message from the owner. Please note that it DOES TAKE CREDIT CARDS at this time.  \\\"Hi  this is Effie Bouikidis from Effie's Restaurant  I'm sorry to bother you. I noticed that at the time of your visit we were not accepting credit cards  but that is not the case any longer. The reason I am messaging you about this is because your review shows up under our name when people are searching for restaurants  specifically the comment about not accepting credit cards. May I ask that you edit your review to correct the \\\"cash only\\\" comment? It would be greatly appreciated. I'm sorry for any inconvenience. Thank you very much! Join us sometime!\\\"\"\n",
      "Although we were thrilled with our seating in an small building behind the restaurant with the doors wide open in February  we were thrilled with the food that we were served. The beet salad  zucchini chips and seafood appetizers were all delicious. The lamp chops were cooked perfectly and the Effie's chicken was also a great entree choice.   Would definitely come back but in warmer weather!\n",
      "\n",
      "The zucchini chips alone warrant this restaurant the four stars. They're absolutely perfect! Much better than Estia's chips  which is up the street and much more expensive. Effie's is the quintessential neighborhood restaurant. Everyone that works there is friendly  the Effie's chicken is delicious  and in the summer  their roasted fish dishes are fantastic. Last night  I went with a group of about 9  and unfortunately  the server forgot a dish  and one guest received cold lamb. The place itself is starting to show a little age- it could definitely use some TLC. This cash only BYOB is a consistent  good meal.\n",
      "Average greek food. Nothing fancy  but healthy. Good service. Extra point for outdoor seating and BYOB.\n",
      "I had a group of 6 here for my birthday dinner on Friday.  We had a semi private round table upstairs - it really felt like we were in someone's living room.  A good thing  in my book.  The whole place is cozy and intimate.   I've been on a Greek food kick motivated by my recent visits to Kanella's  which is just down the street on Spruce St and 10th.  Of course  given the proximity and both being BYOBs  it's hard not to compare the two.  It always comes down to the food for me  and I think Effie's falls short here.  The food isn't as inspired or nuanced as Kanella's.  It could be due to the Cypriot regional influence (think middle Eastern) of Kanella's versus Effie's  which is more mainland Greek  but the food is less spiced  a bit bland and not presented in a way that's inspired.    I will say that our dinner table lingered for 2.5 hours and enjoyed many drinks over the span of several courses  and we never felt rushed or unwelcomed.   I think that speaks to the nature of the inviting atmosphere at Effie's.  Definitely a great place for romantic date.   I don't like giving 3 stars  because that is a concession to having an average experience - (and who wants to be average?) - but as mentioned above  Kanella's gives Effie's a run for it's money and they'd do well to step up their culinary game.\n",
      "Have been here with a group of friends  date nights  and lastly a family birthday dinner.  Always absolutely amazing!\n",
      "One of Philly's most enjoyable dining experiences.  Effie's doesn't look like much when you first walk in  but request to be seated in the courtyard or in the other dining room out back (an intimate & cozy dining room area with a fireplace) & you will be pleasantly surprised. It feels as though you've stepped out of Philly and into a small restaurant in the Greek countryside.  Great place for a dinner date.   The food is delicous  you will not be disappointed.\n",
      "Was there last weekend. We were seating in the alley street. Amazing food. Especially lamb chops they so good that worth every dollar. Authentic Greek coffee  and complimentary desert... definitely going back when I'm in town!\n",
      "We met another couple for dinner and they suggested Murph's based on a previous visit.  I'm always up for someplace new  but I was blown away with my dinner at this little unassuming bar in Fishtown.  A nice beer selection  I  had a Kona IPA and a Belgian from local St. Benjamin's  both were really good.    We ordered the Zucchini Blossoms and received three of them stuffed with pillows of ricotta with a thin batter and lightly fried.  A product of the season  here today and gone next week  these were totally worth it.  Also ordered the caprese salad  it came with an extra dollop of mozzarella cheese  drizzled with balsamic and oil.  Along with a piece of crusty bread  this was excellent.    As for entrees  my wife had the salmon wrapped in thin slices of zucchini and it really worked.  I had a pasta dish with an unpronounceable type of pasta that resembled small penne with a spicy sauce and pork cheeks  another hit.  This was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had and was cooked al dente.    Murph's is a great neighborhood gem and a must visit when in the area.\n",
      "Three and a half stars. You had me at \\hockey bar\\\" but lost me at \\\"Flyers.\\\" Totally bizarre for me to be drinking in enemy territory  but a good time was had... even on a non-Quizzo night. Attentive service for everyone while we chatted up our fellow barmates. Our bartender recommended the Washington Apple shots  which were not too sweet and an alright break from our beers. Extra kudos to her for trying to be my buddy's wingman after she misread the situation.  Bartender: \\\"So what brings you into town?\\\" Me  turning to pat my friend on back: \\\"It's my buddy's birthday this week.\\\" Bartender: \\\"Ohhhh.\\\" And unbeknownst to me  shoves her finger into her other hand's thumb/index ring in the international sign of getting it on. Friend  shaking his head in response to her: \\\"No  no.\\\" Me  slightly annoyed and still looking at my friend: \\\"Uh  yes... that's why I came up here!\\\" Bartender  winking: \\\"Better let her have what she wants!\\\" Me: \\\"Haha! Wait  what?\\\" Friend: \\\"Oh god  I'll explain later...\\\"  Yeah  I see myself being a regular here if I lived nearby  even with last decade's buttrock constantly cycling through the jukebox. Laid back and friendly atmosphere  and much less crowded than Johnny Brenda's.\"\n",
      "The pear and cheese pasta is the best pasta I've had in Philly  but maybe ever.  It's absolutely amazing.  Skip the Italian Market and just head here!\n",
      "\n",
      "Who would've thought that a divey Irish Pub would serve such great Italian pasta dishes!? My friends in Philly took me to this little covert spot of culinary perfection because they know I'm a big foodie.   As I walked in the interior had me thinking that they just served beer and standard bar food  but never judge a book by it's cover. After looking over the menu  my friends and I ordered the Lobster Ravioli with Cream Sauce  the Veal Tortellacci with Walnuts and Truffle Oil over Capocollo  and the Pear and Cheese Fiocchi with Parmigigiano Cream and Honey to share for the table.  Everything was divine. So good I was sopping up each sauce with their delcious fresh baked bread. They also have a fabulous wine selection  and offer pairings for each of their dishes.   I must say Murph's is one of Philadelphia's best kept secrets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cozy place  reasonable prices  decent crowd.  Outside area small but okay to stand around in (no tables  at least last time I was there).  Currently working on being redesigned (had a few beers and helped the owner paint some slabs - friendly staff!)\n",
      "Its the first place I ever got drunk (Fun Times) so I have to give it a 5 lol its a little small but on a Friday Saturday who cares! Its fun nice people hot bar tenders  ) and a great place just to have fun alot of my best drunk story's start with \\So I left murphs\\\" lol\"\n",
      "Phenomenal.  Fantastic authentic Italian food in an Irish bar.  Had the stuffed eggplant  which was very good.  My wife had the best lobster ravioli I have ever tasted and my daughters gnocchi was too die for.  The dessert knocked it out of the park.  This place is a must!\n",
      "very chill atmosphere  good selection of micro brews  2 dollar pbrs  great place to hang  live music.  Not much space however  tough to relax if its busy\n",
      "Kung fu tea is a hit or miss. Sometimes they make delicious drinks  other times the tea is unsatisfactory. Regardless  the bubble tea on the good days is the best in chinatown. The classic kung fu milk tea is usually delicious (and a lot better than Tea Do's). The interior is very modern  hip  and Asian inspired.   Kung fun tea is a great place to chill with friends  play some jenga  and sip on tasty milk tea.\n",
      "I visited this place after a year or so. Service as well as quality of the drinks served has improved considerably.  Though there are nicer places in the very same block to choose from.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is one of my favorite places to go after lunch dinner. They are known for their bubble teas. My favorite thing about this place is that you can choose how much sugar you want in your drink! This is a huge plus  making your drink slightly less healthy. I also like how their drinks comes with jelly.\n",
      "Tea is good. I always get half sugar since the regular sugar amount is waaaaayyyy too much. Not trying to get diabetes here. Plus  the boba seems to have been soaked(?) in sugar water or syrup because when you bite into it  it's pretty sweet. Another reason to want to lower the sugar of the tea.   Customer service: a couple times I went I got the younger female who gave me an attitude when I asked about the buy one get one free special that day. there's also an older woman who is so sweet and always clarifies your order twice to make sure she gets it right.   TL DR: Tea is good. A little too sweet so I always half it. Boba is sweet. Customer service is okay for a tea place. Would recommend to friends.\n",
      "The place is a social at atmosphere with many tables to sit. I would  come here with friends and enjoy a nice conversation or play table games that they provide.   I usually get the mango green tea and it's pretty addicting considering the fact that it's not heavily sweetened. They also offer macarons to go with your drink. Macarons is soft and very delicious. I bought a dozen home with me and on day 3 it still taste as if I had bought it the day of.    Over all this is a pretty chill place. I'd come here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a frequent patron of the Kung Fu Tea in Virginia. Got the ordering down like a pro  and I know exactly what most of the drinks taste like and which ones I prefer. I usually order KF milk green tea  passion fruit green tea  passion fruit slush  matcha red bean slush  yogurt grapefruit  yogurt green tea  winter melon milk green tea  Oreo milk tea  taro slush  or matcha milk strike. If I can  I'll adjust sweetness levels to at least 50% and lower.   On a road trip up to New York  we stopped in Philly for lunch and afterwards decided to grab some Kung Fu Tea for the road. I ordered my usual matcha milk strike without anything else and didn't make any adjustments. Unfortunately  the matcha milk strike was not as good as the one I had in Virginia. They put too much powder and it was extremely bitter  even after I mixed and mixed. I could barely drink it. In the end  I had to dump most of it away.  My experience at Tea Do last time I was in Philly was much better. I still remain loyal to the Kung Fu Tea name  but I would be cautious with my drinks at this location.\n",
      "More expensive than other places  but it's worth getting a bubble tea with Lactaid and not feeling miserable for the rest of the day! Lots of different flavors and add ons.\n",
      "Bubble tea here was pretty good! Super refreshing and came out quickly. I got the Thai Milk tea with tapioca bubbles  however my only complaint is how inconsistent they are with taking card. I went two days in a row and one time they took card but the next day they didn't after I saw someone ahead of me in line paying with card.. that could be inconvenient for some pretty loyal customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Girlfriend and I grab lunch here often. They just redid the dining area to add a stylish bar. Yummy sandwiches  yummy soups  good coffee. Friendly staff. Would recommend.   I personally am a big fan of the pulled pork sandwich.\n",
      "\n",
      "this place is the best     really amazing great textured soups and great sandwiches   today i had the celery root soup   the african peanut soup   and we had a crabcake sandwich and a meatloaf sandwich    we shared everything   ..all made with fresh fresh fresh ingredients   really good stuff      ...great clean cute eating area   and a friendly hipster-ish  staff !!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I was looking forward to trying this place for a long time and I was kind of disappointed. I got the BBLT  and there were only 2 pieces of bacon! I was thinking there would be a significant piece of burrata also  but it's really just like a spread on one side of the bread. It's okay but not amazing as I'd hoped. I did also try the tomato basil soup which is quite tasty. I would try it again for something else because you can tell they use quality ingredients  I just wish it was a little more robust in this case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hosted a private party at the Soup Kitchen for my boyfriend's 30th birthday  it was perfect. Ben worked with me to create a menu that worked out wonderfully. Since it is a BYO we were able to bring in our own beers and wine which helped to keep the cost down. A great location for a party!\n",
      "The food is good  the location is wonderful. My only issues is most of the servers are aloof. A few of them are simply rude. I keep going back because of the food.   I have to say the last time we went the server was so sweet. I forgot her name but I wish the others would learn from her. We gave her a good tip. So aloof services gets you a 1$ dollar tip great service will get you plus 20%.  Get the meatloaf it is supper  After reading many of the post I think the verdict is in. The services is not the greatest -\n",
      "Delicious tomato basil!!!!!!! Shakshuka is yum and hearty as well. White bean chili was scrumptious and so was meatloaf sandwich.  Definitely coming back for more.\n",

      "This is a great vegan place to come and dine. When I walked in I thought the place was especially clean and welcoming. Everything I've tried from this place I thought was delightful. I have had the chicken burger  ziggy burger  their smoothie and the sweet potato fries. If all vegetarian food tasted this good  I would seriously consider becoming one.\n",
      "I would have given 5 stars in the past (and probably would give 5 stars to the chestnut location)  but recently I feel there's been a decline in quality.  I went in recently and their signature crispy ranch was soggy with no crunch.  Their fries were great  well seasoned.  Yet I felt the entire meal wasn't worth the 14.50.    I did have to walk 3 blocks  which may have caused some of the issue with the sandwich.  The fries and good customer service save this from being 3 stars in my mind  but the price prevents it from a 5 star.  Avoid peak hours.\n",
      "Ok so I lied. There is no falafel here. Went back and got the ziggy burger (eh)  crispy chick'n sandwhich (amazing!)  quinoa chili (yum)  udon salad (eh)  and sweet potato fries (pretty good). It's nice to have the option of a vegetarian fast food place because who knows what some of those places put in the mean.\n",
      "Ok so this was my first vegan meal and it did not disappoint. I ordered the chipotle \\chicken\\\" wrap with cabbage and sweet potato fries with siraracha aioli which was delicious!   The location itself is a quaint spot located in university city and the staff was very pleasant.  They had delicious looking desserts which I did not partake in but I look forward to to trying some my next time back.\"\n",
      "\\Just because it's vegan  doesn't mean it's healthy\\\" reported a friend of a friend  and I think he's totally right--in a good way.  On one of the first chilly days of Fall  I was not in the mood to gnaw on a fibrous salad for lunch. I wanted something warm and indulgent--and just vegan and eco-friendly enough for me to bask in a little first-world smug.  So  I got the crispy chick'n sandwich and sweet potato fries  both of these items really just hit the spot.  If you're looking for a healthier meal there are other items to choose from  and honestly  other places to go in the city. However  if you're looking to fill a Chik-fil-a sandwich sized hole in your soul--this may be for you.  Some notes: Sandwich is very good--bun may be a little much and they may be a tad generous with their ranch dressing  but these things are easily amended.  Fries--great--and this was after having to walk it back to my office a half mile away (yes  in the cold). What makes it better are the sauces: siracha aoli (YUM!) and black bean cilantro (yum).  Overall service was really personable and decor was lovely. Yes  it is a little pricey  but most vegan options tend to be..and yes  it relies heavily on faux meats  but keep in mind that sandwich sized hole in your soul.\"\n",
      "This was the best vegan food I've ever had! I ordered a $10 Crispy HipCity Ranch Chicken Sandwich  and it tasted like a classic chicken sandwich  but perhaps even better? The flavors were so good  and I quickly devoured the juicy sandwich. This location also had really friendly service.  I've tried their $4 Banana Whip at a HipCityVeg food truck  it was pretty good and is essentially healthy banana ice cream!  I'm very tempted to go back again tomorrow  and I'd go vegan for a day a week if it meant I could eat here! :)\n",
      "I really enjoyed the sweet potato fries with sriracha aioli - definitely the highlight of my visit.  Hip City Veg offers this sophisticated dish  which you might expect to see only at much fancier restaurants  in a casual  fast-food setting.  Based on prior Yelp reviews  I tried the udon noodle salad  which was pretty good  but was a little unbalanced and could be improved.  Although it had a promising start with a pleasant mix of \\chick'n\\\"  arugula  and alfalfa sprouts  the bottom half of the salad had too much seasoning.  An easy fix might be to ease up on the dressing  or leave it as a side component.    The dining atmosphere is pleasant - sort of like an eco-friendly  fast food joint that seeks to bring vegan dishes to the masses. I like the concept  but if you're a diehard carnivore  I'm not sure this place will convince you otherwise.  That said  the location is great if you are on the Penn campus looking for a lunch option or staying at the Homewood Suites on 41st and Walnut  and want to try something new. This location does a brisk take-out business  but it's also a casual place to dine alone or with a friend.  However  the space is not ideal for large groups except for the giant table in the middle of the room.  I look forward to seeing Hip City Veg in the Washington DC area.  It should do well there.\"\n",
      "Obsessed.  This is my go to delivery lunch place in the city.  Super healthy  super good! If you aren't vegan Vegetarian- this is still an awesome quick place to eat!\n",
      "Good happy hour! Their pizza was really good and so were their meatballs! Great ambience especially in good weather. Their bacon wrapped dates were really good  loved the blue cheese inside!\n",
      "First time visiting. Had an early dinner and the food was excellent!  Highly recommend the spaghetti squash  gnocchi  and the tiramisu for dessert. Everything was very fresh and seasoned well. Next time I'll have to try the pizza  it looks great.\n",
      "Good vibe and tasty food! We had a party of 6 visit for dinner and had a good experience.  The interior is arranged to create dining \\areas\\\" throughout the restaurant  which gives off a more intimate feel and the semi open kitchen adds to the overall atmosphere.  During our visit we sampled 4 different pizzas  calamari  the gnocchi  and steak skewer. The pizzas were delicious! Perfectly fired with a light crust. We sampled the Polpettini (meatball)  Short Rib (caramelized onions  short rib  and alfredo)  Rosa (garlic slices on top)  and the Magrherita.  All had the right amount of toppings and were not overloaded.  The gnocchi were enjoyed and had the right amount of sauce and cheese on top. The steak skewers were cooked perfectly with the right amount of char on them.  I was very pleased with the calamari  the lightness of the breading balanced well with the butteriness of the calamari.  Overall  we were very pleased with our visit and would return to try some of their other small plates.\"\n",
      "Pizza and salads are very nice. It's a little pricey  but the ambience is worth it.\n",
      "It's good but not amazing. I appreciate artisan pizza but the dough was dry and tough  there were way too many leaves on it  they were falling all over the place. They were out of their berries dessert which is the only one that appealed to me. Stella's is much better.\n",
      "We were walking by Zavinos the other day and liked the looks of the place so dropped in for a quick  light lunch. We both ordered their chopped salad and neither of us were all that impressed. For $11 it is small  not very many vegetables and doesn't come with crackers  pita bread..nothing! Giving the place 4 stars because the service was good  and other items on the menu and being consumed around us looked great. Especially the pizzas! We will dine here again.\n",
      "Mediocre food. It was also the waiter's first (and apparently last) day  so the service was not that great either. No real complaints though  since the price is about what you'd expect for the quality.\n",
      "Un excellent restaurant où déguster des pizzas italiennes et créatives  et déguster de bons vins au bar  ou attablés. La décoration du restaurant est créative  un cadre industriel qui s'accorde avec le Philadelphie qui est urbanisé. Nous n'avons pas goûté les vins car nous devions prendre la route par la suite  mais la carte des vins est plutôt intéressante. Mélange de vins américains et de vins du monde. Les pizzas étaient tout simplement sublimes. Rien à dire là-dessus. Un vrai régal ! Le service est discret et efficace à la fois.  Un bon restaurant à essayer  pour bien manger  dans un décor agréable !\n",
      "Zavino is a newer restaurant in University City and is located on Drexel University's campus.  I noticed the restaurant one day while traversing campus and decided to dine here with my girlfriend for lunch shortly afterwards.  The restaurant has outdoor seating as well as indoor seating and a bar.  The restaurant has a very nice layout and feels like a more modern Italian restaurant.  I really enjoyed the environment in this restaurant as it attempted to make the customers feel at home with the decorations and pictures.  The waitress we received was very friendly and nice which added a plus to our dining experience.    My girlfriend and I decided to share a variety food options here to try a handful of different items on the menu.  In the small plates section  we ordered the veal and ricotta meatballs.  These meatballs were very good and provided a nice flavor.  Secondly  we had a meat and cheese plate consisting of a specialty meat called \\Baby Jesus\\\"  which I found a bit odd  and a cheese called Scharfe Maxx.  Both the meat and cheese were very good and went well with the bread and seasonings offered with the dish.  The only thing I didn't understand was the name of the meat but I don't want to get involved with a religious debate over cured meat names.    Next  we decided to order their pasta special at the time which was squid ink pappardelle pasta and it was very good.  I personally enjoy trying different types of food  so when I had the opportunity to share squid ink pasta with my girlfriend  I had to accept.  Lastly  we decided to go out on the limb and order The Hacina  which is a spicy rock shrimp pizza.  The pizza came to the table basically layered in salad which was an interesting display for a pizza.  The pizza was good but it was very spicy  literally being one of the spicier food items that I have eaten in recent years.  My only complaint is that we ordered everything at once  so it ended up being piled up on our small table which made maneuverability and space an issue.  Either way  dealing with the overcrowding of food wasn't an issue as everything was pretty good.  Overall  I had a nice experience at Zavino and I would recommend it to anybody interested in having a casual  modern dining experience.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Went here for lunch today with coworkers- the pizzas were great! Big enough to share a smaller size with two people (if you are not that hungry)  but definitely not impossible to finish one on your own. We tried the Eggplant and the 4 cheese pizzas  and I would highly recommend the eggplant pizza  but I would pass on ordering the 4 cheese again  I found it quite bland. All in all would come back to try a few more pizzas  ( I have heard good things about the sausage!) or to repeat my eggplant experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5 out of 5 for the pizza  but 1 out of 5 for the service. My boyfriend and I came here early on a Friday night and ordered a margherita pizza to go. We waited for a solid 30-45 minutes before we decided to ask the hostess (who had been passing by us every few minutes or so) if our pizza would be ready soon. She responded by asking \\what was your name again?\\\" in a rather rude tone  then proceeded to grab a pizza box that was buried under quite a few other boxes behind the bar (i.e. it was sitting there for a while). She handed us our pizza and didn't even apologize!  Horrible service aside  the pizza was pretty amazing. The crust is thin like real Italian pizza and not overloaded with cheese. The sauce was excellent although I couldn't really taste the balsamic as advertised on the menu  but the flavorful basil laves made up for it. The restaurant itself is cute inside and tucked away on a side street. They offer outdoor seating  although very limited. Perhaps we'll go back and try dining in  but we probably won't be ordering a pizza to go again anytime soon.\"\n",
      "It was around 9pm and we had been walking around Philadelphia looking for a place to eat.  Nothing was hitting us and every time we got excited about a place  we discovered they were closed.  We gave up and went to pick up our car from Patriot Parking on Chancellor street.  The person who I was with said \\Let's just grab a slice of pizza over there.\\\"  Pointing to Pizzeria Vetri.  Neither of us really wanted pizza but we both half-heartedly agreed and walked across the street.  A.  It was one of the few places that we went to over our 3 day stay that had air conditioning.  So  it was pretty much the only time we were comfortable during our stay (even the hotel had awful air conditioning!).  B.  The place was clean and cute.  C.  The service was excellent and REALLY nice.  D.  The pizza was out of this world.  It was blackened on the bottom just as it should be.  DELICIOUS!!  We ordered 3 different pies and there was NOTHING left when we were done.  E.  We wanted to go back the next night to try the Nutella pizza but we weren't able to get back there.  I was really impressed and wish I could find a pizza place this good on Long Island.\"\n",
      "(to the sweet tune of Sia's \\Elastic Heart\\\")  And another patron bites the crust Oh why can I not take his 'za? And I know that I'm still waiting for ours.... Can't face this calzone without weapons.  Sure  they're just a fork and just a knife And I wish that one was sharper  yeah. But another patron bites the crust Yeah  let's be clear  I'm going in....  You can't beat this dough.... I'll eat just one more piece.....  'cuz it's got crisp crust and the perfect cheese Though sometimes it may flop in the breeze Toppings can weight it down  this pizza's so thin So eat it fast and you will win Get yourself a rotolooooo And bask in the glory of their dough.  Bask in the glory of their dough.... Just bask in the glory of their dough.  OK  now that THAT'S out of the way: last night was my first jaunt to Pizzeria Vetri's alley location. Nestled carefully on Chancellor street  semi-stealthy that you sort of have to hunt it down  we traipsed in ready to try one of everything. Except  their were three of us. So we decided to try one of three things.   1. Pizza al Taglio: Large  rectangular slice of the day (meat and non-meat options available). 2. Salsiccia - fennel sausage  roasted fennel  tomato sauce  and mozzarella pizza 3. Calzone - Ricotta  prosciutto cotto  tomato sauce  The pizza al taglio that we got.... it was male. Which  in Italian  just means bad. It was admittedly later in the evening  maybe around 8-9... but this slice was dry and structurally unsound. The toppings that were advertised were present  but in lower quantities than expected AND they fell off so easily that it turned into a fork and knife job. Disappointing.  The salsiccia was not a new dish to any of us  but the pronounced fennel made it an absolute joy to devour. The crust was perfectly crispy  the sausage savory without overpowering the dish  and the fennel light and fresh. My personal favorite.  The real Cinderella story  for me  was the Calzone. Only  in this Cinderella story  she never quite makes it to the ball. She just looks fantastic getting there  and everyone still ends up pretty happy. See  the prosciutto and ricotta was tasty.... it just wasn't in every bite. Unfortunate  but the innards of a calzone are enigmatic and I can't imagine there's any way to fully control. The dish didn't come with enough sauce  though we requested more  it never made it our way. Oh well.  Otherwise  the service was impeccable. Our server  Sydney  was funny  friendly  and went with the flow (such as one of the dining party requesting \\\"the first beer listed.\\\" and not caring what it was). She even went out of her way to hunt down the name of an artichoke liqueur we were discussing (Cynar  thanks Syd). The pizza  as per  was delish. The portions of the calzone full of meat and cheese were great. The taglio.... left much to be desired.  I love the options of sparkling water  the prices aren't cheap but aren't outrageous  and the communal tables was a fun setting. We also really dug the music all night.  We'll be back  but we'll probably stick to the classics.\"\n",
      "The vibe inside Pizzeria Vetri is nice and casual which I love. Next time I visit I would love to meet up with friends for dinner and sit at the counter.  This time  however  I can only speak to the take out.  I got take out from Pizzeria Vetri for two pizzas  - the Margherita and the Renato.  The Margherita is a classic and you can't go wrong - basil  mozzarella  and tomato Sauce.  The Renato had mozzarella  rosemary  olive oil  and sea salt.  Out of the two pizzas the Margherita was my favorite. It was so simple yet tasty and fresh.  The service was quick and friendly.  I would have to say that the location is a little odd to me.  It's behind walnut street sort of in the alley.  People that aren't locals to the area might have trouble finding it. The only reason I noticed it in the first place is that because a good friend lives in the building in front on walnut street.  Also  the pizzas are a little on the pricey side  however  I would consider them gourmet.\n",
      "Great beer selection! Casual atmosphere and picnic table bench style seating. We went very early for dinner so didn't have to wait for a spot at all. Not sure what the normal wait time is.   This place can be no frills..they only have ice cream for dessert  I am vegetarian and the only non meat pizzas I could order was the margherita pizza. Luckily  it was fantastic! I think they have slices as an option but I was starving and got a small pizza that I shared with my boyfriend. He ordered a salad and tried to add chicken to which the waitress replied that they don't have chicken here. Note  I still give this place 4 stars. I think you just have to know what you are getting into. The food is quality though so we will definitely be back.   The pizza is baked in a wood oven so the crust had that crispy taste and smell which I love.\n",
      "I've only been here once but it was a great experience.  Especially because I got to meet Marc Vetri!!   My friends and I sat at the counter around the pizza ovens.  Great seats and great service.  We were able to see the kitchen in action.  The pizza was VERY good but not sure it's the best I've ever had.  I love it's location.  Not your typical location and close to my home. I do wish they had a full bar tho!\n",
      "This place opens till 1am on Friday and Saturday! Great for some late night bites and even after a drink or two early night. It wasn't busy at all when I came on a Saturday night which i was quite surprised. Hope they keep the hours extended.   Tucked away in Rittenhouse area and across from a parking garage. There are two large tables outdoors but the view isn't so great because of the car park. But the place has a good enough reputation to be in a not so ideal location (like Elixr).  Tried the special slice of the day  the Figs which comes in Sicilian style--thick crusted. Also tried the rotolo which i'm not sure if it's a true italian food or a Vetri creation. It was very nice with generous crushed pistacchio. Can't wait to come back again.\n",
      "Good beer  decent food  nice interior. I had the burger  it wasn't mind-blowing but I enjoyed it. Kev had the catfish poboy  he thought it could use a bit more of a kick  the flavor was a tad lacking.  Service was quick  efficient  and friendly. I'd go back and try the chicken and waffles.\n",
      "Cedar Point is pretty legit. My girlfriend and I have been twice and thought our food was great. We've had the vegetarian chili  the pulled pork sandwich  and the white bean kale burger. It was super tasty and filling. The beer selection is alright  but overall the service is great and the atmosphere is cool.\n",
      "My friends and I stopped in here while we were waiting for a ridiculously long wait for Loco Pez on dollar taco night. The bartenders were super friendly and did a great job of keeping up with everyone sitting at the bar. They had a great draft list  having a ton of variety on types of beers for a good price. They have a late night happy hour as well  starting at 10!\n",
      "I enjoyed dinner here so much I've been twice in one week.   Pros: Extensive veggie and vegan options... that actually taste good. The veggie wings are the best I have ever had (they also come with brussel sprouts  making it more like a meal). My spouse enjoyed the meat cheese steak and chicken wings. You can sit inside or out  both of which are comfortable and spacious. Happy hour options are spot on with app and drink specials. Service has been friendly and quick.  Cons: None really. I was bummed when I showed up during the transition hour when the kitchen was closed (not posted on google). Also  the second time I got the veggie wings they were not warm and the brussel sprouts were not full pieces (instead the crunchy single pieces). Still good though. They probably would have remedied this if I requested.\n",
      "I want to love this place but I'm stuck in the middle. I've gone to Cedar Point 3 times (once for just drinks) and ordered different items each time. I love the atmosphere and The fact that there's a few vegan options on the menu. The first time I went  I ordered the Green Hash and subbed plantain cakes for eggs and got veggie sausage. I didn't know what to expect with the plantain cakes  but they were basically like dry banana pancakes. I wish I would have known that's what they were because I would have just asked for a side of potatoes.  The hash and plantain cakes just didn't seem like a good combo to me. We also tried the veggie wings with buffalo sauce. If you're vegan  specify without the butter in the sauce. They were just okay. I wasnt impressed after some hype about them on other reviews I've read. Service was friendly though and prompt despite being busy for a Sunday afternoon brunch time.    The second time we went with a group of 4 and sat at the bar. I ordered the kale burger and stressed the \\vegan way\\\". A few items can be made vegan or vegetarian if specified. I also ordered a side of potatoes. Food took a while  but that was fine because we were all about the drinks.  Once my food came  the server noticed a tattoo of mine which says vegan on my arm and said \\\"Oh  let me take this sauce away that comes with the potatoes  it's not vegan.\\\" I didn't care much about that. But then when we realized the kale burger was mine   he told me that they put my burger on the wrong type of bun and that I had to wait for a new one becaise there's butter all over the roll. I was honestly too hungover to really care that much  but I did get annoyed once the server then said to me that I must habe not specified \\\"vegan\\\" when ordering with the bartender  which I did. Waited a few minutes for the bun while the rest of my group ate. The bartender was apologetic once he noticed the mix up. Kale burger was a little bland but it did come with this awsome vegan aioli. I feel like maybe it would be better if all vegan items were just seperate and their own item rather than a vegan/non vegan option. It would just be easier for people ordering and for The waiters.   The rest of my group enjoyed their food. Bartender was pretty stressed out  which he made it known   but his drinks were great.   I feel like I might just stick to drinks next time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been here on multiple occasions and have always left somewhat disappointed. The place has an odd smell in the back  and the food is mediocre. The only thing going for this place is that it's cute. Waffles? Soggy. Fries? Soggy. Burger? Underwhelming. They mix bbq sauce with syrup and call it a special syrup on their waffles.... But it's just gross.\n",
      "Great place if you are looking for happy hour specials! I came here on a Thursday night and they had some really good deals. As a table  we ordered fried pickles  ranch pretzel knots  and buffalo wings. Everything was so good. The fried pickles came with a honey mustard and aioli sauce for dipping. The ranch garlic knots were life-changing  seriously  I could have eaten all four. They were seasoned perfectly and the ranch sauce was a nice touch. The buffalo wings were also very delicious. I feel like you can never go wrong with wings  but they came with baby brussel sprouts on time and I thought that was a great topping choice. Needless to say  everything was devoured in minutes.   My drink choice that night was something they had on special. I ordered the watermelon mojito and it was really tasty. The only thing I would add is that I wish it had a little more of the watermelon flavor to it. Otherwise  I thought it was the perfect summer drink. Between the six of us  our bill was about $15 each. I didn't think that was bad for all the food and drinks we ordered.\n",
      "I love this place. It's in a cute little area in fishtown and the atmosphere of the bar restaurant is great. The food is amazing as well. it has vegetarian vegan options. My favorite thing to get is the ceasar salad with buffalo tossed cauliflower fritters. I hate cauliflower yet this salad is one of my favorites  and it is very filling. My boyfriend got the fried chicken and waffles and said it was really good. He loved the BBQ syrup they put on the corn muffin waffle. Would definitely recommend if you're in the area or are looking for a tasty meal!\n",
      "Horrible experience. I usually avoid leaving bad reviews even for some bad restaurants or bars  but wow  this was awful. Couldn't tell you anything about the food because after being told 15 minutes for a wait  and then 15 minutes  and the. 15 minutes... I absolutely understand how hard it is to estimate a wait. However  there were so many open tables that after an HOUR of waiting I decided to move the 2 tables it would take to seat us together. Bad mistake as I was yelled at for finally taking it upon myself to get seated. In short this was the absolute worst experience I have had.\n",
      "My friend and I came here around 2pm on a Monday. It happened by default  as most of the restaurants on Main Street were closed. We sat ourselves down at the bar and got to drinking. After a few drinks  I ordered the pulled pork tacos and my friend had a burrito. Not bad  not stellar. Just a standard very place to drink and eat Mexican food. It's got a very college feel even in the middle of the day  so keep that in mind if that's not your thing.\n",
      "Full disclosure: I have no experience with their food (other than the free chips which  meh). The special place Cactus holds in my heart is for one thing: Margarita Mondays.  I walked in to Cactus this Monday with a friend from work  and the bartender had a pitcher of 'ritas going before we even sat down. Point to Cactus: The staff is on top of stuff for their regular customers.  The service can be a little slow at times  but once we get a table full of margarita pitchers life is beautiful. The 'ritas themselves aren't the most consistent (this week's were a little heavy on the juice) but for $10 I'm not complaining. And  to reply to one of the posts  they definitely don't skimp on the tequila. In fact  the bartender measures out the liquor for ever pitcher. Margaritas are pretty sweet so you can't taste it too much  and I'm sure it isn't quite as much as you'd get in a non-special  but believe me it's there.  My most serious gripe  actually  is the music. Don't know who puts the mixes on  but I protest. They actually played 'Closing Time' the other night - at 10:00  when people were still coming in. Way to send the wrong message.  It's not the best place around by any stretch  but if you ever need to unwind after a long Monday  you'll find me at Cactus.\n",
      "I got Cactus delivered. The salsa tastes like there's BBQ sauce in it  which to me is gross. The queso fundido was paste like and was hard to reheat. The chorizo reminded me of a regular pork breakfast sausage.  Portions were generous being delivery. I should have checked reviews first ...\n",
      "\n",
      "I Came here a few times for drinks and food. This place plays music at night so that's a plus for me. I was very impressed by their salsa  I'm pretty picky about my salsa  comes in right spicy level where you have to keep eating otherwise your tongue will burn.   Their outside seating is very enjoyable during the summer/fall/spring seasons.\n",
      "Absolutely terrible in every aspect.  My fiancé and I came here on a Saturday at 5:45.  All of the waitstaff were standing around the back of the restaurant looking at us awkwardly.  Eventually the bartender greeted us from behind the bar and pointed to the table where we will be seated.  I ordered \\The Cactus\\\" margarita  and it was salt lime juice and water.  Not a drop of tequila in it.  I'll give it to them that the salsa was good because of the added chipotle.  However  they have the audacity to charge $4 for an extra basket of stale chips.  Our food came out reasonably quick. My fiancé ordered the chicken fajitas and I ordered the 5-Alarm burrito.  Mine was dry as a bone  bland  and not spicey at all.  I'm reasonably sure that they got a frozen burrito from wava and heated it under a panini press.  My fiancée chicken was also dry and just over all bland.  Then came the waiting. We asked our waitress for the check and then she disappeared for 20 minutes.  I asked her again as she passed by our table  and still had to wait another 10 minutes.  It's a different story if they were the only show in town  but this is Main Street manayunk.  There is no reason for places like this to be taking up space if this is the quality and service they are offering.\"\n",
      "We came from center city because the corn cheese mix they do with their nachos really goes unmatched. For the rest of the menu: fish tacos burnt to a visible crisp. Pitcher of margs more watery than margy. We left and went for drinks elsewhere. Wait staff was extremely available tho. 3 stars because of waitstaff. Won't travel back for food again.\n",
      "I don't often find myself in manayunk  but I was there for a friend's birthday. That being said I'm not too familiar with the rest of the Main Street scene. Cactus was... below average. The bar was set pretty low  but my expectations still weren't met unfortunately. The restaurant itself is very difficult when it comes to customizing orders (for example they have shredded chicken for burritos but can't put the shredded chicken in a quesadilla). I don't think they realize it's literally the same thing just in a different form.   The wait staff was over bearing in my opinion. Our waitress kept butting into Over conversation when she came by with remarks like \\did I just hear you say you don't like corn?\\\" Im all about being friendly but \\\"was I talking to you?\\\" Made us help her clean the table bc she had another party coming in very soon. All in all the vibe was weird probably won't be returning anytime soon\"\n",
      "This was probably the worst service I've ever received. I came in tonight for a drink with friends. Our server was Elizabeth. She did not greet me as I came to the table  and she did not take my drink order  a different server who I caught just in time took my order. After I asked for another round  she actually told us she was \\heading out\\\" and made us close our tab. Very poor service and attitude. I will probably not be coming back.\"\n",

      "If you're looking for a good variety of pizza  this is the place to go. If you're looking for new and different kinds of pizza (Reuben pizza - for example)  this is the place to go. If you're looking for delicious pizza  this is the place to go. So what are you waiting for?!\n",
      "Nothing special. Save your money.   We ordered the plain red whole pie and were very disappointed.  Tastes like a $5 rusty pie.  Dough was tough to chew  sauce and cheese were flavorless  VERY salty/sour.\n",
      "Yummy  yummy and MORE YUMMY!!! They have interesting unique flavored pizza's and tasty crust. I always like whatever ive tried.\n",
      "Holy Hangover Heaven.  Don't you hate when you had a bit too much to drink the night before? You know  those days when you just can't seem to separate your ass from the couch?  If you are having one of those days  I have some grand advice. Get yourself a pizza  any pizza from Rustica. Today  I was hurtin'  hurtin' kinda bad y'all. All I wanted was a vitamin water  and something hearty to eat.   Red pie with pepperoni and garlic  Om nom nom. It was quite fast delivery  and it was only 20 bucks for a large  hangover dismissing  pizza. I  well  I think I love you a little bit Rustica.\n",
      "Their pizza is fantastic  what they specialize in. But there are a few things elsewhere on the menu that keep bringing us back. The buffalo chicken cheesesteak is made with big  all white chunks of real chicken breast  not slabbed steak-meat. And the fries are shoestring!   Went in for takeout a few times - each time the cooks/servers get together the delivery orders and waited to start our steaks while we sat their. They must've done 6-7 steaks that day in bags till the delivery person came back while we waited 45 for two sandwiches and two orders of fries. Just get delivery.\n",
      "\n",
      "You wont find a better place in Northern Liberties! The staff is awesome  the food is really good. My favorite things are a plain slice ( to me you can tell a lot about a places pies with a plain slice) and the chicken cheesesteak!  There has to be AT LEAST 2 full chicken breasts on the thing  yea breasts not frozen chicken steaks. The rolls are nice hard rolls with sesame seeds. I can't say enough about the place. I live an hour and a half outside Philly but I am always in town for work. Rustica is a great choice when having a pizza craving.\n",

      "5 Stars all day everyday.  Philadelphia magazine got it right  definitely the best pizza in Philly.  Prices are reasonable as well.\n",
      "Love this place! I've been here a few times  most recently for Valentine's Day. Their prix fixe menu was great and we got a bottle of champagne with our dinner. The atmosphere is awesome  it's just a cool place to stop by for dinner or drinks.\n",
      "It is what it looks like. Neighborhood local. Not a sophisticated rest. but a great place for comfort food. Took my brood of kids there for lunch. Service was warm and attentive. Food yummy. Desserts humungous and fresh. Pretty  interesting interior. Definitely going back!\n",
      "All of the food we got was super tasty. The service was a little slow and there were some small mix-ups. But the food - fried chicken sandwich  fries  (accidental) home fries  pork roll breakfast sandwich  side salad - was really good and the mimosas weren't bad either  )\n",

      "I had the best cheeseburger there on Memorial Day!  Fresh  juicy  huge  and delicious!  There are a number of good burger spots in Philly  and Foys is right there with the best!\n",
      "Visited here on a Friday early evening. There weren't any large crowds  no wait time  and pretty fast service. Also I had a great burger  not the best in Philly  but tasty on a soft greased bun. I ordered Sangria  which gave me a little extra boost of laughter  lol. Overall  I had a pretty good experience. Getting to the bathroom was somewhat of maze  but this is a good spot to people watch and catch a breeze.\n",
      "\n",
      "I truly love the atmosphere here  the service has always been good and the food great. Seems like an obvious trinity but so many restaurants fall short of all three. Bridget Foys does not. Good job and thank you!\n",
      "Used to stop in here quite a bit back in the day. Please note  because of my work I see a lot places from the best in class to festivals.  Service sucked- bartender was too busy chatting it up with employees Food- Philly is great for wings  these were not good. Atmosphere - charming  Perhaps it was an off night?\n",

      "My office held our Christmas party here  and I have to say I was really anticipating the worst.  I read some of the reviews and judging by the lady who picked the location for the party  I just had really low expectations.  I am so relieved that I was wrong.  We ordered off of the catering menu  which I'm not sure is available for regular walk- in diners  but man oh man.  Everything was really good.  The meatloaf was the best I have ever had. Ever.  And I just don't see meatloaf as one of those foods to get excited about- but I can't stop thinking about it!  The staff was very friendly  and the atmosphere in the back room with the fireplace was super cozy and sweet.\n",

      "Nice  little coffee shop. Space is a little tight in the front  but there's additional seating in the back with a full dining menu. I enjoyed a tasty maple  cinnamon latte & veggie omelette.\n",
      "I live just a few blocks from Gold Standard Cafe and I love having breakfast there. Now  I've only been there during warmer months so we can sit outdoors in a super cute area that is a nice distance from the street. You really get great food for a great price!  Inlets are really big and fluffy and ... Tasty!  We've never dined inside but we planned to when it's colder.\n",
      "The Gold Standard Cafe is a solid brunch experience  especially after a late night in a smoke filled club with drag queens.  I got the hash with chirizo and it hit the spot.  The chai was very yummy and my sister liked her quiche a lot.  We didn't have to wait for a table and service was very friendly.\n",
      "I came with a group and the service was prompt  the food was tasty  and the prices were super reasonable. I had the chicken caesar wrap with fries  which was tasty. According to others in my group  though  the grilled cheese was amazing and the best they've ever had. As for the ambience  Gold Standard feels like you're inside someone's house  and I'd definitely go back  either with a group or not.\n",
      "Loved how accommodating the place is.  They let us drink our Crisp White boxed wine on their patio while waiting for our table during Saturday brunch.  If you're going to BYOB  stick with the orange juice for either mimosas or screwdrivers. We got both the OJ and the bloody mary mix  and the BM was gross. No one finished their drink  not even after we doused it in hot sauce.   I got a burger  it was mediocre  I was much more interested in my mimosa and boxed white wine.  My friends seemed to enjoy their eggs benedict and waffle.  The ham on the benedict was good  SUPER salty and yummy.\n",
      "I've been to the Gold Standard twice: once for lunch and once for a late brunch. Both times were really different experiences.   I went there for lunch with just one other person in the summertime  but the wait time was about 20 minutes to get a table on a Sunday afternoon (which is a pretty long time for a West Philadelphia restaurant). We even agreed to do outdoor seating (it was about 90 degrees outside) and it still took forever. The service was also really really slow and at one point I got so sick of waiting that I just started going to the register myself to ask for things and brought them back to the table myself. However this may be because they don't have the staff to handle the capacity of this place.  The biggest plus to The Gold Standard is that they make all of their food and its really fresh. I ordered the Tofu Scramble which was good but was a bit plain for my taste. They also have a really diverse menu and a lot of veggie/vegan options. The food can also be made as healthy as you want it to be. The dessert always looks AMAZING (even though both times I was way too full from my meal to order any)  The second time I went here was with a small group for a late brunch. It till took about a half an hour to get seated  but the service at the table was much better. The amount of brunch options (plus the regular lunch menu) was almost overwhelming. I really loved the Southwest Chicken Wrap (they even let me order it sans wrap..so it was more southwest chicken salad). They also have really great coffee and bacon.  The prices are pretty decent... My entree  coffee and side order of bacon came to $15 with tip.   Overall I would recommend this place for when you have a lot of time and want a fresh meal...especially for vegetarians!\n",
      "This place is the definition of hit-or-miss. Snuggled in a lovely building on the 48th and Baltimore peninsula  The Gold Standard Cafe is awash in the tepid waters of mediocrity. I've had food here that has been god awful (like a watery tofu scramble) and I've had food that I've liked (like a black bean burger)  but most commonly my meals have been \\fine\\\". Not great  just fine. The coffee is sometimes okay  sometimes burnt  the waitstaff is sometimes friendly  sometimes incompetent and aloof. You never know what you're going to get!  Overall  I've had better luck with dinner here than breakfast/brunch.  I've never loved the food  but it's close to my house and inexpensive  so I frequently find myself here late Sunday morning because I'll be damned if I'm going to hike to Sabrina's or Honey's or Green Eggs only to wait 45 minutes for a table. The convenience keeps me coming back for more  but if you want a great brunch and are willing to spend a little  just go to Aksum. I'll say this though: the place has the potential to be something great. The location is perfect and the space is lovely. There is outdoor seating  perfect for a spring brunch. And I can bring my dog  which is nice. They just need to amp up their menu!\"\n",
      "Went here a second time a few days later for lunch with my girlfriend. Got the chicken Cesar Salad wrap  which would have been great -- except it had SO much dressing on it. I tend to like to go very light on the dressing  so I thought that I was just being picky  but when I got closer to the end of the wrap it wouldn't stop squirting out and it got all over my jeans.. so.. yeah. Then  our waiter never came back to check on us  so we had to go inside and ask about getting a bill  finally. So I'm still only A-OK with this place. I *want* to like you  Gold Standard  but you just keep giving me bronze-level service.\n",

      "Best cheesesteaks in my opinion  they specialize in sandwiches. Small place but great service and great food!!!\n",
      "Great sandwiches here. Fries are ok nothing spectacular.  Cheesesteak and coffee shortrib are really good. So is the turkey sandwich  except for the roll. The sandwich is almost perfection  but that multigrain roll is HORRENDOUS.  -1 star for carrying that roll.\n",
      "This place is killing it  everything is so damn good.  I've been working through their menu  and have yet to find anything that's not amazing.    I'm Cuban  and their Cuban sandwich is dead on point flavor wise.  The cheese steak is amazing with the truffle whiz.  The \\Not so\\\" breakfast sandwich is amazing.  Their fries are the best on South St  hands down.\"\n",
      "walked by this place and saw this new place so decided to give it a shot. got the pork with broccoli rabe sandwich and my girlfriend got the mahi sandwich. both were pretty good  and I noticed that my pork sandwich wasn't as greesy as the other places I've tried. The meat was delicious and the rabe was only slightly bitter. the fries are cut steak style like they have at five guys. overall a great place for lunch  and I will definitely return to try other things on the menu\n",
      "Huge lover of good food here. Will go out of my way to try the best of the best. I live a couple blocks from Woodrow's so when it opened I had to try it out. I've now tried at least 6 of the sandwiches and have not been disappointed at all. Come here over paesano's now. Big flavors  high quality. Well done\n",
      "I'm from NJ and finally got the chance to go to Philly and words can't describe how much I love this city. So my first time coming to Philly I tried the pats geno and wasn't impressed at all. But I wasn't gonna give up  I was determined to find that special cheese steak. Someone put me on John roast pork which WOW me but the only problem is there nothing to do around that area. So me and my buddy walked on south street and into Atomic City Comics. The staff were very knowledgeable in what spots had the best cheese steaks. Jim was an option but it there was a line and I'm not beat to wait on line but they said try next door to Woodrow sandwich  which is a hidden Gem. Going inside the staff were very friendly and loved the fact I was an outsider. They serve us steak sandwiches with there special cheese they MAKE! and the fries OMG were Amazing! Me and my buddy felt like Harold and Kumar at the end when they finally go to white castle and the enjoyment of eating a great meal.... I now found my spit and have gone there every time I go to Philly. I even put my friends on it and told em that if they don't like it \\I will refund there money\\\" of course I never had to do that. I can't wait til the weather gets nice so I can go back there\"\n",
      "Okay  that was one of the best short rib sandwiches I've had in a while.  Was it \\mind blowing\\\"?  Probably not- but it was DAMN good and I honestly could have made room for a second because I was still craving it after the fact.  The combination of caramelized onions  cheddar and a perfect  not-too-sour horseradish sauce all wrapped up neatly in a fresh roll made it so worth the $10.50.  The fresh cut fries were boardwalk style-a little too big and potato-ey for my liking and not that crunchy  but still salty enough.  I ordered through TryCaviar  and though the delivery came twenty minutes earlier than expected  we only received 1 order of fries as opposed to 2- could have been the restaurant  could have been the courier- not a big deal  though.  I will say the menu is unfortunately way too small  but I'll definitely order from here again to maybe try the meatball or get the short rib again.\"\n",
      "Easily the best cheesesteak in Philly. The bread was like eating a cloud and the \\wiz\\\" was deliciously flavored with truffles. I was licking my fingers after I finished it and found myself still wanting more. The fries are tasty but the real winning side dish was the mixed green salad-- a perfect  light  refreshing compliment to a very decadent sandwich. Excellent service and very reasonable prices too!\"\n",

      "It's hard to eat at Le Pain Quotidien without feeling like a bit of an ass. I've been to this one and to two locations in NYC (Upper East Side and Soho). The reason I say this is because the food  while tasty  is always served on teeny tiny plates  just urging you to make a mess of crumbs and debris from your open face \\sandwich.\\\" And the atmosphere is so unspeakably ostentatious - in its good taste - just reeking of privilege in a way that I find embarrassing. I like the freshly baked spelt bread  the tuna pesto \\\"sandwich\\\"  and the coffee  but I feel like such a douche-bag when I eat here. It's just the vibe.\"\n",
      "So listen. Le Pain Quotidien is the best of both worlds. There's a coffee shop at the front of the store  if you want hot drinks and pastries to go. It's also a restaurant  where you seat yourself and have a waiter for your table. Yes  the cups are more like bowls and  yes  sometimes the place is short-staffed  but the food will never let you down. Everything I've ordered here has been delicious and I will definitely come back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I rarely ever review anything  but I just had to give a shoutout to the excellent customer service I've received every time I've come here!   While Le Pain Quotidien is a little pricey to eat there on the daily  I came to this location two times in a row last week because the wonderful woman behind the counter was SO friendly and attentive and speedy! I got a cup of soup and some bread to-go for $7  which ain't bad for a small  but decent lunch. The first time  I waited no more than 7min or something. The second time  it took a little longer  like 10min  but again  that wonderful woman behind the counter gifted me with a complimentary mint lemonade! It's a small gesture  and not even necessary for such a short wait  but it made an impression on me. Such fabulous service!   The food is pretty good. I've never ventured far from the soups (that's all I can really afford!)  but they come with bread and I'm more or less satisfied. Simple  tasty  organic  and healthy.\n",
      "Sunday Brunch   Breakfast -  Crowded -  Tight tables - Lots of baby carriages  - Noisy - Food was just OK -  Do not mind spending $5.95 for Oatmeal but $2.95 for a cup of coffee - NOT.  4 coffee's 3 salads and some fruit salad   sides for 4 was $90 without tip.  Service was spotty  -  Asked for Splenda for the coffee and by time it got there coffee was no longer hot - Asked for lemon for the water and had to ask again.  The strangest part of the experience was when the table next to us handed us our check because the waiter could not get through the tight tables to give it to us directly.  Not sure if I would go running back anytime soon.\n",
      "The atmosphere was nice and the wait staff pleasant.  The decor evoked a rustic French experience.  The food and drink was served quickly.  I wanted to like it BUT  the food is just mediocre.    My Roast Beef tartine that I ordered was rather skimpy.  The meat was grey looking not pink or reddish.  Grey looking meat is just icky.  The bread was a bit on the limp side and a little soggy.  The seasoning was fine.  I hate to say that I have had better at Le Bon Pain.    The cappacino was served in one of the most oddest cups  one without a handle.  You are supposed to grip the base which made the delivery (for the server) a bit hazardous for all involved.  sure  it is a cute  clever design but I thought  \\Get over it and bring me a real coffee cup.\\\"   Their breads cannot touch Le Bus for flavor  texture and taste.  Since this was once a clothing store  I think. there was only one bathroom in the place which is a bit taxing when the place is rushed.  Also  considering it is a recession  the prices were a bit much considering the quality of the food.\"\n",
      "Bianca  I am unable to provide check number or server name as no one ever came to serve me and my family.\n",
      "I was pretty excited to see Le Pain Quotidien here in Philly - I loved it in NYC.  The breads and pastries are dependably great. The Philadelphia version seems to be pretty busy at all times - and the communal table is a great choice as it is really fast service.  The sandwiches are great here - and the ingredients are all pretty darn fresh and great. The soup is pretty super  and the service was relatively great. It is a bit pricey - but so are many Le Pain's. I look forward to going here at different times and figuring out when I can sit there and do work.\n",

      "Stopped by this cute little cafe after I found it on Yelp. I was near the area and needed a quick place to relax before an event. The space is long and narrow but ample seating and bright and airy. The overall aesthetic is very pleasing. The pastry case by the late afternoon wasn't super filled but there were enough options to choose from like the lemon tarte which was delicious! The coffee menu itself is rather small. I ordered a mocha which was definitely a more bitter chocolate which I didn't mind  but if you're used to sweet like Starbucks this may be a pass for you. The people working here were nice. The prices were a tad expensive for coffee and pastries especially when the coffee isn't super elaborate. I also wish they would use real cups. They might have these but they didn't bother to ask if my order was to go or not. They offer bread for purchase as well. The staff was nice  the bathrooms clean. Overall a pretty great cafe in Philly perfect for an afternoon pick me up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great staff and delicious pastries! This really is a professional bakery  with all sorts of French delicacies... you name it  they have it. The owner and staff are super friendly and helpful. Its a cool place to stop by any time of the day to meet up with friends  study  grab a quick snack or some good coffee. Try the quiche  highly recommended!\n",
      "Adorable  sunny little place with the best pastries! The almond eclairs were especially great  and paired perfectly with the deliciously thick and unsweetened hot chocolate.\n",
      "Yo the croissants here are banging. Probably the best in Philly. Great coffee and solid spot to get some work done. They also accept credit card  and it's such a clean and modern looking bakery. Everyone here is so friendly. A real gem right here.\n",
      "I'm from out of town and stumbled upon this lovely France bakery. What a treat! It is exactly what it states it is. French. And a bakery. I went two days in a row for a slice of their delicious orange olive oil cake and a pot of English Breakfast tea. I loved the brand of tea so much ( Kusmi from Paris) that I bought a box when I saw it in a nearby shop. The atmosphere is relaxing and a delightful respite from a busy day. Oh  and the employees are helpful and so nice. Most highly recommended.\n",
      "We went to this cute little bakery & cafe serving French pastries  sandwiches  crepes & coffee for breakfast. We got there quite early in the morning  there were few people who were getting things to go  instead of dining in  which gave us all the seating options. They had some tables right at the entrance  and then more seating in the back.  The cafe is located on the corner lot  so it had lots of windows on the front and the side  bringing in bright natural light.  Right at the entrance  they had some bread and baked goods  such as croissant  apple turnover  and raisin roll. On the side  they had lots of sweets such as macarons  tartlet  and éclairs. They also had some quiche as well. Since we were there super early  the pasty chef was still working on some items.  We started off with a couple of pastries and cups of coffee. I got a small Latte  and it was really small... They ground coffee beans at the time of order  which is great. The coffee was quite good  I wish if the mug was a bit bigger  even though I did order small. My hubby ordered a Cappuccino  they didn't have any choice of size  it came in a mug that is similar to the latte mug  but a bit shorter and wider. They were tasty coffees  again  just really small...  We had Sugared Chouquette  Napoleon  French Jam Crêpe and Paris Philadelphia. They were all very tasty  high quality and oh-so-satisfying. It was a fun and tasty visit. The service was ok  not overly friendly but efficient. Their sweets were elegant and sophisticated  we enjoyed them all.\n",
      "I have been looking for a good French Napoleon for a long time after Wegmans discontinued to bake Napoleon.  When I saw my FB showing a photo of Napoleon from J'aime  I can't wait to give it a try.   We went J'aime on Christmas Eve but they ran out of Napoleon so we ordered Chouquette which is very surprising good. The cream of Chouquette is very light without heavy sweet and last time I had such silky smooth cream with good/right puff is from beard papa(Japanese bakery).    So  I decided to come back today in order to get in line for Napoleon. Like Chouquette  Napoleon also has a very velvet moisture cream and because J'aime doesn't glazed sugar or fondant on the top layer  it won't too sweet which I can even eat a whole without coffee or tea. We also ordered Quiché and I like pie crust of Quiché at J'aime is thinner than Le Pain Quotidien.\n",
      "\n",
      "Execellent bakery. We had cold coffee  fruit tarte  napoleon  and rasin roll. All were fanatasitic!!  Kind employer is another plus+\n",
      "Given the good reviews  I wanted to like this place  but the food left much to be desired.    The food seemed to be generic Mediterranean foods rather than the Syrian/Armenian cuisine I was excited to sample.  We had an assortment of appetizers  but the dishes were bland (including a babaganoush that didn't seem have much eggplant at all).  There seemed to be a great dearth of garlic  salt  and pepper in the kitchen.    The pita chips were my biggest complaint and were not a good accompaniment to the dishes  given that the chef comes from regions well-known for their bread  I was expecting some really good lavash.  Moreover  the chips were under-toasted!  I had many chips that were half-crunchy  half-limp.  It made for an unpleasant texture.  They tasted like store-bought pitas toasted without olive oil or seasoning.   I don't think I'll be back  at least for some time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tried this place for the first time and the only thing I was disappointed about was that I had not tried it sooner. This is the ultimate authentic  family owned   cozy  byob  fresh Mediterranean/Armenian spot probably in all of Philly.   The owner took care of us and helped us decide what to order  even convincing me to try the lamb which I never eat. I ordered the combo platter with chicken  lamb  and the beef stick (forget the term). All the meat was cooked so incredibly well  so juicy  so flavourful. Also ordered the Greek salad and babaganoush  which did not disappoint at all. Also got a side of the grape leaves (sooo good!) and the cheese puff (also forget the name lol).   There are so many other dishes I want to try here. I'll definitely be back soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great food and awesome service!   I love Mediterranean food and this place did not disappoint. Everything was good  and the service was excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm Armenian and this place makes me homesick.  The prices and portions are super reasonable  so it's very easy to try a bunch of the Armenian appetizers. This is the only place in Philly I've found lahmajoon (Armenian pizza)  and you can never go wrong with boregs and dolma. The kabobs are among the best in the city! The service is really quick and super friendly.\n",
      "Cute place.. Great staff the food was really good. I like the choices of dips. The desserts was absolutely amazing I'm craving one now. The menu had good selections and the prices are good  also it's a Byob place always a plus. I will definitely come back!\n",
      "\n",
      "Cute menus  nice atmosphere  great loaction.    The Chicken Tom Gah soup didn't impress the pants off me  couldn't taste the galangal or lemongrass at all.    I split a Yum Woodsen salad with a friend  but instead of shrimp we asked for beef instead  and it was fabulous.  Fresh veggies  delicious beef  and excellent dressing.    For entrees  we split the Tamarind Spicy Noodles with chicken (not very spicy  but I was happy that way)  which was delicious.  We also split the Pad Kee Mao  which was also very flavorful and tasty  though I personally could have used a touch more basil (I loves me some Thai basil!).  I didn't order the Som Tom because the menu says it's made with cabbage instead of green papaya... and that ain't how I rolllll  yo.  I originally was gonna rate it a 3 (mostly because I was disappointed with the attempted cabbage fake-out and the meh tom kha gai)  but I had a change of heart... everything else was yummy.  Rock on.\n",
      "If you like Thai food  definitely go to Tamarind. Extensive menu with a nice assortment of soups. Whenever I go to a Thai restaurant for the first time I always have the Pad Thai. I mean  if you can't do a good Pad Thai you will probably fail miserably in the rest. Very delicate with the right amount of fish sauce and tamarind. Service is good and the restaurant is not pricey. Highly recommended!\n",
      "Two words:  Veggie friendly!  And without losing any of the essential Thai flavors.  Loved this place for solid  right on  perfectly spicy and delectable Thai food.  Small casual place where it's all about quality food!  The menu is huge and all the typical Thai dishes are great.  Loved the papaya salad  green curry  vegetable radna  and fresh summer rolls. BYOB.\n",
      "Affordable! Delicious! BYOB!  I got the vegetarian pad thai. It came with broccoli and zucchini which was a little strange but still delicious. My only complaint is that they had no Thai desserts. I'm not sure if it is a seasonal thing but I was really hoping for some mango sticky rice or durian ice cream and all they had were different types of truffles.\n",
      "Staff are friendly and helpful. Foods are tasty  many choices  reasonable price. But Tom Yum can be make it better (I think). Recommend to make a reservation in advance due to limited tables. Parking can be easy to find on the street. Definitely will come back again.\n",
      "Just A-OK as a 3 implies. I'd come back only out of convenience because I live nearby but not because the food is spectacular. Hmm... this is the third Thai restaurant I've tried in Philly and unfortunately  it's just not like home!   The good: BYOB. Decor is cute. Staff is very friendly and attentive. Also  dishes were decent priced at around $10-15 per entree and $3-8 for appetizers. They have spiciness levels from 1 - 7. Stick with around 2 or 3 if you're scared and ask them to bring you extra chile.   The OK: The Pad Thai was not bad. It had everything Pad Thai should have but something seemed missing. The noodles also tasted a little undercooked. The mussels were decent but I don't think worth the price (it came out to a dollar/mussel).  The bad: One of my things to judge a Thai restaurant is to get Panang Curry because it's my favorite. First off  it was very watery and needed some thickness to it. The curry sauce itself was salty and I could really taste the fish sauce for some reason (I don't even know if they add fish sauce usually).  I got this with beef and felt that the beef should've been thicker. Also  the carrots just didn't give it the right taste I was looking for. Maybe it was the size of everything. Big veggies and small meat equals a no no!    Also  they seem to be pretty busy on a Saturday night so you may want to call in and make reservations just in case. Overall  I saw some really good entrees come out for other people so I wouldn't mind coming back and giving it another try.\n",
      "I can't recall the last time I had Thai food. And I love a good Thai meal. And good BYO  and a decently priced restaurant.  Enter Tamarind.  Quinn lives around the corner for this spot and had never tried it out. It was a perfect spot for us to hit before catching a movie. Before dinner  I did some research and found that a riesling is probably the best wine pairing for Asian food. I picked one up that wasn't too fruity  yet had enough flavor to compliment the relatively big tastes served up by Tamarind.  We only had a short wait on a Friday night. Once inside  we were seated quickly and the impeccable service began immediately. Before we have even settled down at our table they took our bottle of win and brought it back in a wine chiller. The atmosphere is nothing special  but enjoyable enough. It's a good place to grab food  but you're not going to impress anyone here either.  The menu offers a lot of different choices  and I could be happy eating here a few times without repeating anything. We split appetizers of the chicken spring roll and steamed dumplings to start out. Both of these offered a lot of different flavors  and they were excellent renditions of standard dishes. Neither did anything new or exciting  they were just good. And I like that.  Shortly after we finished our first course  the mains showed up. The first was a Tamarind Spicy Noodle dish with pork. I liked this a lot  with the pork stir-fried with red pepper and large noodles. It was the heavier of the two dishes we ordered. It was good  but the real star of the meal was Pad Wonsoon. it's a rendition of a standard Pad Thai dish  with chicken and shrimp.  Overall  it's very tasty  with the dish complimented by glass noodles.  Bottom Line: Tamarind is not breaking new ground  but they understand their food and craft well.  There's so much to like about Tamarind. It's not going to change your life  but they provide great Thai dishes at reasonable prices and a BYOB to boot.\n",
      "I've had this place bookmarked for so long and I finally went.  The food is great. I was a bit bummed my Beef Pad Thai didn't come with more meat  but the sauce and quality were great.  This place is byob which is cool. Prices are great.  The inside could use some more character.  Overall  I'll be returning.\n",
      "I had a big group of 15 here last night  and they accommodated us very well. They quickly got our beer on ice and opened our wine. (It's a BYOB which makes it fantastic!) Our bill only came to about $240 after the tip was included for the entire party! The food was great and didn't take too long to come out. The food is seriously spicy if you ask for it to be spicy! However  some in our party don't do spice at all  and their food turned out great too!\n",
      "I have even waiting in line to see when the next availability was for my lane... I came up to the line that I requested my name bc there was some lanes available and apparently the manager  SEAN... Was very hostile towards me stating that ppl had purchased the lane and there was nothing I could or he could do about it. It was fine until he ended up getting loud with me. It was a question and wasn't trying to be hostile towards him... Until I spoke with  justin... Who apologized for Sean's actions and confirmed our spot and explained to us that there was a party that had purchased a couple of hours of the lane. I wish the manager  Sean  would of explained things better than freak out on me. Def not my intention... Clearly  Sean does not know how to work under pressure... But  thanks justin... You have been great!\n",
      "Heard great things about lucky strike in other cities was really excited to go. Interior was cool and bartenders looked decent. However front desk staff was absolutely horrible. Not sure if it was his first day or not but if so he shouldn't have been alone taking care of customers. We waited 25 min in line just to get a lane mind you there were only two people in front of us... there was not Many people there so I couldn't really understand why service was so lax. Then our lane wouldn't work and it took another 20 minutes for them just to get someone to look into the problem for us. Manager didn't even come over to our lane to remedy the situation. Majority of staff did not know what they were doing. We waited 45 minutes and didn't even bowl  eventually after waiting all that time we asked for our money because we couldn't wait any longer. Staff had attitude when we expressed our frustrations. Extremely disappointed will not be back unless they decide to fix these issues\n",
      "I like talking with my friends when I bowl  but I do not need an overpriced place like this to do it.  Yea yea  I live in a city but hush  you  I want fun at a reasonable price.  Go during an earlier time to beat some of the crowd.  The time I went our wait was a pretty reasonable time and we got our lane before we expected it.  The food here is pretty good  and by good I mean greasy goodness snack time!  The drinks seemed a tad bit pricey but looked very cute.  I really like the whole atmosphere of this place  but the price tag just made me bump down a star.  And the fact that our waitress didn't help move our food from the waiting/lounge portion to our lane when we finally got one (i.e. utensils and napkins for six  six plates  and three plates of food  on top of each of us carrying our awesome bowling shoes. just great).\n",
      "\n",
      "2nd floor bar   the man bartender was only serving men with skinny jeans and deep V neck shirts! He would ignore everyone else! I feel like he was very bias toward the straight guys and woman! Very poor service and will never come back here even if I had to drop a deuce in the bathroom!\n",
      "Came here this past Thursday to grab some drinks and a bartender here named Dennis cured my cold. I asked him to make me some kind of mojito that would clear my sinuses and that he did with a rumplemintz mojito. It was delicious and it cleared my sinuses  what more can I ask for!\n",
      "I like this place. It was pretty fun. I did come during the day however  where it was not so crowded as it is supposed to be at night. The atmosphere was  well  fun. We had a few snacky snacks which were okay .. obviously much better then typical bowling lane food. Leather sofas at the score tables rather then hard plastic benches. Funky decor. Loud music/TV. Fun  fun  fun for everyone.  I'm not one to be caught in the Philla Philla ... but if you were to find me  I'd probably be here !\n",
      "i like my bowling establishments to not be so overtly racist with their dress codes.  And if you think that no baggy pants  no baseball caps  no timberlands isn't trying to say no blacks  you are living in an airy fairy dream world   I didn't realize that the black community wreaked such havoc on bowling alleys.\n",
      "***Review not based on food***  TLDR: Highly recommend the bottomless bowling special  and the front desk dude is dope.   I went with a couple of my friends for the Mon-Thurs bottomless bowling  and I would do it again in a heartbeat. It's $15 for all you can bowl  with free pool and shuffleboard. This is a great deal  and the place was empty enough that we were able to step away from our lane  play some pool and shuffleboard  and start playing again without being bumped from our lane.   Some stuff to note is that the pins got stuck in the gutter a couple times  but they were able to fix that promptly. As for the drinks  service was kind of spotty. We ordered and paid for a cider  only to be promised the empty keg would be changed. We checked in twice with the bartender in ~30 min  only to have her finally admit the keg would not be changed that night. We were able to get a more expensive cocktail at the same price  but it was a hassle.   The reason lucky strike still gets 5 stars from me is cause the front desk guy is awesome. There was a shattered glass incident  and he was very chill about it  and even offered to get us a new drink on the house. He was also super receptive to whenever the lanes needed fixing.  Super impressed!  As for enforced dress code after 9pm  as long as you don't show up in sweatpants you're good. People were dressed very casually.\n",
      "I participate in a bowling league at Lucky Strike on Sundays.  We always waste time waiting for the lane to be fixed after it breaks down.  I'm pretty sure we've had some kind of malfunction every week.  The waitstaff never know what drink specials we're supposed to have.  This isn't their fault  someone in management needs to let them know because we come every week. The bathroom is pretty gross for what is supposed to be a nice place. I will return just because its the closest place for me to bowl.  I miss Strikes in UC.\n",
      "it is a really nice place  friendly atmosphere and food is delicious. But it is big problem with the parking we spend 30 min looking for place to park\n",
      "I went here for a birthday dinner with a party of 6 and had an amazing time. Although they do not take reservations  I called on the way there to ask if they were busy and they said no. The entrance is a little weird because there is no waiting area where the hostess can seat you  just tables where people were eating so it made things a bit confusing and awkward. We had to wait around 5 minutes for our table to be set up and we were promptly seated. The restaurant is very small but has a cosy and authentic Italian feel to it.  Our waiter was very nice and knowledgable about the food and his descriptions for the specials of the day made me want everything. He literally could describe dirt and we would still eat it. I asked for any recommendations with meat sauce and he said they could prepare a bolognese sauce with linguini pasta and feta cheese which was sooooo good.   When we were done  they came out with three huge scoops of gelato and a candle for dessert. The scoop of hazelnut was so rich in flavor and everyone fought to get a bite.  Overall  I had a great experience and this will definitely be a usual spot for us in the future!\n",
      "Would not have ever discovered this place if not for Yelp. I was looking for a nice Italian place to take the boyfriend for his birthday. This place is very small  cute & romantic. We went around 6PM so it was very dark with dim lights inside which gave it the romantic feel to it. Judging from some pictures  it looks like it'd be really nice to go in the morning too.  One of their walls were lined with wine corks & another from something that looks like crates. And there were even more things made from wine corks around. Really cool. The other wall was basically a giant window which allows them to use the natural light which I like.  We were very quickly seated & asked what we'd like to drink. Someone also came over & told us a few things they recommended. After order  they will bring you a basket of bread & bruschetta.  Grilled Octopus $16 appetizer/salad was good but some parts were pretty salty.  Chicken Locanda $20 \\their version of chicken parmigiana\\\" should definitely have been in the salad menu. It says on their website that it comes with a \\\"side linguine.\\\" I didn't catch that that night but we did not get that.  Shrimp & Scallop special was about $25. The shrimp & scallop part was pretty good but the sauce tasted a bit water down & was not hot enough. They also only gave you 2 shrimps.  I think this place was cute but I don't think I'll be back. The food was not something that could compete when there are so many options. But the design of the inside was something I really enjoyed.\"\n",
      "LOVE this little place! I feel like Ive been to just about every BYO in Philadelphia  but the atmosphere  staff  and especially the FOOD at this little place are just PHENOMINAL!!  I highly recommend everything on the menu.  It's just the perfect place to sit outside with some friends  a bottle of wine  and a lot of laughter.  I cant wait to go back!\n",
      "What a wonderful byob italian restaurant! I went here on a Tuesday night for dinner with the boyfriend. It was such a lovely surprise. The food is wonderful  fresh and tasty. Nothing felt or tasted frozen or bagged. The service was helpful  informative  and kind  which is always a huge plus for me. The buffalo mozzarella salad was so good and way too filling for an appetizer  always always have room for your entree and dessert! The bf had mussels in red sauce  I am allergic to shellfish  but he said the sauce was heavenly. Again  too filling for an app with the bread  to dip as well. Since we were almost full with the wine  bread and apps  we ordered one entree  a special  filet with gorgonzola. The cheese was stronger than I expected but the filet was cooked very well  temperature was on point. By this time  I had decided to host my brother's upcoming birthday dinner at this place. I inquired and told them what I wanted to do and we may be 15-20 people. They gave me a pre fix menu price  I agreed then they sent over a complimentary dessert (gelato) to finish off our evening. All in all  a delicious and pleasant evening.  A couple weeks later was my brother's birthday dinner on a Friday evening. It was crowded but they had the table ready  we had settled on 15 but 3 more showed up and they were able to accommodate quickly and smoothly. Bc it was such a large part you can only make the dinner at tail ends of their hours - either 5pm or 9pm. We opted for  the 9pm. Once we settled  they opened up our wines quickly then served the apps - It was family style - prosciutto with mozzarella  fresh and seasoned artichoke with shrimp. seasoned peppers  calamari salad (one of my faves!) an dso much more that just kept coming! Then everyone ordered off the menu for their entree then family style dessert with coffee or cappuccino  all for $45 person  with tax and tip $57. And we had all the wine we wanted to drink bc it's byo! What a great idea! I can't wait to do this for my birthday dinner. I will definitely be a return customer and I will get that calamari salad.  Some negatives are that parking can be a bit difficult  there are pan handlers nearby and cobblestone streets.\n",
      "Yummers to the 'nth degree.  Pasta  why do I love thee so?  Why must you be prepared so deliciously here?  Why are you so heavy-laden with carbohydrates that I must avoid you most of the year? Why  is it that I let my guard down at Raddichio and consume you until I wipe my plate clean? Why??  Even crowded on Monday nights (a tell-tale sign that this place is not only good  it's popular)  this cute corner BYOB is a neighborhood staple and along with La Locanda (a couple blocks over)  it's a solid go-to choice for local italian BYO around Old City.    Dinner progression goes like this: crusty bread  complimentary fresh bruschetta to start.  Wicked garlicky goodness of mussels followed by a favorite of mine  Penne Toto  that is liberally doused with mouth-watering prosciutto  shallots and a pink vodka cream sauce.  Get in my belly!  All their seafood is good here too  and the fish of the day is always fresh and well-prepared.    Service is fast  sometimes rushed and a little impersonal.  Menu consists of good  standard Italian dishes except the Scallops Al Radicchio -  which are bland and the scallops are almost invisible (more white beans than anything) - skip it - and try their calamari instead.  Also  appears like frequent patrons (or family and friends of the owner?) get preferential seating and even reservations - even though the restaurant does not offer them.  I guess if you show up here in a Porsche or a Corvette Stingray  it guarantees you the first and best table in the joint.\n",
      "Delicious lunch! We had the amazing swordfish carpaccio  veal Marsala  and Veal and Shrimp. Everything was delicious and fresh! I ordered Tiramisu to go because I was too full which was a mistake. Their wrapping ruined the whole thing by the time I got home. Will not be getting takeout next time.\n",

      "I'm Italian with (I've been told) very high standards about \\ Italian Restairants\\\". True to be told....it difficult to find a place that I would honestly call good. Well Radicchio is good! The appetizers (or antipasti)... The burrata is outstanding  and by burrata I mean the entire burrata  not just a little piece. The grilled calamari (a special for that night) sorry tender and flavourful. The main course (primo e secondo piatto)... I ordered the special with \\\"linguine al nero di seppia\\\" (black ink squid linguine) with scallops and shrimps...delicious! My friends ordered the \\\"cotoletta\\\" o \\\"Milanese\\\" (veal Milanese) well maybe not as thin as you would get it in Italy but probably the best one I had in the US! And the \\\"Regatoni Toto\\\" (although I would spell them R-I-Gatoni). Extremely good  tasty and light  despite the creamy sauce. Definitely a hidden gem worth to be discovered!  PS. BYOB!!!!\"\n",
      "Love it! BYOB so that'll save you some money. I got the penne pasta with shrimp and scallops  it was delicious and came out very fast. The wait staff is very attentive and friendly. It is on a quiet block and the perfect place to eat outside on a nice night\n",
      "Cozy and comfortable  with true Sicilian flare. Try the Bisteca  the Lamb in the style of the horse  or any of the pastas. Actually  for the price (and the fact that it's BYOB)  try them all! Service is friendly and on spot. Loved our hold experience and will be returning as often as permitted.\n",
      "This is the best restaurant in Philadelphia in my humble opinion.  Hands down.  Forget Le Bec Fin  Morimoto's  or any of those other over-priced traps.  And forget Sabrina's Cafe for your weekend brunch  go across the street to Monsù instead.  It rocks.    The cuisine is Sicilian and I'm very fussy when it comes to Italian food.  I can maybe think of one or two other Italian restaurants that are worth my time  and this place meets my high standards without a doubt.  Every appetizer and every entrée is perfect...PERFECT!  I've never had a bad experience  much less a bad meal  here.  They have a brunch menu that serves the BEST Eggs Benedict I've ever had  and I don't normally even LIKE Eggs Benedict at all -- but I LOVE theirs.  They serve scrapple (\\scrappola\\\" they call it) that is absolutely delicious -- and I'm a tough customer when it comes to scrapple  I don't like anybody \\\"fancy-ing up\\\" my scrapple.  Monsù does scrapple right  they make it their own without overdoing anything or diverging too much from what makes scrapple so great.  Their arancini is amazing.  I've tried MAKING arancini  and it's hard...it's particularly hard to make stuffed arancini because the rice tends to fall apart when you're trying to stuff it.  They do it perfectly  and it's delicious.  I can't recommend this place enough.  Do yourself a favor...stop doing whatever you're doing  and just go...right now.  Go!\"\n",
      "Best calamari of my life! Definitely do the tourista menu. I had the calamari  a shrimp pasta  and swordfish and everything was amazing! The service was also great  the chef even came out to meet everyone and he was a very nice guy! Will absolutely be back!\n",
      "Any restaurant that would use a gimmick like putting horse meat on the menu just because it is in the news is a restaurant with a severe lack of integrity.  What's next  pink slime burgers?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wow  what a fantastic place. We have been twice and thoroughly enjoyed both meals. It is a cash only  BYOB place with a very friendly staff. I have had the tavola caldi (mixed plate of food)  and the eggs benedict with pork  and some other delicious stuff. I don't even like eggs benedict but I will order that plat every time. Plus  their foccaccia bread with oil is to so delicious....love this restaurant!\n",
      "Went for dinner on a hot summer night in early July 2012.  I had high hopes  unfortunately  I wasn't impressed. Overall  the food wasn't bad but it is also not spectacular. I wanted to like to the food but I thought they were all over-seasoned (read: very salty).  The saffron rice ball was pretty good. The tagliatelle with mushrooms was so salty that it was almost inedible. The mackerel was okay. The Osso Bucco was tender but lacks in flavor (perhaps after the tagliatell my taste buds were numb).\n",
      "I love Modo Mio.  I love Paesano's.  So Monsu was clearly the next place to go for me.  Walking in to the old Paesano's location really made me want a Paesano's sandwich more than anything.  For Paesano's fans  I don't think there is enough of a decor change to elicit any other reaction than missing Paesono's.  On to the food.  I must say  it probably would have gotten 4 stars but for my entree.  We started with the mussels  the grilled mozzarella  and the arancia.  The short rib ragu in the arancia was delicious.  The mussels and the grilled mozzarella were satisfying  but not knock your socks off.    We then moved on to a half pasta dish.  I really like the fact that you can order a half-pasta  especially because all of the pastas sounded amazing.  We ordered the casatelle - which was fantastic.  Our dining partners shared the gnocci and really enjoyed that as well.  On to the entrees . . . . we ordered the rib - eye and were pretty disappointed with it.  It was over-salted and just not a great dish.   Our dining companions chose the osso bucco  which they seemed to enjoy.  I left wishing we'd ordered more pastas instead of opting for the entrees.  So I think I will definitely go back  but just stick to the pastas.\n",

      "This is a great secret spot in Philly. I have been here twice. First was for brunch and everything was delicious. Last time i took my whole family who was in town for my graduation. I love the atmosphere and the service! Everybody is nice and helpful and the small restaurant feels very cozy. The food is very good  i love the tasting menu because allows you to try different things for 40$. You must be wondering why i gave them four stars. Well  most of the food including the home made bread and the desserts (tiramisu) were great  but two of them: the gnochi and the vegetarian pasta with mushrooms and lemon not so much. Too much lemon on them for me  i also asked to have the rest of my food in a box to take it home and they forgot about it. Nevertheless I still like it a lot and i'll definitely would go back next time i'm in town.\n",
